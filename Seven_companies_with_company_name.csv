KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered strong top-line growth, comparable operating margin expansion, and earnings per-share growth. Our strategy is working.

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"And given our year-to-date performance, we are raising both our top-line and bottom-line guidance. This morning, I'll provide a brief update on the global consumer landscape, then I'll focus much of my time on business performance across the segments and discuss how we've been investing to further strengthen our capabilities to capture longer-term growth opportunities. John will end by discussing financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for full year 2023, and some early considerations for 2024. The global operating environment is always dynamic, and this quarter was no exception.","Raising guidance, Global consumer landscape, Business performance, Investing in

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Some markets improved sequentially, while others dealt with a variety of factors, ranging from transitory weather conditions, ongoing inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and conflicts. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth this quarter, driven by positive volume, some pricing actions in the marketplace, and carryover pricing coming into the base from last year. Volume grew 2% and sequentially improved each month in the quarter with September being our strongest month. Our year-to-date volume growth remains consistent with underlying performance compared to 2019.","Market performance, Revenue growth, Volume growth,

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"And overall, our industry remains vibrant and is expanding, and we are executing to capture that growth. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. Consumer sentiment continues to vary around the world. In developed markets, consumer spending in aggregate has held up quite well.","Industry growth, Volume and value share, Consumer sentiment, Global markets,

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"However, some consumers feel pressured. We've seen some shift to discount channels and switching to private label brands in a few markets and categories. The intensity of this activity was largely the same across Europe compared to the previous quarter but was less pronounced in the U.S., Australia, and Japan. In the developing and emerging markets, the picture is more mixed.","Consumers feeling pressured, Shift to discount channels, Switching to private

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"We're seeing broadly consumer strength across Latin America, India, and in parts of Central and Southeast Asia. On the other hand, consumer confidence in spending has yet to fully recover in Africa and China. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities give us a distinct advantage, and we are leveraging these capabilities to ensure we have the right product in the right package in the right channel and at the right price points to meet consumers where they are. Notwithstanding the dynamics in play around the world, we have many levers to pull and continue to deliver through varying market conditions.","Broad consumer strength, Execution capabilities, Market dynamics, Geographical

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"I'll share some more details from each region. Starting with Asia Pacific. We delivered organic revenue growth, but operating income declined, primarily as a result of investing ahead of the curve to participate in longer-term opportunities and incurring additional costs from strategic portfolio rationalization. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we grew top line and profit by linking our brands to drinking occasions, coupled with strong execution.","Asia Pacific, Organic revenue growth, Operating income, Strategic portfolio

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In Thailand, we launched Coke Kitchen, which connected consumers to influencers who share their favorite recipes with Coca-Cola. We also partnered with foodservice aggregators to drive combo meals.

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"We continue to see strong momentum from our Coca-Cola, Georgia Coffee and I LOHAS campaigns and have stepped up execution in vending, e-commerce and community channels. However, in China, volume declined as the sparkling soft drink category is taking longer to recover. Our results were also impacted by some strategic conditions that deprioritize lower-profit categories.

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In India, we delivered double-digit volume and top-line growth, which resulted in the highest value share gain over the past three years. We're winning in the marketplace by generating 2.6 billion transactions at affordable price points and driving availability across rural regions. Across Asia Pacific, as part of our World Without Waste strategy to help drive a circular economy for packaging materials, our system launched 100% recycled PET packaging in India, Indonesia, and Thailand.

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"We delivered strong organic revenue and operating income growth. In Africa, macro conditions remain challenging, and our business was further impacted by natural disasters in Morocco and Libya. Despite this environment, we drove transaction growth through accelerated refillable PET expansion, digitizing nearly 100,000 outlets and adding 80,000 coolers year to date.

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Despite these dynamics, we gained value share through strong performances in sparkling soft drinks and tea. We did this by partnering with our system to drive value for key customers and our consumers. We continue to see promising early results for Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola in Europe.

They also launched 100% recycled PET package this summer. In North America, we generated strong organic revenue growth and delivered margin expansion by executing across our total beverage portfolio.

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Within sparkling soft drinks, elasticities are holding up well, and we continue to drive quality leadership with Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta. For example, our systems stepped up in-store activation on Sprite Lymonade legacy with increased displays at point of sale, which drove higher household penetration and repeat purchases. Fanta drove nearly 2 points of vale share gain year to date through innovations and new graphics, including the latest Halloween iteration of the WhatTheFanta platform.

And in the U.S., to protect water resources, we renewed a decade-long partnership with the Department of Agriculture to restore and improve watersheds in national forests and grasslands. Water is a critical priority for our system and the communities that we serve. In Latin America, we generated double-digit top-line and profit growth by executing on all facets of our strategy, which resulted in value share gains in four of our top five markets.","Fairlife, Core Power, smartwater, Gold Peak, Value share gain",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In the fifth market, Mexico, we're seeing improving value share trends over the last few months. We're increasingly linking our brands to consumers' passion points to build deeper connections. In Brazil, through Coke Studio, we partnered with the town music festival, where we hosted 60 hours of concert and engaged with artists and influencers, which generated 1 billion impressions and reached nearly 50 million consumers.

KO,2023,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In developing and emerging markets, refillables are an important tool, both to eliminate waste and offer products at lower price points. Last, our systems stepped up availability, replacing over 270,000 coolers year to date, which increased our share of visible inventory in [Inaudible]. Global ventures generated strong overall growth.

Price/mix growth was 9%, driven by pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets, along with carryover pricing, coming into the base from last year. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds.

KO,2023,3,John Murphy,President and Chief Financial Officer,"This was primarily driven by strong top-line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.74 was up 7% year over year despite higher-than- expected 4% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $7.9 billion year to date.

Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 90 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top-line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments and higher operating costs versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds.

Notwithstanding higher costs and continued investments in the marketplace, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 100 basis points, driven by strong top-line growth.

We estimate the underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023.

I will briefly touch on the drivers of our second quarter performance and the update to our full year 2022 guidance, then I'll provide commentary on building resilience in our business by investing behind our brands and driving top-line-led growth. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our business around the world. This has translated into strong top line and comparable EPS growth, notwithstanding the larger-than-expected currency headwinds, and increased cost pressures.","drivers of performance, full year guidance, resilience, brand investment, top-line

KO,2022,2,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"We delivered organic revenue growth of 16%. Unit cases grew 8% with broad-based growth across all operating segments. Concentrate sales were behind unit cases by four points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and our Europe, Middle East, and Africa group. Our price/mix of 12% was primarily driven by strategic pricing actions across markets, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets, and positive segment mix.","organic revenue growth, unit cases, concentrate sales, price/mix, strategic
pricing actions",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2022,2,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 250 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of three items: one, an upsized increase in costs in the business due to the inflationary environment; two, currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop; and three, the mechanical effect of consolidating the Bodyarmor finished goods business. On the marketing front, we increased our consumer and customer-facing spending to create more value for our brands and continue to earn their respective price points. Despite increased investments and costs throughout the P&L, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 40 basis points, driven by a higher return from our investments in the marketplace. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 110 basis points due to the Bodyarmor acquisition and currency headwinds.","gross margin, inflationary environment, currency headwinds, marketing spending,

KO,2022,2,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Putting this all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.70 grew 4% year over year. And this was impacted by nine points of currency headwinds, five points higher than what we'd anticipated when we last gave guidance. On cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $4.1 billion year to date, driven by our strong business performance. This was 20% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to two items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter.","second quarter EPS, currency headwinds, cash flow, working capital benefits,

And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments.

KO,2022,2,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"While our shipments are currently behind unit cases, we expect these to run in line for the full year with the catch-up expected in the fourth quarter. We now expect that the direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspensions of business in Russia, will be approximately $0.03 to comparable EPS. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect commodity price inflation to move to a high single-digit impact from mid-single digits on comparable cost-of-goods sold in 2022. This is primarily due to commodity cost increases across our concentrate and finished goods businesses.","shipments, full year, direct impact, Ukraine conflict, commodity price inflation",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2022,2,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Other costs, including wages, transportation, media, and operating expenses, are also increasing and adding incremental pressures. The consolidation of the Bodyarmor finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins, partially offset by the impact of refranchising our Vietnam and Cambodia bottling operations. And lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our exposure to floating rate debt.

We delivered 8% unit case volume growth, primarily driven by strong recovery in away-from-home channels and continued growth in at-home channels.

In the fourth quarter, we closed the year with strong results, despite the impact of the omicron variant across many parts of the world. Our Q4 organic revenue growth was 9%.

KO,2021,4,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Unit case growth showed further sequential improvement on a two-year basis, and concentrate sales lagged unit cases by 10 points in the quarter, primarily due to six fewer days in the quarter. Despite the commodity market inflation and the dynamic supply chain environment, comparable gross margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus prior year. Pricing initiatives and favorable channel and package mix were offset by the impact of consolidating the fast-growing finished goods BODYARMOR business, along with incremental investments to sustain momentum in the overall business for 2022.

Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 3-point currency headwind to comparable revenue and an approximate 3 to 4 points currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, due to a certain change in recent regulations, we estimate an effective tax rate increase from 18.6% in 2021 to 20% for 2022, which is an estimated 2 percentage points headwind to EPS.","Guidance, revenue growth, earnings per share growth, currency headwinds, tax rate

We expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow over 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. This implies the fourth consecutive year of free cash flow conversion above our long-term range of 90% to 95%.

However, we are taking actions in the marketplace using multiple levers, including RGM in its many forms, along with our productivity initiatives, to help offset much of the impact.

outlook, 2022 thoughts",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2021,3,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, James. In the third quarter, we delivered another set of strong results, building on the momentum we've seen this year. Our Q3 organic revenue was up 14% with concentrate shipments up 8% and price/mix up 6%. Price/mix was led by strong pricing in North America and Latin America and further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets.","Q3 results, organic revenue, concentrate shipments, price/mix, geographic
performance",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2021,3,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Unit case growth was 6% with absolute unit cases ahead of 2019 levels for the first time this year and a sequential improvement versus the second quarter on a two-year basis. Concentrate shipment outpaced unit cases in the quarter due to inventory build by some of our bottling partners to manage through near-term disruption. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 160 basis points versus prior year, driven by pricing in the market, positive mix and timing of shipments. Despite some pressure points in the supply chain, we're successfully pulling the levers at our disposal to mitigate impacts to the best of our ability.","unit case growth, concentrate shipments, comparable gross margin, supply chain
pressure, inventory build",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2021,3,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"We continued to invest as many markets reopened during the quarter and significantly stepped up our marketing dollars versus prior year. As a result, our comparable operating margin compressed by 40 basis points year over year, more than offsetting the flow-through from the strong top line. Below operating income, we saw some leverage come through from the other income line and a lower tax rate for the quarter that was driven by our updated effective tax rate for the full year to 18.6% from 19.1% previously. Putting all of this together, third-quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.65 was an increase of 18% year over year, including a three-point benefit from currency.","investment, marketing spend, comparable operating margin, other income, tax rate",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2021,3,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"We also delivered strong year to date free cash flow of $8.5 billion. Given our strong results and with one quarter remaining, we have good visibility and are raising guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 13% to 14%, which is at the high end of our previously provided range, and comparable EPS growth of 15% to 17% in 2021. Our updated guidance for free cash flow of approximately $10.5 billion represent significant progress over the past few years and particularly during the COVID era.","year-to-date free cash flow, full-year guidance, organic revenue growth,

KO,2021,3,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"This progress is further dimensionalized as follows: We expect to achieve this year a dividend payout ratio below our long-term target of 75% of free cash flow for the time since 2015. We anticipate delivering another year of free cash flow conversion above 100%. And finally, our expected free cash flow has almost doubled since 2017.

KO,2021,3,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"So, as we think about Q4, a few things to keep in mind. One, the recovery phase looks different around the world, and we expect that to continue. Two, we continue to see a minimal commodity impact due to hedges we have in place for the remainder of the year. Three, from a marketing perspective, we expect to increase consumer-facing marketing spend toward levels similar to 2019 while improving the quality of that spend and allocating it in a more targeted manner.","Q4 recovery, commodity impact, marketing spend, targeted marketing, consumer-
facing marketing",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2021,3,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Four, our currency outlook continues to contemplate a tailwind of 1% to 2% to the top line and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedge position. Last but not least, our current full-year guidance has built in the leveling out of our concentrate shipments that are running ahead year to date due to timing considering that we have six fewer days in the fourth quarter. It's not typical for us to provide commentary on the year ahead at this stage, but I would like to highlight a few points regarding 2022 given the dynamics we are already seeing. While there are puts and takes to consider from the pandemic looking into next year, we're confident in the underlying top line trajectory, supported by our transformation work, our innovation agenda and a more efficient and effective approach to marketing.","currency outlook, concentrate shipments, full-year guidance, transformation
work, innovation agenda",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2021,3,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Along with this ongoing momentum in revenues, we also expect to see some higher costs. We are not immune to the commodity inflation that has been impacting the world for the better part of 2021 nor the rapidly changing environment. We've been successful with hedges that were put in place to mitigate the impact of input cost inflation, and those will begin to roll off in 2022. Based on current rates and hedge position, we'd expect commodity inflation to have a mid-single-digit impact on our cost of goods sold in 2022.","ongoing momentum, commodity inflation, hedges, cost of goods Sold, mid-single-

KO,2021,3,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Regarding currency, if we were to assume current rates and our hedge position, there would be an approximate two to three-point currency headwind to revenue and a two to three-point headwind to earnings for the full-year 2022. Of course, volatility remains, and several factors could have an impact on our currency outlook between now and February. Overall, as vaccinations continue to progress globally, we are in a better position today to navigate this environment, and we feel good about the potential for our business. We look forward to coming back with more specific items after the fourth quarter.","currency headwind, revenue, earnings, vaccination progress, potential business

The alignment of our system and its deft navigation through a challenging supply environment and an asynchronous pandemic recovery have been key enablers to emerging stronger.

KO,2021,2,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We started 2021 with promising results. Mobility and business levels improved in the first quarter, and this trend continued in the second.

KO,2021,2,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Consumers have started to return to many prior routine. And as a result, our away-from-home volumes steadily improved as a percent of our business this quarter, driving strong price mix and margin acceleration across the enterprise. However, the recovery remains asynchronous. And several parts of the world have dealt with further waves of infections, leading to delayed openings and in some cases, heightened restrictions.","consumer return, away-from-home volumes, price mix, margin acceleration,

KO,2021,2,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"India and Southeast Asia were our only areas that did not see sequential volume acceleration on a two year basis this quarter. Despite the asynchronous recovery, our revenues and earnings in the second quarter surpassed our 2019 results. We also made progress on share this quarter. We said many times that gaining share is a key objective in our emerging stronger agenda.","India, Southeast Asia, sequential volume acceleration, earnings, share gain",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2021,2,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I'm pleased to report that we have achieved that objective with broad-based share gains across categories as well as in both our at-home and away-from-home channels in the quarter. And importantly, despite away-from-home channels not having fully recovered, our value share today is higher than the 2019 levels, confirming that our effective brand building and innovation along with our advanced revenue growth management and market execution capabilities are working. So let me dive a bit deeper into the key drivers across our geographies.

KO,2021,2,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We outpaced the overall macroeconomic recovery, led by strong performance in away-from-home channels and business-to-consumer e-commerce. Australia and New Zealand were bright spots, performing at or close to 2019 levels, but they are currently seeing renewed lockdowns. While Japan is struggling to come out of lockdown, there have been tangible successes with consumer-led innovation, small-pack initiatives and improved customer execution of key initiatives.

In EMEA, Europe is still being impacted by some level of restriction, but vaccination rates and consumer confidence are improving. Because of this and our strong bottle alignment and marketing investments, we are seeing a much improved away-from-home mix even as at-home volumes continue to grow.

Thorough analysis has led us to believe we will ultimately be successful.

It is possible that all or some portion of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and affirmed by the Tax Court could be upheld. To this end, we have estimated approximately $12 billion for the aggregate incremental tax liability for years up to and including 2020, including interests accrued through December 31, 2020.

But as James mentioned, we saw a slowdown in December due to a resurgence in the virus and increased lockdown restrictions in many markets. The contraction in the comparable gross margin was primarily driven by continued pressure on our channel and packaged mix between away-from-home and at-home, as well as currency headwinds. Additionally, segment mix swung to a headwind in the quarter due to outperformance of our bottling investments group.","October and

KO,2020,4,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Comparable operating margin expanded through ongoing disciplined cost management more than offsetting pressure from the top line. It's worth noting the decline in SG&A spend this quarter was impacted by timing due to the phasing effect of marketing reduction over the year. As we've previously stated, we have been reintroducing marketing spend in a targeted way, identifying compelling opportunities to invest across countries, categories, and brands. Fourth-quarter comparable EPS of $0.47 represents an increase of 6%, and full-year comparable earnings of $1.95 reflects an 8% decline relative to our 2019 results.","Comparable

Our improving level of visibility into recovery as the year goes on, as well as the many lessons we've learned in the last year, have enabled us to provide an outlook for 2021.

In the third quarter, we continued to rebound from the pressures we experienced at the peak of the lockdown as the world generally moves into the recovery phase. That said, the trajectory of our business trends continue to be closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of the lockdowns in the market.

KO,2020,3,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Much of the sequential improvement has been driven by the away-from-home channels which represent roughly half of our business globally. Our away-from-home volume was down in the mid-teens in the quarter, a significant improvement from the April lows which approached 50% declines. This was driven by the agility of our sales teams throughout the system and the efforts to create value for our customers during the gradual reopening phase.

We've just closed the books on what has arguably been the toughest and most complex quarter in Coca-Cola history. And given the global pandemic, of course, this comes as no surprise. From the initial lockdowns and closures of hundreds of thousands of our customer outlets to the gradual reopening and now another round of spikes in various countries, the impacts have been profound.","Toughest

KO,2020,2,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In this challenging environment, we've seen some remarkable actions around the world, and I'd like to express my thanks to the countless people on the front lines who are working to improve our communities worldwide. And I'd also like to recognize my colleagues across the Coca-Cola Company and our bottling system for their tireless efforts in prioritizing the safety of our people, ensuring the resiliency of our supply chain, supporting our millions of customers globally and for being a force of good in their communities. As we navigated the quarter, we used a combination of focus and flexibility to manage through what we believe will be the peak levels of global lockdown. John will discuss the results in further detail, but as you think about the quarter and consider the future, I'd like to highlight the strong relationship of our performance with the intersection of two key factors.","Remarkable

KO,2020,2,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"The trajectory of our business trends in the near term is closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of lockdowns in the market. For example, markets like Western Europe, which had high levels of restrictions and a meaningful away-from-home exposures; and India, which had an intense lockdown, experienced significant impacts. However, many of our Latin American markets with less restrictive measures and a lower away-from-home presence fared better. Further, as we went through the quarter and restrictions generally eased globally, our business saw improvements, from the 25% volume decline in April to the single-digit declines we are seeing now in July.","Business

KO,2020,2,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"The lockdowns also affected our share performance in the quarter. Our underlying performance in NARTD was positive and benefited from strong share gains in the at-home channel. However, this was entirely offset by a full point of negative channel mix due to the away-from-home pressure where we have strong shares. And as on-premise begins to revive, we fully expect to return to share growth, and we are already seeing sequential improvements in monthly trends.","Lockdown

In China, we placed a big emphasis on our sparkling portfolio during the height of the lockdown. And as a result, the category grew 14% in volume this quarter, led by trademark Coke, with strong growth in zero-sugar offerings.

So in the case of a brand like Odwalla and its chilled direct store delivery, which has struggled over the last several years, we started to stop operations effective July the 31st.

I'd like to spend my time this morning focused on three things: one, some commentary on the quarter and the rest-of-year outlook; two, thoughts on the broader and longer-term implications to value creation for our company and our system; and finally, on our capital allocation priorities. As expected, our second quarter was one with significant hurdles to overcome as lockdown and social distancing requirements placed profound pressures on our customers and consumers. In the second quarter, volumes were down 16%, driven by declines in higher revenue per case away-from-home channels.","Quarterly Outlook,
Long-term Implications, Capital Allocation Priorities, Customer Pressures, Volume Declines",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2020,2,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Organic revenues declined 26%, driven by a 22% decline in concentrate shipments and a 4% decline in price/mix. The gap between concentrate shipments and unit cases this quarter is attributable to cycling the timing of shipments from last year, primarily in EMEA and Latin America, along with rationalization of stock levels after some safety stock-building in the first quarter. The majority of the price/mix pressure during the quarter was driven by segment mix from meaningful declines in our cost of business in Global Ventures, as well as Bottling Investments. Underlying gross margin was down approximately 300 basis points, primarily driven by volume declines in capital-intensive finished goods businesses like Costa, food service in North America, and our Bottling Investments in addition to negative package and channel mix pressure.","Organic Revenues,
Concentrate Shipments, Price/Mix, Gross Margin, Volume Declines",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2020,2,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Despite the significant pressure on top line and gross margin, in addition to the currency headwinds, comparable operating margins were only slightly lower than last year given the effective management of our SG&A expenses. While we had a considerable amount of leverage during the quarter from cost management, part of it is attributable to timing due to modifying our full-year marketing spend forecast, which included an adjustment from the first quarter. As we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to hold off on providing full-year guidance, given the amount of uncertainty that remains. That said, there are some factors worth highlighting as you think about the second half.","Top Line, Gross
Margin, SG&A Expenses, Marketing Spend, Uncertainty",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2020,2,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"While we believe the second quarter will be the most severely impacted, we do expect the top-line trajectory to continue to correlate closely to the level of mobility of consumers and the health of the away-from-home channels, as James discussed earlier. The pandemic is not behind us. There is still good reason to be cautious as global COVID infections continue to increase, with case growth generally shifting from developed to emerging markets. While we are seeing sequential improvement, recovery will likely not to be linear.","Top-line Trajectory,

KO,2020,2,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"Some markets that were recovering are having a second spike in cases like we're seeing in Iran, Australia, Romania and here in the United States. Depending on the trajectory of recovery in away-from-home, channel and package mix will continue to put pressure on our gross margin. At the same time, while we do expect continued cost savings in the back half, the amount of leverage should moderate as we look to accelerate our marketing investments, given improving ROI characteristics in a number of markets. I'd also add that if the top line improves faster than expectations, we are prepared to reinvest more aggressively to further strengthen our position heading into 2021.","Markets with Second

KO,2020,2,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer,"And finally, moving to below the line, in an effort to extend the duration of our outstanding debt, in the first half, we issued $11.5 billion of long-term maturities, resulting in higher interest expense. While we firmly believe this is the right thing to do longer term, you will continue to see a year-over-year increase in interest expense in the back half of the year. James laid out the approach we are taking on the portfolio, innovation, marketing, execution and system efficiencies to return our company to top-line growth at the high end of our growth algorithm. We believe strongly in our future being propelled by top-line growth, but we also appreciate the top line must ultimately create value that meets or exceeds our shareholder expectations.","Long-term Maturities,

KO,2020,1,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"The first quarter began with good momentum coming off strong results in 2019. We were successfully executing our long-term strategy. Through February, we had solid broad-based strength across the globe with the exception of China where the progression of virus was already well ahead of the rest of the world. Looking at it, excluding China, our business is growing volumes 3%, and we will continue to gain value share. But as shelter at home and social distancing practices increased rapidly and globally, there has been temporary but profound pressure on our customers and our business.","First Quarter

KO,2020,1,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"The biggest impact has been a sharp decline in the important away-from-home portion of our business, which includes our eating and drinking channels as well as our on-the-go orientated channels like convenience retail. While our exposure varies across markets, away-from-home broadly represents about half of our business given our strong share positions. In some markets, like the US, drive-thru operations and carryout have helped offset some of the pressure, but most restaurants are operating on limited hours and are seeing overall trips decline sharply.","Away-From-Home

Then, as we get past the initial phase of the lockdown, however, we are seeing levels normalize. In other markets, like India, for example, the severity of the distancing measures has negatively impacted at-home as well, simply due to the significant reduction in shopping trips.

However, given the net effect of these shifts, we expect a temporary but significant impact on our business in the second quarter primarily coming from the slowdown in our away-from-home business. For context, if we look at our April month-to-date trends, we are seeing volumes down globally, approximately, 25% driven by the sharp declines in our away-from-home businesses.

The outbreak with its corresponding social distancing measures, a period of graduated reopenings, and finally, a return to a new normal.

As you'll have seen from our results today, we are pleased to report another quarter of strong performance, capping off a successful year in 2019. We delivered on our financial commitments for the year even in the face of stronger-than-expected currency headwinds. We see the right strategies taking hold, supported by the right partners, underpinned by a growing and vibrant industry, but we're just getting started. This is what gives us confidence in our 2020 outlook, and we are optimistic about the long-term opportunities in front of us. As regards to 2019, our business performed well. We gained value share globally in addition to gaining share in each of our geographic segments, achieving our largest share gain in almost a decade, with 34 of our top 40 markets gaining share. Organic revenue grew 6%, two points ahead of our initial forecast and at the top end of our long-term growth model. Top line growth was driven by strength across all the operating segments.

Comparable EPS grew 1%, at the top end of our guidance despite a higher-than-expected 8-point currency headwind. Finally, we delivered $10.5 billion in cash from operations, up 37% from prior year and well ahead of our initial guidance.

Organic revenue grew 3% for the year and while we continued to gain overall value share, too. Trademark Coca-Cola drove our performance with 4% retail value growth. Volumes in trademark Coke were positive for the second consecutive year, even as we continue to execute on our smaller pack initiatives. Across our refranchised North American bottling system, there is improved execution and continued conviction about the long-term growth opportunities for our business. Over the past few years, the system has invested nearly $0.75 billion to support our innovation and revenue growth management agenda. This includes expanding availability of our popular mini cans, which again grew in the double digits for the year. Latin America. Here we achieve 13% organic revenue growth, while navigating a tough macro environment by focusing on the fundamentals included expanding cooler placements, the acceleration of single serve packs and increasing availability of returnable packaging in under index markets. For example, in Brazil, we delivered the best performance we've seen in seven years, growing more than twice the rate of consumer spending. Our results were driven by high single-digit growth of single-serve packages, due in part to a more than 20% increase in cooler placements by our bottling partners.

KO,2019,4,James Quincey,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"The resilience of our Brazilian business helped deliver solid results in Latin America despite markets such as Argentina, where the economic situation continued to deteriorate during the year. In EMEA, organic revenue growth of 5% was balanced between solid industry growth and strong share gains. Growth was driven by strong results across developed, developing and emerging markets while innovations with Coca-Cola led to the best performance we've seen in the last eight years for the trademark. Our innovation with iconic brands also went beyond Trademark Coca-Cola. Schweppes grew double digits during the year, boosted by our new adult/mixer offerings. Fuze Tea continued to perform well across the group, now fully lapping its 37-market rollout in January of 2018. We have strong plans in place for the brand heading into 2020 focused on new winter flavors and no sugar antioxidant-infused offerings.These results led to the strongest share gains we've seen in years across the region, supported both by sparkling and non-sparkling gains. Turning to Asia. A concerted effort to recruit new consumers and drive horizontal expansion helped deliver 5% organic revenue growth for the year. Across Asia, we added 1.4 million new customer outlets, led by our two largest markets in the region, China and India. Our success in China is not just solely based on increased distribution. In order to help expand the consumer base, we've been adapting to the new digital-first consumer landscape. For example, we launched an integrated Coke and meal campaign with a heavy focus on online food aggregators. This helped us recruit more than 20 million new consumers, boosting our share of online meal ordering to over 60%.","Resilience, Latin America,

I've also been encouraged by the system's response in markets where we face challenges. In Japan, For example, the system moved quickly to rebuild production capacity, following natural disasters in 2018 and stepped up execution performance in order to support our innovation pipeline across the globe. We've seen that a constant focus on innovation revenue growth management and improved execution, all supported by integrated band building forms the foundation to live a strong results today and in the years ahead. Although we have much room to improve. I'm pleased with the progress we've made across these areas during the year. On innovation, we've leveraged the strength of our flagship brand while continuing to innovate across the total portfolio. Coke with coffee, launched in 35 additional markets in 2019, is satisfying a new occasion and recruiting consumers back into the brand, driving incremental sales for Coca-Cola Trademark. We've also launched Coke Energy in select international markets. And while we've seen some success with the initial rollout, we'll continue to learn how to enhance the consumer proposition as we expand further into 2020, including our recent rollout in the U.S., that tastes a little more like Coke.

We look to continue accelerating our innovation pipeline in 2020. And just touching on North America, our innovation plans include the launch of AHA sparkling water in March with a distinctive edge in the sparkling water space as two flavor offerings contain caffeine for a little morning or afternoon pick-me-up. We're innovating within our sports drink portfolio as well, with the rollout of POWERADE ULTRA, a breakthrough innovation for the sports drink category with cutting-edge ingredients, including creatine and more electrolytes than original POWERADE. We're also expanding our capabilities through the recent acquisition of fairlife, giving us a strong position in the fast-growing, value-added dairy space. We've also taken several steps in the ongoing evolution of our revenue growth management agenda.

This kind of collaboration helps drive results, leveraging the power of our consumer insights to support growth for us, our bottling partners and our customers. It's another example of how we create shared value for all who touch the Coca-Cola business. And we're still in the early stages of building out these capabilities and see this as a source of growth for a long time to come. In the end, ultimately though, it comes down to execution, as you can have a fantastic brand, a compelling consumer proposition, but it must be available at the right place at the right time. And execution continues to be based on the fundamentals. For example, in the Philippines, through the placement of more than 10,000 coolers and a 23-point increase in order fulfillment rates, we achieved double-digit volume growth for the year, along with our highest availability coverage and market share in seven years. To support our growth agenda, we've always been clear that M&A serves as an enabler to our strategy rather than a strategy in of itself. During 2019, we acquired Costa Coffee, which provides us a platform to create a world-class global coffee business. And we're moving with speed to build a strong foundation for long-term value creation under that brand.

And we're working closely with our bottling partners to accelerate the total Costa platform in 2020. While I'm proud of our team in delivering strong results, I'm equally proud of the work we are doing to build a sustainable business for the future. Our initiatives address water stewardship, sugar reduction, women's empowerment and climate. And I'll focus here on our World Without Waste initiative, which includes a number of goals to reduce packaging waste. We've made steady progress. For example, bottles made with 100% recycled PET are now available in 12 markets with more planned for 2020. Coca-Cola Sweden announced it will be the first market in the world to transition to 100% rPET, 100% recycled PET for all plastic bottles made in the country, a fully circular economy. In 2019, in Western Europe, we used nearly 30% recycled plastic across our total portfolio of PET bottles and are accelerating fast in line with supply. By the end of the year, we project to reach 40% recycled plastics in our bottles in Western Europe, targeting 50% by 2023 and working to increase the recycled content steadily thereafter. Within our flagship U.S. market, we teamed with partners and large competitors to launch Every Bottle Back program, which is designed to improve sorting, processing and collection in areas with the biggest infrastructure gaps. This will help increase the amount of recycled plastic available to be remade into beverage bottles. Speaking more broadly, we are preparing our system for the future with a flexible packaging portfolio.","Sustainability, Initiatives,

Press Release covered a fourth quarter results in detail picture we saw another quarter of solid results with 7% top line growth, translating into double digit operating income growth factor in timing of shipments. And the extra day in the quarter, the top line is closer to a 6%. net of these factors in line with our full year, top line results that I will focus. Some of the progress we've been making on our priorities. While is on our 2020 guidance. On the top line, we continue to see a strong response from the strategic actions we've been taking, now in the second year of delivering at the mid to high end of our long-term growth algorithm with contribution from both volume and price/mix. Delivering quality top line growth is translating into underlying margin expansion and profit growth. For 2019, we achieved underlying operating margin expansion of 150 basis points driven by top line acceleration and leveraging our cost base through productivity initiatives. We expanded margins even as we accelerated reinvestments in the business, helping us to drive double-digit profit growth on a currency-neutral basis. Comparable operating margin compressed by approximately 100 basis points as underlying expansion was more than offset by a combined approximate 250 basis point headwind from currency and acquisitions.","Growth,

KO,2019,4,John Murphy,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Free cash flow has been a particular area of focus this past year, enabling us to deliver $8.4 billion during the year, up 38% from the prior year and well ahead of our plan. We achieved this through accelerating our underlying performance, capturing working capital initiatives, a reduction in productivity and reinvestment costs and more disciplined use of our capital spend. Our progress on cash is a good example of when the organization is clear on the opportunity and the drivers to achieve it. And as we've seen, the results can sometimes exceed even our own expectations. Turning to the 2020 outlook. Based on the progress we've been making and the plans we have in place, we expect to achieve results well within our long-term growth targets for revenue, profit and earnings per share for 2020. importantly, we expect to deliver meaningful U.S. dollar EPS growth. Specifically, we expect organic growth -- organic revenue growth of approximately 5% and comparable currency-neutral operating income growth of approximately 8%. Key drivers of our operational outlook center around our continued focus on innovation, revenue growth management and improved execution, all supported by a comprehensive approach to brand building. James highlighted a few aspects of the innovation pipeline, and we continue to get sharper on how to better connect our revenue growth management initiatives into an integrated execution strategy in the marketplace that delivers on both the top and the bottom line. From a macro perspective, although volatility remains in certain spots around the world, we do expect consumer spending to remain healthy for 2020 and expect the emerging and developing world to outpace developed markets similar to 2019.","Cash Flow,
Growth, Innovation, Execution, Macro Perspective",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2019,4,John Murphy,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"In terms of currency, based on the latest rates, our hedged positions and our forecasted business mix, we anticipate a zero to one point headwind on revenue and a 2- to 3-point headwind at operating income. These headwinds are inclusive of cycling any hedging gains in 2019, which, as noted in the past, were minimal. Considering these factors, we expect comparable earnings per share of approximately $2.25 for 2020, a 7% increase from the prior year. We also expect to generate approximately $8 billion of free cash flow for 2020 through $10 billion in cash from operations and $2 billion in capital investments. Cash generation will be driven by continued strong underlying performance, capturing further working capital benefits, further reduction in productivity and reinvestment costs and even more disciplined use of capital spend.","Currency

KO,2019,4,John Murphy,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We remain consistent on our disciplined capital allocation program, which balances financial flexibility with efficient capital structure. Specifically, we'll continue to invest -- reinvest the cash generated to support our growth agenda. We'll also continue to return cash to shareowners by growing the dividend. And after investing for growth and delivering on our dividend commitments, we intend to use the excess cash to repurchase shares over time. My last point to cover is timing considerations for our 2020 outlook as we expect the majority of growth to occur in the back half of the year. The two biggest factors are: First, we have one less day in the first quarter and two additional days in the fourth quarter. And second, we will be cycling the impact from our European bottlers increasing their safety stock in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit earlier in 2019. This was a benefit to revenue growth in the first quarter of 2019 and then was subsequently reversed in the fourth quarter. The cycling effect will create a natural headwind for the first quarter of 2020 and a tailwind in the fourth quarter. So in summary, we are pleased with our 2019 results and confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments for 2020. We're also very clear on the direction we are heading as a system and well equipped to execute on the strategies to get us there. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Capital Allocation,

We're taking a close look at all assets on our balance sheet. For example, we're in the process of selling our building in New York and we recently divested our equity stake in our Peruvian bottler.

So after normalizing for the timing benefit, the best way to think about our underlying top line performance for the first half is 5%. Considering this strong performance, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue to 5% for the full year, which is translating into stronger underlying profit performance and that better underlying performance is enabling us to maintain our full-year comparable EPS guidance even as currencies have gotten worse and structural changes are less of a benefit when we expect this at the beginning of the year.","Organic

Since CAGNY, we've taken a close look at how we manage foreign exchange in over 70 functional currencies.

Ultimately, we'll focus on what we can control, taking steps to manage the business as we become a total beverage company: further lifting, shifting and scaling on-trend brands like Fuze Tea, smartwater and Innocent across markets; reformulating products to reduce sugar levels; rolling out revenue growth initiatives across additional territories to improve performance within our sparkling soft drink portfolio; connecting Costa across many of our business units to build a leading global coffee business; and leveraging digitization to build a business for the future.","Uncertainty,

We expect global growth to be slightly lower than in 2018, with continued growth in the developed world and macroeconomic challenges in certain emerging markets.

KO,2018,4,John Murphy,Incoming Chief Financial Officer,"We expect organic revenue growth to benefit from our continued focus on lifting, shifting and scaling products, such as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Fuze Tea, as well as implementing revenue growth management activities across more markets. In addition to solid organic growth, we expect an eight to nine-point benefit to revenue from net M&A and structural activity. We completed our North American franchising efforts and divested our company-owned bottlers in Uruguay and Guatemala last year.

KO,2018,4,John Murphy,Incoming Chief Financial Officer,"And earlier this year, we closed the acquisitions of both Costa Coffee and the remaining stake in Chi, Africa's leading value-added dairy and juice company. We expect the net effect of these transactions to result in lower comparable gross margins for the year, driven by the Philippines bottling operations. In the U.S., while freight costs are expected to remain above historical levels, we do not expect to see the same level of year-over-year increases we saw last year.

KO,2018,4,John Murphy,Incoming Chief Financial Officer,"A portion of these savings will be reinvested in the business. Recent investments are generating a good return, as evidenced by our strong top line relative to most CPG peers. So all-in, we expect solid pricing, a continued focus on expense management and a net benefit from acquisitions to deliver 10% to 11% comparable currency-neutral operating income growth. We expect currency to be a 6% to 7% headwind to operating income as we face a strengthened dollar and cycle hedging gains in 2018.","Pricing,
Expense Management, Acquisitions, Currency Headwind, Operating Income Growth",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2018,4,John Murphy,Incoming Chief Financial Officer,"Below the line, we expect deleverage, driven by higher net interest expense. And we expect an effective tax rate of 19.5%. However, this rate could vary from quarter to quarter. So in summary, we expect double-digit comparable currency-neutral operating income growth, but the impact of currency, along with higher income and taxes, will lead to the stated range of plus 1% to minus 1% for comparable EPS growth in 2019.","Deleverage,
Net Interest Expense, Effective Tax Rate, Comparable EPS Growth, Currency Impact",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2018,4,John Murphy,Incoming Chief Financial Officer,"As you model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of phasing. The first quarter will have one less day than in 2018. Easter will fall in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year. Due to the timing of Fed rate increases, the year-over-year increase in interest expense will be more heavily skewed to the first half of 2019 than the back half.","Phasing,
Easter Timing, Interest Expense Skew, First Half vs Back Half",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2018,4,John Murphy,Incoming Chief Financial Officer,"And similarly, because of when the dollar strengthened last year, we expect a more significant currency headwind in early 2019, which will then begin to moderate as we move through the year. As James said, we created a new operating group, Global Ventures. This will be a new reporting segment in 2019 and will include Costa Coffee, Dogadan Tea, Innocent and Monster.

However, there are times when we need or want to look externally and leverage M&A to drive our total beverage portfolio.

During my tenure with the company, I've seen our business evolving growth from a sparkling beverage company with three principal brands to a total beverage company with numerous billion-dollar brands that span across all beverage categories. It is also been a pleasure working for first Muhtar and now James. I'm excited for the future of the company. We have a great leadership team that will continue to build on and execute the company's strategy, and I'm particularly excited about the incoming CFO, John Murphy. John's experience and capabilities will allow him to be a great partner to James and a great leader for the finance organization.

KO,2018,3,Kathy Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"So now, turning to our performance in the quarter. As James mentioned, we saw a strong underlying growth, building on a solid first half. We delivered 6% organic revenue growth, driven by 4% concentrate shipments and 2% price mix. Concentrate shipments outpaced unit case volume growth by 2 points in the quarter. This is due largely to Brazilian bottlers building inventory as a precaution to any further supply disruptions in the country around the Presidential Elections and ahead of changes in local tax regulation. We anticipate this inventory build will reverse in the fourth quarter as elections are now completed and the tax regulation has been phased in.","Growth,
Revenue, Shipments, Inventory, Tax Regulation",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2018,3,Kathy Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"The strong organic revenue growth combined with ongoing productivity measures and the timing of expenses drove 20% underlying operating income growth in the quarter. While the underlying results are strong as you know, our reported financials continue to be affected by accounting changes enacted at the beginning of this year and from cycling bottler refranchising activity from last year. Our comparable operating margin increased 575 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an approximate 130 basis point impact from new accounting standard and currencies.","Growth,
Operating Income, Margin, Accounting Changes, Currencies",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2018,3,Kathy Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"Productivity helped drive the roughly 400 basis point expansion in underlying operating margin with actions across all of our operating segments. However we saw a particular benefit in our North America and corporate segments due to lean enterprise initiative. The accounting impact and the change in revenue recognition was roughly in line with our expectations. It's important to note that the impact varied significantly by operating segment. For example, Latin America saw over a 400 basis point benefit in its margin while North American's margin was impacted by roughly 250 basis points. So I recognize that there are lot of moving parts, but if you would realize each of these effects, our underlying operating margins expanded about 400 basis points in the quarter and about 200 basis points for the year-to-date period.","Productivity, Operating Margin, Accounting Impact, Revenue Recognition, Segments",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2018,3,Kathy Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"Below the line, we benefited from a lower tax rate. In order to bring our year-to-date effective tax rate in line with our revised full-year expectation of 20.3%, we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the quarter. So all in, good operational performance coupled with a timing benefit and a lower effective tax rate resulted in comparable EPS of $0.58 in the quarter, up 14%, which includes an 8% unfavorable impact from currencies.","Tax

KO,2018,3,Kathy Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"So before turning to the fourth quarter, let me provide an update on bottler transactions. I'm happy to announce that with the sale of our company-owned bottler in Canada at the end of the third quarter, we have now completed our North America bottler refranchising process. We set ourselves up for the future with an energized bottling system that is bringing a renewed focus on their local market. In Asia, we expect to acquire 51% of our Philippines bottler for Coca-Cola FEMSA during the fourth quarter. This will become a part of our bottling Investment Group, which is now comprised primarily of South West and Southeast Asian bottler.","Bottler

KO,2018,3,Kathy Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"Now turning to the remainder of this year, considering our performance year-to-date and despite an increasingly challenging currency environment, we are maintaining our guidance on organic revenue and comparable EPS growth. Specifically, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of at least 4% and comparable EPS growth of 8% to 10%. However, there are two elements within the guidance that are changing and then as a third element that impacts phasing. While these balance together for the full year, due to the timing of each, they do result in a shift between quarters.","Growth,

Second, we now expect the sell CCBA, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in 2019 better than 2018. As such, a twopenny structural benefit that we expected to receive from this transaction will now shift on the fourth quarter '18 into our our 2019 earnings.","Inventory

KO,2018,3,Kathy Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"Third, we now expect an effective tax rate of 20.3% for the full year versus our original estimate of 21%. Now this will be a slight benefit to our fourth quarter earnings, it was a much larger benefit to our third quarter earnings. And this is because we needed to bring our year-to-date effective tax rate in line with our revised full-year expectation. So as such we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the third quarter. And taken together, these retained is representing $0.03 unfavorable impact to fourth-quarter earnings but the full year does not change.

We continue to expect to reinvest $1.7 billion in the business through capital expenditures and we will return free cash flow to shareowners through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and an expected $1 billion in net share repurchase. So in summary, we delivered solid financial performance in both the quarter and year-to-date period.

KO,2018,2,James Quincey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying and underlining that we're winning in a dynamic and vibrant industry. The global beverage industry is growing faster than last year, driven by better results in the emerging and developing markets, and also the sparkling soft drink category.

KO,2018,2,James Quincey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So, 2018 -- at the halfway mark of the year, we're seeing good momentum in our underlying business. Organic revenue is up 5% year to date, driven by a good mixture of volume and price mix, global volume is up 3%, which is the strongest we've seen in five years, and comparable EPS is up 5% year to date despite stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of 2018, and, as we noted at the start of the year, we've always expected EPS growth to be back-half weighted, and that has not changed.","Momentum,

KO,2018,2,James Quincey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So, operationally, looking around the world, we delivered strong top-line growth in the first half of the year, driven by continued strength in our international markets. In Asia-Pacific, strong performance in key emerging markets like China, India, and Vietnam drove mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment during the first half of the year. While we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio across all of our Asia markets, our sparkling soft drink portfolio led our top-line acceleration.","Strong Growth,

KO,2018,2,James Quincey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Turning to Latin America, even in the face of headwinds, we delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth for the first half as we focused on the fundamentals. Mexico continues to perform well, driven by solid growth across our sparkling and dairy portfolios. In Brazil, a ten-day transport strike in late May put a virtual halt to the economy. Prior to that, we were on track to deliver the third quarter of sequentially improving volume growth. Our system worked hard to recover momentum, and by the end of the quarter, we had bounced back to pre-strike growth rates.","Latin America,

Our no-sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio delivered 7% retail value growth in the quarter thanks to the recently restaged Diet Coke and strong growth of Coke Zero Sugar. Our hydration and coffee portfolios drove strong results as well. Powerade Zero, Dasani Sparkling, and our coffee portfolio each grew volume double digits.

KO,2018,2,James Quincey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Now, let me turn to the pricing environment in North America. Stepping back, the overall market remains disciplined, and we remain focused on executing revenue growth management initiatives to grow our price mix over time. However, as you can see, reported price mix in North America continued to differ from market-level performance. This was principally due to three factors. First, freight costs remain a challenge, were slightly worse than our initial forecasts, and as we noted in the first-quarter call, outbound freight costs are reported in price mix for 2018. Secondly, the timing of deductions, which net out in the year, between the second quarter and the third quarter put a point of pressure on price mix. Lastly, business mix put two points of pressure on reported price mix as our concentrated sparkling business grew faster than our finished goods business, particularly the juice and tea.","Pricing
Environment, Disciplined Market, Revenue Growth Management, Freight Costs, Business Mix",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2018,2,James Quincey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Combined, these factors put approximately four points of pressure on the reported price mix, driving the vast majority of the difference you see versus the growth in scanner data. We're taking pricing actions alongside our bottlers on our sparkling beverage brands and expect to see positive price mix in the second half across the portfolio in aggregate as our package downsizing and our marketplace pricing actions are fully implemented and the timing items reverse. These factors, along with the continued execution of our strategy, will result in stronger financial performance in North America in the back half. So, to summarize, our emerging and developing markets are accelerating with double-digit organic revenue growth year to date and our developed markets are performing well, delivering low single-digit organic revenue growth.","Reported Price

KO,2018,2,James Quincey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Now, turning and talking a little bit about how we're driving disciplined, sustainable growth in the business. Obviously, first, it requires a solid understanding of the consumer to build the right portfolio in each market. Over the last few calls, we've discussed how we're expanding our portfolio through innovations, acquisitions, and lifting, shifting, and scaling successful brands across markets. But, disciplined growth also requires that our existing brands retain and sharpen their edge by connecting better with consumers' needs.

Craftsman's drinks come in premium, glass-like PET bottles that are resealable, making them portable and easier to consume.

Earlier this year, our Middle East and North Africa business unit identified more than 125 underperforming SKUs to eliminate. To date, we've discontinued 60% of those and intend to delist the rest by the end of the year, allowing us to reallocate resources to brands and strategic initiatives that are delivering the highest return.

We're also constantly focusing our teams on the work that matters most: Driving a productivity mindset in the business with the aim of both funding reinvestment and driving cash flow improvements. For example, after a recent review, we've significantly reduced the number of strategic projects in one of our largest business units to ensure that we're sufficiently allocating resources to the highest-return-on-investment projects rather than targeting too many actions at once. This is building on the previous productivity actions we've laid out and helping us to drive strong 8% underlying operating income growth for the first half of the year while continuing to reinvest behind our brands.

For example, trademark Coca-Cola led the way, growing volume a healthy 4% globally, due to improving trends in our developing and emerging markets along with strong momentum in our low- and no-calorie variants. In North America, organic revenue grew 1% as stronger volume growth was partially offset by 1% decline in price mix. We delivered solid performance in the marketplace, gaining value share. Innovation across our multiple category clusters, including sparkling and our Zero Sugar portfolio drove strong consumer uptake. North American price mix declined 1% as positive low-single digit underlaying pricing was offset by a few factors, which Kathy will walk you through. Given the change in reported price mix, I wanna be clear. Our pricing strategy has not changed.","Revenue Growth,

And since then, we've seen retail pricing accelerate. We remain committed to take the actions needed to earn price and value in the marketplace. And we expect to achieve low-single digit price mix for our total beverage portfolio in North America again this year. Now looking at markets outside of North America, Europe delivered strong organic revenue growth as we launched new products like FUZE Tea while continuing to drive revenue growth management initiatives. China and India accelerated top-line growth in the quarter. And we also saw better performance in some of the markets that have been struggling, notably Brazil and Argentina.

To meet these desires, we are shaping and expanding our portfolio through innovation, expansion of the lift, shift, and scale model, and bolt-on M&A all being driven by a disciplined approach to growth. For example, the global ready to drink tea category represents $60 billion in retail value, and it's projected to continue growing solidly as consumers seek out more natural beverage choices that can deliver functional benefits. Our tea portfolio has grown over the past several years, chiefly behind the strength of three large brands: FUZE Tea, Ayataka, and Gold Peak, as well as strong local and regional brands such as Honest Tea. Earlier, I mentioned the launch of FUZE Tea in Europe. At the end of last year, FUZE Tea was available in almost 50 countries, but had not yet been launched in Europe.","Beverage Choices,

With this expansion, we have effectively doubled the value of the FUZE Tea brand globally. This is a great example of how we can rapidly lift and shift proven successful brands and scale them quickly. We are also working to scale high growth brands we've acquired. Last October, we acquired the US rights to Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water from Mexico, with the intent of using our Venturing and Emerging Brands unit as an incubator to guide the expansion of the brand's distributional footprint.

We introduced new packaging, a new marketing campaign, and new flavors designed to appeal to the next generation of consumers. We got off to a strong start, returning Diet Coke to growth in North America. Now we recognize it's still very early in the process, but we are encouraged by the initial consumer response.

KO,2018,1,Kathy N. Waller,"The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid, underlaying financial results slightly ahead of our expectations due to the timing of shipments, with 5% organic revenue growth and operating expense leverage driving 9% growth in underlaying operating income. This translated into strong comparable EPS growth of 8%. And based on where we stand today, we remain confident that we can deliver our full-year guidance of 4% organic revenue growth and 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth. Today, I'll cover three topics: Price mix, our comparable results, and our outlook. Starting with price mix, as James mentioned, our consolidated price mix trended lower than our recent run rate, largely due to timing as well as a few factors impacting North America during the quarter. However, as we move through the year, we expect the timing factors to reverse into a net benefit and for the pressure in North America to moderate, resulting in stronger global price mix.","Price Mix,
Comparable Results, Outlook, North America, Global Performance",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2018,1,Kathy N. Waller,"The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","In North America, price mix during the quarter was unfavorably impacted by the timing of new product launches, incremental outbound freight costs, and the shift of the Easter holiday. Like other CPG companies, we faced significant freight headwinds in North America this year. Historically, we have accounted for the cost of outbound freight as a reduction from revenue. Therefore, it impacts our price mix calculations. We estimate that this will be a one-point impact on North America's full-year price mix. It will be more frontloaded due to the timing of when freight costs again increasing last year. Outside of North America, emerging and developing markets outpaced developed markets in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA operating group, impacting price mix at the group level. However, at the local level, we generated positive price mix in most of our markets.","North America, Price
Mix, Freight Costs, Emerging Markets, Developed Markets",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2018,1,Kathy N. Waller,"The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And in Latin America, we continue to benefit from strong price mix in our Mexico and South Latin business units while operating in an overall low inflationary environment. Turning to our comparable financial performance in the quarter, as I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, there are two factors creating noise in our comparable financial performance this year with varying impacts by quarter and by operating segment. So first, structural. We expect comparable revenue and operating income to decline on an absolute basis, the growth in operating margins to improve as we cycle exiting lower margin, capital intensive businesses last year. Second, as we mentioned on the fourth quarter call, two new accounting standards went into effect this quarter. The first requires companies to split out net tension expense, keeping the service cost in SG&A and moving the other components of tension expense to other income. So, in accordance, we issued reclassified 2017 quarterly and full-year financial information on April 3rd.","Latin America, Price
Mix, Comparable Financial Performance, Structural Growth, New Accounting Standards",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2018,1,Kathy N. Waller,"The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And that continued at comparable. The second pertains to revenue recognition. The primary impact this quarter that certain revenue and costs and contracts that were previously netted together in revenue are now growth up into their revenue and [inaudible] components. We expect this will result in higher growth in both comparable net revenue and cost of goods sold with no material impact to gross profit or operating income for the full year. However, this will mathematically affect the calculation of gross and operating margin. An example is outbound freight, which is now, after the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard, accounted for as part of cost of goods sold. As I said earlier, this was previously recorded as a reduction to revenue. The price to the customer includes outbound freight. However, we applied this accounting change to effect that did not restate our historical financial statement.","Revenue Recognition,

KO,2018,1,Kathy N. Waller,"The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Therefore, in organic revenue, we have adjusted for that change to make our 2018 quarterly results comparable to the 2017 comparative period. As a result, both our organic revenue growth and price mix will continue to be impacted by the outbound freight costs this year. So, looking at our performance in the quarter, comparable net revenue declined as organic revenue growth and benefits in the new accounting standard and currency tailwind were more than offset by a 26% structural impact from cycling bottler refranchising last year. However, comparable operating margin increased 600 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlaying performance partially offset by an almost 100 basis point impact from the new accounting standard. Below the line, higher net interest expense offset higher other income and equity income in the quarter. And a lower effective tax rate and net share repurposes contributed to comparable EPS of $0.47, up 8% in the quarter.","Organic Revenue

KO,2018,1,Kathy N. Waller,"The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Finally, we generated approximately $340 million in free cash flow, up 5%, driven by reduced capital investment needs as we divest bottling operations, partially offset by the impact of one less day in the quarter. Now looking at the remainder of the year, our full-year guidance remains intact. 4% organic revenue growth, 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth, and at least $8.5 billion in cash from operations. As we model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of savings. Consistent with what we said on the fourth quarter call, we still expect full-year EPS growth to be driven by the second half of the year, primarily due to the timing of expenses and productivity initiatives. Also, in the first quarter, concentrate shipments outpaced unit case volume growth, particularly in our EMEA operating segment. This pulled some revenue and profit into the first quarter. As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect this to normalize with full-year concentrate shipments running in line with unit case volume growth.","Free Cash Flow,

KO,2018,1,Kathy N. Waller,"The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Now there are also a few things to consider specific to the second quarter. We are adapting to new sugar excess taxes in both the UK and South Africa while cycling strong results from Western Europe last year. While we feel confident in our strategies and ability to adapt our portfolio to the new operating environment, we expect some level of impact, particularly as consumers first adjust to the new prices. And we are cycling a low SG&A base last year due to the timing of expenses. From a non-operational perspective, we expect a four- to five-point headwind from structural items and a one-point headwind from currencies on operating income. And we expect the change in revenue recognition to be a one- to two-point tailwind to revenue.

We are currently evaluating it and expect our system to accelerating investments to capture further opportunities. The tax reform also eliminates a long-standing distortion due to the former US worldwide tax system, which will make it easier for our company to manage its cash and debt balances.

As James said, 2017 was a good year as we met or exceeded our financial guidance during significant change at the company.

KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"Starting with the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while I won't touch on every element, I think there are three important factors to review: the impact of our underlying effective tax rate, the tax liability on our foreign accumulated earnings, and capital structure implication.","Tax Cuts, Effective
Tax Rate, Foreign Earnings, Capital Structure",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"First, based on our expected earnings split between US and international locations, we estimate this will lower our global effective tax rate to approximately 21% in 2018 compared to our 24% rate in 2017 and our previously expected 2018 tax rate of 26%. However, we expect increased variability from quarter to quarter as future interpretations of the law and updates to the related accounting guidance could have an impact on our effective tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Therefore, the 21% effective tax rate estimate is just that, an estimate, and will be subject to change. As we go through the year, we will update you on any potential changes.","Tax Rate, Effective

KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"Second, in the fourth quarter, we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $3.6 billion associated with the enactment. The charge encompasses several elements including a one-time $4.6 billion tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a primarily offsetting net deferred tax benefit of $1 billion. Despite being recorded in the fourth quarter, the one-time tax will be paid over an eight-year period as stipulated by the act. So, the cash flow impacts from the $4.6 billion charge will fall in future periods but will be more than offset by the accumulated cash benefit from the lower ongoing tax rate after a six to seven year payback period.","Tax, Foreign
Earnings, Non-Cash Charge, Cash Flow, Payback Period",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"While the accumulated impact is a benefit to free cash flow, the tax payments impact the company's free cash flow conversion target over the next years. At our investor day last November, we introduced a free cash flow conversion target of 95% to 100% of GAAP net income adjusted to exclude noncash items impacting comparability. While the lower effective tax rate will benefit both earnings and cash flow by the same amount, the tax on historical foreign earnings will only impact our free cash flow. So, this has the mathematical effect of lowering our free cash flow conversion. Since the impact of tax reform was not anticipated when we provided the guidance during our investor day, we are not adjusting our target to 90% to 95% during this eight-year period of tax payments.","Tax, Free Cash Flow,

As a result, we are providing a few updates to our capital structure. First, we have a target of 2 to 2.5 times net debt leverage as we believe this provides the right balance between reaching the optimal capital structure and persevering financial flexibility as we move forward on strategic initiatives.

This will allow us to reduce the spread between our growth and net debt level, support our credit rating, and continue to access the commercial paper market and reduce our net interest expense. The remaining cash will continue to be invested overseas as a significant portion of it is non-remittable because of local regulations or is required for working capital purposes. Another portion is required to support our commercial paper program, and then some of the cash is earning a good return in certain overseas markets. And, finally, our cash priorities remain the same.

While there are various considerations, the primary impact will be that certain revenue and costs and contracts that were previously netted together in revenue will now be grossed up into their revenue and cost of goods sold components going forward.","Revenue Recognition,
Accounting Standards Update, Contracts, Grossing Up, Netting",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"Further, as this change is prospective, meaning there's no restatement of prior results, this will result in an estimated increase in net revenue growth of 1% to 2% and an increase of 3% to 5% in cost of goods sold in 2018. Importantly, there is no material impact to our consolidated profit or EPS as a result. However, the math of this accounting change does result in operating margin compression. This change impacts the operating segments in different ways and causes a timing different, which impacts the quarter. Supplementary materials with additional details on the impact to our operating segments and our quarters are filed on our website, and our investor relations team can cover any additional questions with you.","Net Revenue Growth,

KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"The FASB also issued an accounting standards update on pensions and post-retirement benefit costs, which requires companies to split out net pension expense keeping the service cost and S&GA and moving the other components of pension expense to other income. As this is simply a reclass of the P&L, there is no impact to profit before tax or EPS. However, there is an impact to operating margin. Taking these two accounting changes together, we expect approximately 150 basis points of operating margin compression going forward.","Pension Expense,

KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to full year 2018 expected performance, we expect organic revenue growth to accelerate to 4%. We expect comparable EPS to grow 8% to 10% with the majority of earnings growth coming from the second half of the year. And we expect cash from operations of at least $8.5 billion. This represents over a 20% rebound as certain cash costs associated with refranchising activity and with the restructuring of the organization in 2017. We will continue to follow our capital allocation priorities starting with an expected $1.9 billion on capital investment. This is higher than our long-term expected spend due to investments we are making in 2018 to enhance digital capability. And we will return our free cash flow this year through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and approximately $1 billion in net share repurchases. As announced yesterday, our board increased the dividends for the 56th year in a row to an annual equivalent to $1.56 per share up 5% from $1.48.","Organic Revenue

We expect continued portfolio lift and shift initiatives, such as Coca-Coal Zero Sugar and Fuze Tea, strong marketplace execution like we've seen in EMIR and a slightly improving macro outlook to result in stronger, topline growth. Along with some improvement in the emerging markets, we see commodity prices rising. However, continued solid pricing and a focus on expense management will more than offset higher raw material cost. As such, we expect to deliver 8% to 9% underlying operating income growth.","Topline Growth,

KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"As mentioned previously, the accounting change for customer contracts will result in a 1% to 2% point tailwind to net revenue and a 3% to 5% point increase to cost of goods sold with a minimal effect on operating income. The pension accounting change will require a restatement to our 2017 results, and given the amount of the reclass, we do not expect it to impact our 2018 guidance on operating income.","Net Revenue, Cost of
Goods Sold, Operating Income, Pension Accounting Change, Restatement",Coca-Cola Company
KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to structural items, we will continue to see a structural headwind in 2018 primarily due to the timing of when certain bottling operations were sold last year and the planned refranchising of bottling territories in Canada this year. Therefore, for 2018, we expect a 17% headwind to revenue, and 2% headwind to operating income from structural items.","Structural Headwind,

KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"This will result, however, in an approximate 500 basis point benefit to comparable operating margins on top of solid underlying margin expansion in the core business. We expect currency to be a 0% to 1% headwind to operating income as improving spot rates will be offset if we cycle hedging gains from 2017. Below the line, we expect modest deleverage.

KO,2017,4,Kathy N. Waller,Chief Financial Officer,"These factors, along with our updated 21% effective tax rate, will lead to expected growth in comparable EPS of 8% to 10% in 2018. As we model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of phasing for the year. We expect earnings growth to be back-half weighted primarily due to the timing of expenses and productivity initiatives. Moving specifically to the first quarter, the first quarter will have one less day than the prior year first quarter. We expect a 6 point headwind from structural items and a one-point tailwind from currencies on operating income.

In addition to visiting stores and Sam's Clubs in the US this quarter, I also got to visit stores with the Canadian leadership team in the Toronto market. It was a reminder that our associates around the world have served others throughout this pandemic with courage and resilience. Our Canadian stores had some great items for Diwali, we sold through Halloween well. In the seasonal areas, we're ready for Christmas. In the US, we're ready for the holidays too. There is a level of excitement in the year. You can feel it. I've been walking away from these stores with the recurring thought. We're ready. We have the people, the products and the prices to deliver a great holiday season.

Walmart US drove a sequential acceleration in comp sales both on a one and two-year basis, and continued to gain market share in grocery. Sam's Club had another very strong quarter, as did Walmart International, with China, Mexico and India leading the way.

In this latest cycle, the pandemic caused shifts in how customers and members shopped and what they purchased. The long period of sustained demand for goods has stretched supply chains, resulting in out-of-stocks and inflation. Fighting inflation is in our DNA. Sam Walton loves that fight and so do we. I want to thank our truck drivers, merchants, replenishment teams, our associates that move inventory through the supply chain and our suppliers. They're working together creatively and quickly.

WMT,2022,3,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The team is moving fast and being aggressive as we build the pieces of our flywheel. In the US, Walmart Go Local for last mile delivery is an example. We're excited to have the Home Depot join Walmart and Sam's Club to share our white label delivery as a service platform. This service is powered by our proprietary driver platform, Spark Driver. The technology behind it is now available in Mexico as we learn to build more digital products that can be leveraged globally. Spark continues to grow and is now active in 900 US cities, providing access to more than 50% of US households. And we're just getting started. We recently enabled a new feature within the Spark Driver app called shopping and delivery, which gives service providers the option to shop and deliver customers' orders. So, if delivery slots are full at a location, this feature allows us to serve that demand.

Globally, we continue to see rapid growth in advertising income led by the US, Flipkart and Mexico. We're also making good progress at PhonePe, and we're starting to ramp in Canada and Chile. Beyond advertising income, we're creating new ways to gather and analyze data to fuel smarter, faster decision-making to better serve customers, members and suppliers. Earlier this quarter, we launched Walmart Luminate in the US, which is a new suite of data products created for our merchants and suppliers to reveal actionable category and item inside.

WMT,2022,3,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Now let's move on to segment results. I'll begin with Walmart US. Comp sales of 9.2% or 15.6% on a two-year stack is remarkable growth. The gains we've seen in market share for grocery and strong back to school results indicate our inventory position has improved. Prices and assortment are compelling, and customers continue to move away from early pandemic behaviors. We see tailwinds in our results. A strong consumer, a degree of inflation and government stimulus are all factors. But I also like what I see in the core of the business. Transaction counts in our stores and clubs are growing; inventory is up 11.5%; our price gaps or where we want them; and we're innovating in the supply chain and adding capacity. And we're building businesses like Walmart Go Local, Walmart Connect, Walmart Luminate, Walmart Plus, Spark delivery, our Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services. Financial services is another area where we know we can make a difference in the lives of so many.

Growth in membership income of 11.3% is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Membership count reached a new record high during the quarter. And overall renewal rates were strong across the board, including first-year renewals and those for Plus members. Both individual and business members are shopping with us across channels and using the digital tools we've developed. The new Don't Forget function with Scan and Go is a great example. It's a completely digital way for us to help members and drive basket size at the same time. Based on a member's shopping history, we can target items that a member may be forgetting in their trip all through the app, and we already see an increase in the number of items in the basket.

Back to school and other fall celebrations helps drive traffic for us as families began to get back to normal shopping patterns. The festive season is off to a strong start with Big Billion Days in India. We continue to see strong growth in e-commerce. On a two-year stack, sales increased 91%, led by Flipkart and China. We've talked about the importance of omnichannel globally, and we continue to see the buildout of these models across markets.

WMT,2022,3,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Now let's discuss Q3 results. As a reminder, the previously announced international divestitures significantly affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments today will focus on the underlying business, excluding the effect of divestitures. Also COVID costs remained elevated globally, although lower than last year in most markets. In addition, EPS includes a $0.67 negative effect from premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. Total constant currency revenue grew more than 10% to over $139 billion. Walmart US comp sales momentum remained strong; up 15.6% on a two-year stack, due in part to strong US consumer spending and some inflation. Strength in China, Mexico and India led to international sales growth of more than 10% in constant currency. Strong trends at Sam's Club continued with comp growth of nearly 31% on a two-year stack, excluding fuel and tobacco. Currency benefited sales by about $1.3 billion. Gross margin rate declined 51 basis points due primarily to increased supply chain costs and headwinds from fuel mix in the US segments as well as format mix shifts in International. However, total gross margin dollars grew 9.6%. SG&A expenses leveraged 13 basis points, reflecting strong sales and lower COVID costs, partially offset by increased wage investments in the US. As a result of these investments, we've seen a great response to our holiday hiring programs, with the addition of over 200,000 new store and supply chain associates. Operating income on a constant currency basis was up 6.3%, leading to adjusted EPS of $1.45. As anticipated, free cash flow for the year is about $8 billion lower than last year, primarily reflecting inventory increases and higher capex. We repurchased $2.2 billion of stock in Q3 and $7.4 billion year-to-date, up significantly from last year. I'm pleased with the improvements in ROI, even as we've made strategic investments, with reported ROI increasing 80 basis points to 14.5%, which is among the best level in four years.","Revenue growth, International sales, Supply

Strong sales trends were led by grocery, health and wellness and apparel. Back to school categories also performed well, along with automotive and holiday decor. We're pleased with the strong momentum in the grocery business as our strong price positioning and omni offerings resonate with customers.

Lower markdowns and increased contributions from advertising revenue have helped offset cost pressures. SG&A expenses deleveraged 20 basis points due primarily to investments and wages. But operating income was strong, up almost 6%. Inventory increased 11.5% in preparation for what we expect to be a strong holiday season.

During the mid-autumn festival, sales were terrific and we saw an acceleration in omni performance with nearly all hypermarkets setting online sales records during this event. Flipkart had another good quarter, with strong sales growth and favorable trends in monthly active customers and users. In anticipation of the holiday season, the team has doubled fulfillment capacity versus last year, with dozens of new fulfillment center locations, more than 1,000 last mile delivery hubs, and expanded relationships with Toronto partners to handle a large percentage of last mile deliveries. Comp sales in Mexico increased 6% and grew faster than the market according to ANTAD, with strong consumer spending on categories related to back to school and seasonal celebrations. Customer adoption of omni offerings continue to grow, and we're seeing a strong response to the launch of Walmart Fulfillment Services with one-fourth of Marketplace sales fulfilled through this network. In Canada, comp sales were up 6% and increased more than 13% on a two-year stack. Seasonal sales events were especially strong and omni sales continued to increase. Online grocery is now available in nearly all stores, and we've launched Express pickup within two hours in a couple of stores in Toronto.

As the Delta variant spread and as the potential for future variants persists, we made the decision to require our U.S. teams, above store and club level, to become fully vaccinated by October 4.

Walmart U.S. adjusted operating income is expected to increase 11% to 13.5%. Full year adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.35.

We had strong performance in all three segments. As the pandemic continues, it's impacting the countries where we operate in different ways. So our teams are adapting to overcome the challenges and deliver the strong results we're sharing today.

WMT,2022,1,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"2021 brings its own unique challenges and uncertainty, but overall my optimism is higher than it was at the beginning of the year for several reasons. In the US, economic stimulus is clearly having an impact, but we also see encouraging signs that our customers want to get out and shop. Our execution is improving despite the hurdles presented by the pandemic. The second half will likely have more uncertainty than a normal year, but we like our position. Our stores are getting stronger and our e-commerce capabilities are expanding as we continue to grow. Customers will decide how and when they want to shop and they'll find us ready whether they want to shop in store, pick up an order or have it delivered.","Optimism,

WMT,2022,1,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Key elements of our strategy are coming together nicely. We saw an acceleration of traffic in our stores, gained market share in grocery, improved in-stock levels and grew e-commerce sales globally by 43% in constant currency, excluding recent divestitures.

We'll monitor our price gaps and adjust as appropriate with both customers and shareholders in mind. As it relates to COVID-19, the past several weeks have been more challenging in some countries. India, Canada, Chile and South Africa are priorities at the moment.

WMT,2022,1,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In India, we're donating oxygen concentrators, PPE and financial support. When it comes to helping people get vaccinated, we're engaged in multiple countries. In the US, we've administered millions of doses. We're taking steps to encourage our associates and everyone to become vaccinated. Given CDC guidance, our US associates that have been vaccinated can now work without a mask if they choose to, and we've added a cash incentive as one more step to encourage vaccinations. All of our Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies in the US are administering vaccines, and we can provide them without an appointment. We've also collaborated with national and local organizations to support more than 200 community events across the country so far. In India, we're facilitating vaccinations for our associates and their households and our Flipkart and PhonePe contractors, more 200,000 people. Across the countries where we operate, we'll keep looking for more places to make a difference. This pandemic won't be over until it's over for everyone.","India,

WMT,2022,1,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In addition to combating the pandemic, we also announced a new commitment to US manufacturing during the quarter. Over the next 10 years, we've set a goal to purchase an additional $350 billion on items made grown or assembled in the US. We estimate this commitment will create more than 750,000 new American jobs and avoid 100 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. We also want to make it easier for manufacturing in the US to flourish. That's why we're launching an initiative called American Light Houses. We'll bring together partners from the supplier community, academia and government, among other groups, to identify and overcome top-down barriers to US production.","Pandemic,

In collaboration with NGE North America, a power generator and services company, we're adding more than 500 MW to the US renewable grid through three separate wind projects. Together, these projects are expected to supply renewable energy to hundreds of stores, clubs and distribution facilities annually. That's enough renewable energy to power over 240,000 average American homes for a year. That's on top of the 4 gigawatts of renewable energy currently supplied by our projects globally.

WMT,2022,1,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Now let's talk more about our results for the quarter. Walmart US had another strong quarter. The team delivered for our customers as they shopped in our stores and online and additional government stimulus payments created a tailwind. Our comp sales of 6%, including 37% growth in e-commerce, were strong. Strength was broad based across categories, including apparel, home, hardlines and seasonal. I recently visited stores, clubs and supply chain facilities in New Jersey, Delaware, DC, Ohio, New Mexico, Texas, Illinois, California and Florida. I continue to be grateful for the job our associates are doing, and I'm impressed by their spirit. They're operating safely in a pandemic, improving our in-stock and standards, working hard to fulfill pickup and delivery orders and vaccinating millions. Doing all those things at once isn't easy, and we've had our challenges, but our associates continue to step up and they're strengthening our position as they do it.","Strong quarterly results, Walmart US, Customer shopping experience, Associate

WMT,2022,1,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In the US, our first-party retail business is strong, but we're also making good progress in other important parts of our business. Marketplace GMV, fulfillment services and advertising income with Walmart Connect are all strong. The flywheel we showed you in February is being built. Each component is positioning us to serve the customer better while diversifying the model. As we previously shared, the top of the flywheel starts with being the best first place people shop. Store remodels, investments in pickup and delivery capacity and sales of Walmart+ fall into this category of activities. We need more capacity to get ahead of demand, and we remain convinced these investments are smart ones. This is one of the keys to selling more Walmart+ memberships, which is an important piece of our strategy over time.","Strong US retail

We'll invest in our general merchandise business and grow in higher-margin categories. The announced acquisition of Zeekit is a great example. This start-up combines fashion and technology through a dynamic virtual fitting room and underscores the desire to grow our apparel business aggressively. We continue our work to build a larger health and wellness business and help customers and associates have a better experience when it comes to their healthcare.

WMT,2022,1,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Just as we're doing with core retail, we're building an omnichannel health and wellness business. At Sam's Club, the momentum continues. Our items are improving, membership and sales comps are strong and the team keeps adding and scaling capabilities like curbside. We're seeing strength in categories associated with social gatherings as well as an increase in business member activity. Categories like restaurant supplies are coming back. We saw a tremendous growth in membership income for the quarter, and overall, membership counts are at an all-time high.

As you'll recall, we recently divested our businesses in the UK, Japan and Argentina. And as a result, net sales for the quarter declined about 11% year-on-year. On a like-for-like basis, when we remove the recently divested markets, net sales increased 5.1%.

At Flipkart, monthly active customers and users are key metrics, and we're performing well. Our recent announcement of our intent to acquire Cleartrip, a leading online travel company, underscores our commitment to transform the customer experience through digital commerce. A growing base of customers means we need to continue to add new capabilities, including areas such as logistics and data storage.

Similar to the US, we're expanding our business to include more than just traditional retail. A few areas of note include the advertising business, which saw an increase of more than 100% in new advertisers, and our new mobile phone services network that provides voice, data and home broadband, bringing access and value to our customers.

We grew overall e-commerce sales 60% on top of the impressive growth last year. Results from our business in Canada were good even as lockdown measures intensified as the quarter progressed.

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I'm confident you'll leave this session with a clear understanding of a few key points. First, innovation and speed. It's time for us to dial-up our aggressiveness even more and go faster. Walmart is in a position of strength and we have momentum. Our confidence in our plan motivates us to accelerate, and we'll walk you through why we feel that way.","Innovation, Speed, Momentum,
Aggressiveness, Confidence",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Second, we're building a new customer-centric business model. Our customers welcome us serving them in new ways. And our assets and capabilities are being monetized in ways we haven't tapped into before. We have assets to leverage like our stores and supply chain, strengths like our store traffic and a brand trusted for value. We have foundational cornerstones like EDLP and EDLC. We can stay true to who we are and build on our strengths, while buildin a mutually reinforcing flywheel. We're starting to drive the top and bottom line in more expensive ways. Our bottom line is becoming more diversified, which will enable us more operating income growth over time. We're repositioning to be in different businesses and exiting some geographies so resources are shifted to our priorities. We're building a better model, and it's uniquely Walmart.","Customer-centric business model, Asset

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Third, we'll continue designing this business to create shared value for all our stakeholders. We're out to demonstrate that our company can do even more good for people as we grow. Communities are strengthened. Customers, associates, shareholders and suppliers benefit. Everyone wins. I'll be back to share more specifics on the strategy in a few minutes.","Shared value, Stakeholders, Growth,

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,Now I'd like to welcome Brett to add his view on the quarter and the future. Brett?,"Brett, View, Quarter, Future",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Brett. Thank you for your leadership and partnership. We're pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the year. Growth was strong across the company. Innovation and speed picked up. We moved quickly to add new capabilities to protect the health of our associates, serve customers and members safely in our stores and clubs and serve them with more capacity for pickup and delivery. We found ways to support the explosive growth in eCommerce and learned how to hire people in hours rather than days, which enabled hundreds of thousands of people to get work when they really needed it and when we really needed them.","Growth, Innovation, Speed, Associates,
eCommerce",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We managed our business well in an unpredictable environment, but we certainly didn't get everything right. Given supply constraints, our in-stock suffered significantly during portions of the year, store standards were impacted. We would reduce store hours and limit customer density all over again, but that did impact our sales. Those realities should provide some upside in 2021 as we lap the extraordinarily strong results of last year. I want to thank our associates around the world. They have been courageous. They are adapting to change. They worked really hard to overcome the hurdles presented by one of the most difficult periods in history, and I know they'll continue to do so.","Supply constraints, In-stock, Store

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The challenges of the past year came in different forms and weren't limited to the health crisis. We're all aware of the difficult social, political and economic realities that we face. These are deep-rooted problems that we all have to tackle. As for Walmart, we will continue to be part of the solutions. As it relates to the health crisis, we helped with PPE for healthcare workers and stood up COVID testing sites. We donated more than GBP625 million of food and over $55 million in grants for hunger relief in 2020. Now we're supporting the country in the vaccination effort.","Health crisis, PPE, COVID testing

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As it relates to the financial crisis, we'll help with employment and we'll help small businesses by buying their goods, building an expanded marketplace for sellers and as Sam's Club serves family owned restaurants and other small businesses. Small businesses are vital to our economy. When it comes to the social and political challenges we all face, we will engage in public conversations in ways that are thoughtful, constructive and in line with our values. We are committed to racial equity. We'll keep changing inside our company and find ways to leverage our business and influence to shape systems extending beyond our company. This work is important to me and it's important to our associates, including our leadership. And we know it's strategic. Being diverse and inclusive is smart business.","Financial crisis, Employment, Small

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"2020 not only confirmed our strategy, it accelerated it by fast-forwarding many of the customer trends we've been building toward. We feel emboldened, and are now moving with even more speed and aggressiveness. We're scaling new capabilities in businesses and designing them to work together in a mutually reinforcing way. As we imagine the future, we believe people, our customers, families will want an even better value for their money. Our merchandise assortment that is relevant to their life and seems limitless. Services that help them save time save money and get or stay healthy. An experience that is easy and enjoyable. And the knowledge that the company they do business with can be trusted to treat every one in their supply chain well and take actions that strengthen our planet.","Customer trends, Strategy, Speed,

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In the future, people will still want to shop in compelling stores. But more and more, there will be occasions where they prefer to pickup an order or have it delivered. Some customers will eventually allow us and pay us to keep them replenished in their homes on the items they routinely purchase. For an increasing number of customers, Walmart will be seen more like a service. Customers will think of us as the merchant that serve their wants and needs, but in ways that take less time and effort. We won't just be utilitarian for them.","Future shopping, Pickup, Delivery,

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,We'll serve up items and ideas that are relevant and exciting. We'll reach them directly and through other platforms.

We'll have all of these things together in a seamless way.,"Relevant, Exciting, Direct reach,

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So we're in an early stage of building a new business model that will enable us to serve people how they want to be served in any particular moment and thrive in the next generation of retail as a business. Over time, we believe the big winners in retail will be those that deliver a unique interrelated ecosystem. Many of you will remember the original Walmart productivity loop. We lowered prices, grew sales and leveraged expenses. Some of you will remember the ecosystem chart we shared in 2018. While we continue to learn, our thinking moves on.","Unique ecosystem, Interrelated

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And so we'd like to share today's version as a way to describe our emerging business model. It should help you better understand how we'll serve customers and drive sustainable diversified operating income growth over time. As I describe it, some of my comments are specific to the U.S., but you should think of this as applying in all of our priority markets around the world. Think about it as a flywheel that's spinning, powered by a mutually reinforcing set of assets.","Emerging business model, Customer
service, Sustainable growth, Operating income, Mutually reinforcing assets",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We start with the customer in the center. We're designing for them. Our relationship with them is founded on our ability to provide them the lowest prices on the items they buy all the time. They come to our stores and our app to get the things they want or need. Our first priority is to continue to earn their business when it's time to buy the big basket, the stock up trip, to be the best in first place they shop. We do that well with the Supercenter format. Having a broad assortment so close to 90% of America is an advantage.","Customer, Low prices, Relationship,
First priority, Supercenter format",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we've added pickup and delivery capabilities, we've experienced a lot of growth, but too often, we aren't able to meet the demand. This is a good problem to have, but we need to solve it quickly given how trends accelerated as a result of the pandemic. So we're going to invest more aggressively in capacity and automation to position ourselves to earn the primary destination position with customers. We are absolutely playing offense here. Customers can choose to visit a store, pickup their order, have it delivered, have it delivered into a secure box on their front step, into a garage refrigerator or all the way into their kitchen even when they're not at home.","Investment, Capacity, Automation, Customer choice, Offense",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"When you hear us say delivery, define that as the combination of delivery from our stores, clubs and eCommerce fulfillment centers. Our customers and members are indifferent as to whether their delivered items come from a store or an FC. So we can optimize for speed and cost behind the scenes as we meet or exceed customer expectations. Over time, more and more of our customers will want Walmart+ because it makes life better. That relationship will drive repeat business and provide data that enables us to serve them even better and be more personalized. It's an important piece of our strategy. For now, we're focused on continuing a high quality experience for Walmart+ members as we add capacity. Over time, we'll add more benefits to the membership to broaden its appeal.","Delivery, Customer expectations,

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Moving to 3 o'clock on the wheel. The demand we've been experiencing in general merchandise is amazing. Beyond the pandemic, our eCommerce business will continue to grow at a fast pace. We expect our eCommerce sales globally to be over $100 billion in the next couple of years. We continue to add assortment in brands. Our emphasis here is on general merchandise. We've got a lot of upside in apparel, home and hardlines. To capture that upside, we're going to pull forward investments in space and automation. As our fulfillment capacity grows, we'll use it to improve the customer experience, expand our first-party assortment, grow our marketplace and build our fulfillment services business, which is scaling nicely.","Demand, eCommerce growth, Assortment,

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Beyond selling merchandise, we can do more to serve the healthcare needs of families. They want and need high quality preventative, accessible and affordable healthcare. As you evaluate our opportunity in healthcare, consider not only our pharmacy, optical, hearing and OTC businesses, but also consider our position as the country's largest seller of food and how that relates to health. Our locations, which enable access. Our large stores and large parking lots, which give us room to expand. Our experience with the social benefits where we cover a lot of lives. And our growing digital capabilities. Together, they create the opportunity for a differentiated omnichannel healthcare business that helps a lot of people. We aren't starting from scratch.

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Financial services are also a way we can help make daily life better for customers. Last month, we announced the formation of a new fintech start-up designed to develop and offer innovative and affordable financial solutions. Our customers have been clear that they want more from us in terms of financial services, and this new approach will help us deliver for them in a differentiated way more quickly. For a fintech start-up, customer acquisition costs are high, and our platform lower those costs. We have a head-start.","Financial services, Innovative

So we must operate at a lower cost and do it in a way that's sustainable. As you know, we've had several automation tests going on. I'm very pleased to share a few of the most important forms are now ready to scale. These investments will enable us to improve the customer experience and increase productivity.

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Earlier, I mentioned diversifying our profit base. Scaling new profit pools is a priority.

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As I walked through the flywheel, I mentioned several investments.

We know where the customer is going. We have momentum and our balance sheet is strong.","Investments, Strategy, Team, Customer,
Momentum",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Here's what we see. First, the combination of stores and eCommerce is a winner. Last year's step changed our eCommerce business and our stores are an asset. We have demand and need more space earlier than we had planned a year ago. Given that delivery is a key driver of Walmart+, we need more capacity to grow Walmart+ with a high net promoter score.","Stores and eCommerce, Demand for
space, Delivery capacity, Walmart+, Net promoter score",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Second, our automation plan is now ready to scale. We'll be investing in our distribution centers, our eCommerce fulfillment centers and in market fulfillment centers, which will, in many cases, be inside of or built beside our stores. John will tell you more about what this means for our U.S. business. Those investments will enable productivity improvements for years to come. They have a nice IRR.","Automation plan, Investing, Distribution centers, E-commerce fulfillment centers, Market

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Big picture, think of our U.S. supply chain with hundreds of distribution and fulfillment centers, thousands of stores and clubs so close to so many people functioning in a hybrid fashion, automated where they should be based on volumes and complemented with onsite market fulfillment centers or offsite MFCs where we see incremental demand. Importantly, imagine our supply chain is interconnected so the cost to meet or exceed customer expectations is optimized. And imagine our growing network with the next-gen level of automation. I think the next few years will represent more change in our supply chain than even the grocery DC rollout we did to support Supercenters. It's really exciting.","Supply chain, Distribution centers,

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We'll keep investing in store remodels so that our stores are fresh and appealing. We'll also continue to invest in our people. Last fall, we changed the structure in our U.S. stores, leaning even more into teams. At that time, we gave a raise to 165,000 people. And now we'll be raising wages for 425,000 more. These are investments in people that are important to our future because they provide a great pickup, delivery and in-store experience for our customers. These investments are part of a strategy we've pursued since I started in this role. We've increased our starting wages by more than 50% since 2015.","Investing, Store remodels, People,

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Once these increases are implemented, approximately half of our U.S. hourly associates, about 730,000 people, will earn at least $15 an hour. Our average wage in the U.S. will be at least $15.25 per hour. Our supply chain associates are already earning $15 or more. And we've made additional wage investments in Sam's Club over the last few years.","Wage increases, Associates, Hourly
workers, Supply chain, Average wage",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Importantly, in addition to hourly wage rates, we'll continue investing to provide career opportunities through our internal education programs and access to affordable degrees. Because of technology, the future of work will be different and we want to prepare our associates for that journey. We believe we should do more than provide just an hourly wage. Bonuses for some roles, our 401(k) match, stock ownership plan, affordable healthcare and other components are smart investments. We'll make these investments in our supply chain and people, while also staying on track to modernize our technology. To pay for all that, we'll keep growing sales, expand our general merchandise business and scale mutually reinforcing and profitable businesses. The guidance that Brett provided this morning includes these investments for these areas I've just described.","Investing, Career opportunities,
Technology, Sales growth, Guidance",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"One way to think about us is to recognize our people and physical assets as strategic moats and realize that we're changing how we think and work to build digital products and related businesses that complement those assets and have helpful margins; marketplace, advertising and membership income, for example. We aren't strangers to membership. Sam's Club in the U.S., China and Mexico is performing very well, and that performance accelerated during 2020.

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Let me focus on Mexico and India for a minute. We see an opportunity to grow eCommerce market share in Mexico. Our stores business is strong, and an omnichannel approach will be a winner in this market. Our Walmex team has done a great job of growing eCommerce, including a strong same-day delivery option from stores and clubs. The pandemic had a similar impact to customer trends in Mexico as it did in the U.S. So now the next step for us is to leverage the momentum we have to grow 1P and 3P eCommerce through investments in technology, supply chain and customer acquisition. The team is building alternative income streams to complement our traditional retail business, including advertising.","eCommerce, Mexico, Omnichannel,

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In India, our momentum and potential for growth make this a unique opportunity. eCommerce penetration is still low, but growing rapidly. We're well positioned to grow as an emerging middle class spends more money through their mobile phones. Like the U.S. and Mexico, this is a market where we'll step on the gas to ensure we have the appropriate level of investment in areas like supply chain. The PhonePe business continues to grow and perform very well. These are homegrown businesses with innovation and problem solving for the Indian customer at their core.

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I've talked a lot about investing for growth, and I also think it's important for us to call out the areas where we're narrowing our focus and making choices. We're deploying capital to areas where we see the best opportunity for growth, while pulling back in other areas. Over the last few years, you've seen us divest restaurants and apparel specialty chain, banks, voodoo and eCommerce businesses and brands along with markets like Brazil and Argentina. We've announced new ownership structures in the U.K. and Japan, moving us to a minority position. We've executed these decisions to narrow our focus, while also developing important partnerships to drive growth like those with JD.com, Tata, Aditya Birla fashion retailer and Ninjacart.

WMT,2020,4,Doug McMillon,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In order for us to pull all of these work streams together into a cohesive well executed strategy, the organization has to think and work in new ways. Think about it as an enabler of our strategy. Whether it's moving to an agile way of working, prioritizing digital acumen and diversity in our talent base or developing new ownership structures around the world, we will function in a way that supports innovation, speed and productivity.

The best way to create a valuable company is to build for the long-term, manage the short-term and serve all the relevant stakeholders. So we're systems thinkers. We connect dots. We design sustainability into our holistic supply chain and save money doing it by eliminating waste. Environmental, social and governance issues aren't side projects.

We'll lead where we can and help make possible what's not currently possible. Climate change remains at the forefront of our ambitions on regeneration. And you've heard us talk many times about project Gigaton and our efforts to reduce emissions in the supply chain of our business and those of our suppliers.

We just completed a year with record sales of $560 billion in constant currency, including record fourth quarter sales of more than $150 billion and record operating cash flow of $36 billion. Profit growth was also strong, thanks to a number of things.

WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Now certainly we had tailwinds during the year, but we're performing extraordinarily well. This strong performance has allowed us to invest in the future of the business, invest in our associates and give good returns to shareholders. From a position of great strength, we're now going to accelerate investments in supply chain, technology, automation and our associates, allowing us to stay ahead of shifts in customer behavior. We strongly believe these investments will accelerate the company's top-line and profit growth in the mid to long-term.

Customer behavior, Supply chain, Technology",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So let's turn to highlights of the fourth quarter and the year. During the year, we saw elevated sales levels related to customer stocking up, eating at home, entertaining and educating at home and investing in home decor and their yards. And of course, those things were supported by stimulus spending. In parallel, we had incremental COVID costs, some of which will continue. We had a strong holiday season, followed by an acceleration in January.

WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Walmart U.S. comp sales excluding fuel grew 8.6% in both Q4 and for the year, including 79% annual growth in eCommerce. Walmart U.S. grew net sales by $29 billion for the year. Now for context, that is similar to the annual revenue of Dollar General and Starbucks. Sam's Club wrapped up a terrific year with full year comp sales growth of 15.8% excluding fuel and tobacco and membership income increased more than 9%.

Seven of nine markets posted positive comp sales. And for the year, International net sales grew more than $6 billion in constant currency. Adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis declined about 3% in the quarter. It was pressured by more than $1 billion of incremental COVID expenses, including associate bonuses as well as a charge of around $220 million related to a decision to repay U.K. property tax relief granted earlier in the year.","eCommerce growth, International sales,

WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The fourth quarter also included some increased tech expenses and increased wage pressure related to recently announced structure changes in Walmart U.S. as well as additional headcount to ensure our holiday season was a success, which it was. Excluding the U.K. charge, total company adjusted operating income would have increased. Despite various headwinds, Walmart U.S. adjusted operating income increased 6.5% on solid gross margin improvement and continued reduction in eCommerce losses as well as some benefit related to timing of allocations.","Tech expenses, Wage pressure,

WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"For the year, adjusted operating income increased over 9% in constant currency with each segment growing significantly despite more than $4 billion of incremental COVID cost. Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.39, but would have been about $0.37 higher if not for COVID cost and the U.K. property tax repayment. GAAP EPS was a $0.74 loss, significantly impacted by the loss on businesses in the U.K. and Japan, as both are classified as assets held for sale. That's partially offset by an unrealized gain in our investment in JD.com, the value of which has increased by $9 billion since our initial investment. Operating cash flow for the year was exceptionally strong at $36 billion and the company returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. So in summary, it was a great year financially. And on an underlying basis, it was a strong finish.","Adjusted operating income, COVID cost,

WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Let's now talk about how we plan to continue the strong momentum. Because of our financial strength, competitive position and ability to execute, we're in a unique position to continue innovating and serving customers in multiple ways.

This new infrastructure will allow us to expand eCommerce assortment, enabling us to reduce both shipping time and costs. We'll step up automation in DCs to deliver aisle and department-ready pallets, stores. We'll continue to refresh our existing stores by enhancing pickup and delivery capacity, merchandising programs and efficiency initiatives.","Lean infrastructure, eCommerce

It's exciting to see the emerging middle class rapidly adopting eCommerce and using their mobile phones to use money transfer, insurance and other services. Meanwhile, we'll step up technology investments to continue upgrading legacy enterprise systems and customer-facing technology. We're on a multi-year journey of modernizing our tech stack and capabilities to increase the efficient use of the cloud and simplify customer and associate experiences.","eCommerce, Technology investments,

WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"As we accelerate investment, capex is expected to be around $14 billion this year with most of the increase versus last year in the U.S. Over the next few years, we expect capex to be around 2.5% to 3% of sales. While this is higher than the past few years, it is far below the capex peak of 4% to 5% of sales during the period of heavy Supercenter growth. This spend will allow us to fully optimize our strategy, and in turn, accelerate the company's top-line and profit growth rates in the mid to long-term.","Investment, Capex, Sales, Strategy,

WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"After years of transition, these investments should put us in position for 4% plus sales growth and operating income growth rates higher than sales. 4% top-line growth would basically be the equivalent of adding a Fortune 100 company every year. Our unique financial strength allows us to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders while growing the business. And as you saw this morning, we increased our dividend for the 48th consecutive year. And we authorized a new $20 billion share repurchase program, which we plan to execute over the next three years or so. There are so many initiatives under way that give us confidence that these are the right investments at the right time. We're already seeing proof points, and you'll hear more about these later on.","Financial strength, Investments, Sales

WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We expect continued strong growth in the U.S. businesses and expect even higher international growth rates as we focus on key markets and making money in new ways. We'll continue improving margin mix through an enhanced general merchandise offering, new brands and marketplace growth with a greater push toward expanding fulfillment and other services for sellers. We'll drive existing and new customer growth through initiatives like Walmart+. We'll grow sales and profit increasingly with growing higher margin businesses and advertising, financial services, marketplace, healthcare services and the like. Our operating discipline will continue to sharpen. After a pause in FY '22, primarily because of additional wage investments, I expect expense leverage to continue at or above 20 basis points a year.","Strong growth, International growth,

WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Let me turn now specifically to our expectations for this current year. We feel very good about the underlying business and ability to compete from a position of strength. However, we're still facing similar COVID-related challenges as we have over the past several quarters, which caused us to suspend guidance and continues to make short-term guidance very challenging. Despite that we want to give you the best view we can at this time given what we know and what we see right now.","Underlying business, Competition,

WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We know we'll have both headwinds and tailwinds this year, the balance and degree of which isn't clear. As the year progresses, we hope to get more clarity around COVID impacts, vaccine efficacy and availability, the scale and duration of economic stimulus and the mid-term economic climate globally. Even if conditions stay generally similar to now, for any length of time this year and with limited additional stimulus, we would expect continued solid underlying performance from Walmart U.S. with low-single-digit comps and continued solid eCommerce sales growth.","COVID impacts, Vaccine efficacy,
Economic stimulus, Mid-term economic climate, Underlying performance",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Low-single-digit comps would result in around a 10% comp growth on a two year stack basis, so very healthy growth. We would expect the level of comp growth to be more heavily weighted toward the middle of the year as a result of the timing of COVID-related demand and stimulus in FY '21. Now of course that could look different depending on future stimulus and/or significant changes in customer spending patterns as the COVID crisis hopefully moderates at some point.","Low-single-digit comps, Comp growth,
Two year stack basis, COVID-related demand, Stimulus",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The comparisons against last year are unique. There were stretches that were really strong and others less so, driven by how people responded to the virus, how they stocked up, how they responded to being at home more, and of course, stimulus actions. In International, excluding divestitures, we expect to see higher level of sales growth versus the U.S. with strength in India, Mexico and China. And at Sam's, we expect low-single-digit comps excluding fuel and tobacco.","Strong growth, Sales growth,
International growth, Low-single-digit comps, Stimulus actions",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Total company sales are expected to decline, due primarily to the divestiture or anticipated divestitures of businesses in the U.K., Japan and Argentina. Excluding that, we would expect total company sales to grow in the low-single-digits. From a profitability standpoint, given the assumptions mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of divestitures, we would expect operating income and EPS to be flat to up slightly versus a very strong profit year in FY '21.","Total company sales, Sales growth,
Operating income, EPS, Divestiture",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"In regards to the U.K. transaction, when we announced it, we said we expected EPS dilution of approximately $0.25 in the first full year assuming we held proceeds and cash. We expect to hold more cash than normal during this time due to strong cash flow, but plan to reallocate that cash in a thoughtful way in the coming quarters into new projects as well as share repurchase. We still expect to make up for the EPS hit in the mid-term, but there will be timing impacts that negatively affect FY '22 EPS by about $0.20. However, this should provide a tailwind to EPS growth in future years as we reallocate more of that cash. Due in large part to the International transactions, we expect operating income dollars and EPS to decline slightly in FY '22 on a consolidated basis, but we expect Walmart U.S. operating income to increase in spite of some continued COVID costs, accelerated technology costs and increased wages.","EPS dilution, Cash flow, Share
repurchase, Operating income, COVID costs",Walmart
WMT,2020,4,Brett Biggs,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Alternative revenue streams like advertising and Walmart fulfillment services are gaining traction and are expected to become a larger portion of profit growth in the future, including FY '22 along with a fairly steady gross margin rate. Due to the International transactions and FY '21 COVID-related expense and profit timing, we expect the FY '22 quarterly profit growth cadence versus last year to be quite variable. We expect Q1 operating income to be relatively flat to last year and EPS to be flat to slightly up, reflecting the presence of as in our financials for about half the quarter and some tax rate fluctuations.","Alternative revenue streams, Gross

And I thought a lot about this question lately. And even for someone like me that's been here for over 20 years, I have to step back and see the evolution through a different lens. Walmart's different than it was last year, three years ago, and certainly, five years ago. It's faster, it's more creative and it's less risk averse.

We're one of the largest eCommerce companies in the world, approaching $100 billion in revenue in the next couple of years, and we believe $200 billion a few years after that. We have one of the largest marketplace businesses in the world. And now, we're scaling a marketplace fulfillment services business to grow even faster.

We have a rapidly growing advertising platform, which should be a multi-billion dollar business in the very near future. We're a global leader in supply chain innovation with exciting initiatives on the table. We're a global leader in sustainability with the clear aspirational goal to become regenerative. We have both growth and scale. We reduced our exposures in Brazil, Argentina, the U.K., Japan and we'll still have a top-line that's over $0.5 trillion.

COST,2022,4,Richard Galanti,Chief Financial Officer,"Core merchandise's contribution to gross margin was lower by 67 basis points year over year and by 23 ex gas inflation. The sales mix negatively impacted the core, primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our increasing and outsized gasoline sales. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in Q4, our core and core margins were lower by 26 basis points. That's pretty much in line with each of the last three quarters when it ranged from minus 39 basis points year over year in Q3, minus 28 in Q2 and minus 18 in Q1 on a year-over-year basis.","core merchandise, gross margin, sales mix, core margin, sales penetration",Costco Wholesale Corp.

Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 20 basis points and higher by 34 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gas, of course, as well as business centers and travel were better year over year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy, food court and optical, but overall, a positive year-over-year change. Our 2% reward, as I mentioned, on an ex gas inflation basis was higher or down five -- lower or down five basis points, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members.","core-on-core, gross margin, businesses, gas, sales penetration",Costco Wholesale Corp.
COST,2022,4,Richard Galanti,Chief Financial Officer,"In terms of LIFO. LIFO, as you know, with inflation has been increasing. It was 27 basis points, down year over year -- or higher year over year.

The central expense was lower or better year over year by four on a reported basis, and a lower or better by two without those items. Within that IT spend in the quarter was flat as a percentage of sales. Stock compensation, as I mentioned, the biggest impact typically is in the first quarter, so you'll see a little bit of a difference there. Next on the income statement is a pre-opening expense.

Two of the things that I mentioned in this report, of course, is the 43 million related to the Citi rewards program as well as the hourly wage increases. Those are certainly two things that have impacted the year-over-year comparison. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was $1 million lower year over year. So, coming in at $36 million compared to $37. And on the interest income and other, essentially flat year over year.

Net sales for the quarter came in at $32.3 billion, a 10.8% increase over the $29.1 billion of sales during the second quarter of last fiscal year. This year's 12-week second quarter included one additional sales day in the United States versus last year, due to the shift of Thanksgiving. But while we gained a sales day in the quarter, our pre-Thanksgiving and Black Friday holiday weekend sales fell in the first quarter this year, compared to the second quarter last year. Combined, these two factors negatively impacted second quarter sales results by an estimated 1.4% in the U.S., and slightly less worldwide, somewhat at or about 1.1%.","sales, net sales, quarter, United States, worldwide",Costco Wholesale Corp.
COST,2018,2,Richard Galanti,Chief Financial Officer,"The shift also negatively impacted e-commerce sales results by an estimated -7 to -8 percentage points in the second quarter.

Given that we don't have a calendar year, so it doesn't align with the traditional calendar year, you take the number of days in our fiscal year, which fall before or after December 31.

The first thing that comes in some of the news releases very quickly is where we beat the number or we missed the number. When we look at first call and the 27 or so analysts that put numbers in there, it appears to us there are about 12 of the 27 over the last month or so have adjusted their numbers, their estimates for some estimate of tax reform benefit. If you adjust based on what they were before that, it looks like the first call number of $1.46, I believe, comes down $0.04 or $0.05. But I'm just mentioning that because I assume there's confusion out there on everybody as we report given this quarter of transition.","earnings reports, analyst estimates, tax reform benefits, first call numbers, confusion",Costco Wholesale Corp.

Specifically, our Q3 organic revenue growth accelerated to 4.2%, with both our North America and International businesses delivering mid-single-digit growth.

Frito-Lay sustained its strength with 6% organic revenue growth and gained market share in the macro-snack category in the quarter. These results were powered by strong net revenue growth across each of our $1 billion brands, including double-digit growth for Tostitos, high-single-digit growth for Cheetos, and mid-single-digit growth for Doritos and Ruffles. We also saw continued strength in the e-commerce and large format channels, while trends in the convenience and gas channel meaningfully improved versus the previous quarter.

Quaker's third quarter performance included strong double-digit net revenue growth in lite snacks and side dishes such as pasta and macaroni and cheese. Pancake mixes and syrup sales increased at a high-single-digit rate, while both hot and ready-to-eat cereal also delivered good growth.

Our focus will remain on improving the performance and marketplace execution of these terrific brands, while also effectively competing in the category with existing brands such as Mountain Dew. Overall, I'm very pleased with PBNA's performance during the third quarter and I'm encouraged by our North America energy integration process as it nears its completion.

Third Quarter",PepsiCo Inc.
PEP,2020,3,Hugh Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"From a margin perspective, our core gross margin declined 60 basis points in the quarter. The year-over-year decline is driven by our recently completed acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery and certain COVID-19-related costs included in our cost of goods sold. Our core operating margin decline moderated and was down 40 basis points in the quarter as we increased our advertising and marketing spend and experienced $147 million of higher labor, personal protective equipment, and logistics and service costs associated with COVID-19. When excluding the incremental COVID-19-related costs, our core operating margin increased 40 basis points. We expect some of the COVID-19-related costs to persist and remain committed to making the necessary long-term investments to support our employees and customers, while also investing in capabilities that drive competitive advantages for our business.","Margin Perspective, Core Gross Margin, Year-Over-Year Decline, COVID-19-Related Costs,

So, based on what we can reasonably predict for the balance of this year, we are updating our full-year guidance and now expect: organic revenue growth of approximately 4%; and core earnings per share of approximately $5.50; and we continue to expect a core annual effective tax rate of approximately 21%. Based on current market consensus rates, we now expect foreign exchange translation headwinds to negatively impact our net revenue and core earnings per share performance by negative 2 percentage points and this expectation is reflected in our core EPS guidance.","Resilient Business, Uneven Recoveries, Full-Year Guidance, Organic Revenue Growth, Core

PEP,2020,2,Ramon L. Laguarta,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Our second quarter began during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic for most of our markets. As we started the quarter, we set clear, simple priorities to manage the business successfully through the enormous challenges that were happening with the consumer, customer, economy and operating environment. These priorities included: ensuring the protection and safety of all our associates, especially our critical front-line workers, by providing suitable personal protective equipment and sanitizers, conducting health screenings and implementing contact tracing and social distancing protocols; providing the best service possible to our customers and competing to win in the marketplace; ensuring that we have adequate liquidity to run the business; continuing to invest in capabilities that will drive our long-term success; supporting the communities that we do business in and the people who live in them; and delivering strong financial results while executing against the above priorities.","COVID-19

PEP,2020,2,Ramon L. Laguarta,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Based on this clarity of purpose, I'm pleased to report that our business performed relatively well through this unprecedented level of change. Specifically, our organic revenue increased 3.3% for the first half of this year, while second quarter organic revenue declined 0.3%. During the second quarter, our portfolio worked well as our global snacks business remained very resilient with 5% organic revenue growth, while global beverages declined minus 7% as increased take-home consumption was more than offset by a decline in the convenience and gas and away-from-home channels.","Revenue growth, organic

PEP,2020,2,Ramon L. Laguarta,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"The months of March and April were particularly challenging, as overall global economic growth was contracting and restrictions, closures, and the resultant impact on consumer mobility had a significant effect on our performance. However, we saw an improvement in our business performance and channel dynamics in May and June, as population mobility increased after many economies gradually began to reopen both in developed and in developing market.","Global economic growth,

PEP,2020,2,Ramon L. Laguarta,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Now, turning to our business review for the quarter, I will start with North America. Our snacks and food businesses performed very well, while our beverage business was challenged but continued to improve its competitive positioning. Within snacks and food, we delivered strong organic revenue growth across both Frito-Lay and Quaker, driven by strong category growth and market share gains. Consumer eating habits continued to evolve with consumers spending more time at home, which benefits the at-home breakfast, snacking and dinner occasions.","snacks, food, beverages,

PEP,2020,2,Ramon L.

Frito's net revenue growth was broad-based across all our major brands, including double-digit growth in Tostitos, Fritos and Cheetos, high-single digit growth in Ruffles, and mid-single digit growth in Doritos.

PEP,2020,2,Ramon L. Laguarta,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Now, I will turn to our North America Beverage business, which had a challenging quarter as we had expected. Organic revenue declined 7% due to declines in the convenience and gas and foodservice channels, which more than offset good growth in other channels such as grocery, mass and dollar stores. However, our revenue management initiatives enabled strong pricing gains across the business and within key categories such as carbonated soft drinks and sports drinks.","organic revenue growth,

Our second quarter results, which incorporated the months of March, April and May, were significantly impacted by the timing of COVID-19 restrictions and closures, which varied by country and by region. As we saw in North America, our international snacks and food businesses proved to be more resilient than beverages, with an increase in organic revenue growth of 2% in snacks versus a decline of 5% in beverages.","COVID-19 impact,

In addition, our snacks business has remained very resilient. However, we do expect an uneven recovery in international markets, as a greater level of macroeconomic uncertainty would likely persist due to varying responses and measures by country to address pandemic-related impacts and population mobility; a greater volatility in travel and tourism trends; and greater differences in disposable income and affordability. These are two metrics we will be keeping a very close eye on as we consider -- as and when we consider surgical adjustments to offer great value in lower income market.","international business

PEP,2020,2,Hugh F. Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. As Ramon mentioned earlier, our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to retail closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19. In addition, our business experienced higher labor, personal protective equipment, logistics and service costs associated with COVID-19. These costs coupled with an adverse channel mix shift in key markets impacted our operating margin in the second quarter.","COVID-19 disruptions,

Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"We expect some of these costs to persist and remain committed to making the necessary long-term investments to support our employees and customers, while also investing in capabilities that drive competitive advantages for our business. To mitigate some of these challenges, we've accelerated our efforts to control what we can. This includes tightly managing our discretionary expenses, reducing non-essential advertising and marketing spend to reflect the realities of the current environment and optimizing our pricing wherever possible. We have also reduced the complexity of our product offerings by prioritizing high-velocity SKUs to maximize production capacity.","cost management, investment, advertising spend, pricing optimization, product complexity",PepsiCo Inc.

Based on what we can currently project for the full year 2020, we continue to expect our annual core effective tax rate to be approximately 21%; total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion, comprised of dividends of $5.5 billion and share repurchases of $2 billion; and we now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact our reported revenue and core EPS by 3 percentage points based on current market consensus rates.

Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"Now, as we look ahead to our third quarter, we expect our organic revenue to increase within a low-single digit range, which incorporates the geographic perspectives and channel dynamics that Ramon referenced earlier. We expect our core operating margin to contract, albeit at a less severe rate than what we experienced during the second quarter, as greater costs associated with keeping our employees safe persist.

Specifically, our former Europe Sub-Saharan Africa division has been reclassified as Europe and will no longer include Sub-Saharan Africa.

PEP,2019,4,Ramon Luis Laguarta,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Ravi, and good morning, everybody. Approximately about a year ago, we embarked on a plan to make PepsiCo Faster, Stronger and Better. We've made very good progress against these initiatives, and I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of the full year financial targets that we communicated to you about a year ago. Most notably, organic revenue growth accelerated to 4.5% in 2019, our fastest rate of growth since 2015. Our organic revenue growth was very broad-based across all divisions, with Frito-Lay delivering its fastest rate of growth since 2013 and PBNA delivered its fastest rate of growth since 2015. Our developing and emerging markets also delivered high single-digit growth despite ongoing volatility and uncertainty in certain parts of the world. We invested in becoming Faster by increasing our global advertising and marketing spending by more than 12% for the full year, reflecting investment across snacks and beverages, and in both our large and established brands and our emerging brands; expanding our market presence by increasing route capacity, adding merchandising racks and coolers and advancing the technologies that we deploy to drive greater and more precise execution; and investing in additional manufacturing capacity to remove bottlenecks and increase growth capacity for our products. This includes investments in new plants, new lines and added distribution infrastructure.","PepsiCo, Frito-Lay, PBNA, advertising and marketing

PEP,2019,4,Ramon Luis Laguarta,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Whilst we intend to continue to invest back into our business, we know that sustaining higher growth would require building stronger capabilities, ones which will be difficult to match by our competitors. During 2019, we enhanced our consumer and customer-facing capabilities, strengthened our organizational culture and transformed our cost management. Specifically, we invested in data analytics and other information technology to build consumer intimacy and achieve precision at scale. By capturing and analyzing more granular consumer-level data, we can understand the consumer in a more individualized way to both customize communication and executing in every store with precisely the right products placed in the right location and at the right price. We strengthened our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce, but our retail sales were nearly $2 billion in 2019. To meet the growing need across channels for greater customization and faster innovation, we're investing in an end-to-end agile value chain that can deliver more precision and variety to enable us to win in the marketplace.","PepsiCo, consumer intimacy, data analytics, IT, omnichannel

And we evolved our way our values and ways of working to foster a culture where employees act like owners with a greater sense of empowerment and accountability. We call this The PepsiCo Way, which includes a set of seven leadership behaviors that have been rapidly embraced by our organization. And we took a completely holistic approach to cost management, one in which we manage all costs as an investment. In doing so, we challenged the entire cost structure to evaluate cost and benefit of our spending. In 2019, we delivered in excess of $1 billion in productivity savings and plan to deliver this amount annually through 2023.","PepsiCo, organizational structure, values and ways of

We intend to achieve 100% sustainably farmer-sourced agricultural raw materials by the end of 2020, which include potatoes, whole corn, oats and oranges. Improving water stewardship. We're striving to improve water use sufficiency and aiming to replenish 100% of the water we consume for manufacturing in high water risk areas by 2025.","PepsiCo, sustainability, agriculture, water stewardship,

PEP,2019,4,Ramon Luis Laguarta,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"To complement our Faster, Stronger and Better initiatives, we also made investments to fortify our portfolio for future growth. Specifically, we invested in our SodaStream business, which grew net revenue more than 20% last year in order to capture an incremental growth opportunity. We announced our intent to acquire BFY Brands, the makers of the fast-growing PopCorners brand, which will enhance our premium snack portfolio. We're in the process of acquiring Pioneer Foods, which will build the foundation for future growth and scale in Africa, a key emerging market where our growth opportunities remain vast. And we acquired CytoSport, the makers of Muscle Milk, which expands our presence in sports nutrition, providing opportunities for additional growth and category expansion.

PEP,2019,4,Ramon Luis Laguarta,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now let me discuss our operating results. As I noted earlier, our organic revenue growth accelerated to 4.5% for the full year 2019 versus 3.7% in 2018, exceeding the initial target we set a year ago. All our divisions contributed to this growth, including a 3% increase in developed markets and an 8% increase in developing and emerging markets. Frito-Lay North America had a very strong year with a 4.5% increase in organic revenue, along with an acceleration of volume growth in the second half of the year. The business gained value share in both salty and savory snacks in 2019 and improved its customer service levels. Frito's results were driven by the investments we made in innovation, marketing and consumer insights, supply chain and manufacturing and go-to-market capacity. This included a double-digit increase in advertising and marketing spend, additional plant, warehouse and distribution center capacity, and additional routes, racks and selling resources.","Revenue growth, Organic revenue growth, Frito-Lay North America,

Our multipack offerings also delivered very good growth as we have continuously expanded the variety of brand and flavor combinations. The breadth of our growth was also evident across every key retail channel. We increased net revenue growth in grocery, mass, club, convenience, foodservice and e-commerce. And Frito-Lay was once again the #1 contributor to U.S. food and beverage retail sales growth in 2019. With respect to the fourth quarter, Frito delivered 3% organic revenue growth, driven by 2% volume growth and 1% net price realization. The deceleration in net price realization was largely a function of the timing of pricing actions taken in 2018. We expect our net price realization trends to improve over the coming months and have strong innovation and merchandising plans in place for the business to deliver very good growth in 2020.","Revenue growth, Organic revenue growth, Frito-Lay, Innovation, Retail

We also invested in improving our presence in the away-from-home channel by becoming the preferred beverage partner for JetBlue, Carnival Cruise Lines and Regal Cinemas for the past year.

During the fourth quarter, we took the opportunity to think more strategically about this part of the world. We decided to split the organizational structure of our prior AMENA division into AMESA, which includes Africa, Middle East and South Asia; and APAC, which includes Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand and China. By creating one operating sector centered on the Asian consumer and another centered on the Middle Eastern, South Asian and African consumer, we believe we can enhance our focus on accelerating top line growth.","Organic revenue growth, Europe, Snacks,

As Ramon noted, for 2020, we expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency earnings-per-share growth. We expect foreign exchange to have an approximately negative 1 % point impact on net revenue and core EPS growth and, therefore, expect our core U.S. dollar EPS to be $5.88 in 2020. For 2020, we also expect our core annual core effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, reflecting capex of approximately $5 billion. The higher rate of capital spending is associated with accelerating progress on our strategic growth priorities, as Ramon laid out earlier. We expect our capital spending to remain at or around these levels for the next few years and now expected to moderate to 5% of sales by 2023. We expect total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion in 2020, comprised of dividends of $5.5 billion and share repurchases of $2 billion. The expected cash returns reflect a 7% increase in the annualized dividend per share effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2020.

About two months ago we shared with you in some detail our priorities for the business and our financial goals for 2019. So today we're keeping our prepared comments short, just touching on the highlights for the quarter and then we will leave enough time to get to all your questions. I will start by simply saying that we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter. Our rate of organic revenue growth accelerated to 5.2%, our highest rate of quarterly growth in more than three years. This topline performance was broad based with particularly strong organic revenue growth at Frito-Lay North America, which grew 6%; and our international divisions, while negatively affecting our reported basis by ForEx and refranchising, delivered organic revenue growth of 8% in ESSA and 10% in both Latin America and AMENA. We also had solid growth and continued progress at PepsiCo Beverages North America where organic revenue was up 2% -- 2.5% in the quarter.","Revenue Growth, Organic Revenue

And our productivity and restructuring actions were implemented according to plan. Our strong performance in the quarter is emblematic of a number of key strengths in the business. Amongst them, the health and resilience of our categories, our leading brands, a broad-based portfolio capable of evolving to satisfy consumer tastes, a well-developed geographic footprint with strong positions in our largest markets, suite of strong and relevant capabilities across the value chain, scale that allow us to run our operations very efficiently, and of course our highly engaged and motivated associates. We execute every day in a way that enables us to win in the marketplace.

To achieve these objectives, we're focused on becoming faster, stronger, and better. We'll become faster by being more consumer-centric and accelerating investment for topline growth and winning in the marketplace. This means broadening our portfolio and packaging formats to win locally, fortifying our North American business -- businesses by investing in Frito-Lay North America and PepsiCo Beverages North America, and accelerating our international expansion with a disciplined focus on right to win markets. We'll become stronger by transforming our capabilities and our culture.","Faster, Stronger, Better, Consumer-Centric, International Expansion",PepsiCo Inc.

And finally, we'll become better by integrating our purpose agenda into our business strategy with a particular focus on four critical initiatives. First, advancing farming practices to optimize crop yields, protect human rights, improve farmer livelihoods, and secure supply. Second, replenishing more water than we use in water stressed areas. Third, creating a circular economy for plastics. And fourth, increasing the appeal of our products by reducing added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats and adding more positive ingredients.

PEP,2019,1,Hugh Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"Great. Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. I have just a few comments on the balance of your outlook. As we mentioned in the release, we are reiterating each of the components of our 2019 guidance. Namely, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 4%, a core effective tax rate of approximately 21%. core constant currency EPS to decline approximately 1%, free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, and total cash return to shareholders of approximately $8 billion comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3 billion. With both organic revenue growth and core constant currency EPS growth higher in Q1 than in our full-year targets, that implies the growth rate for the balance of the year will be below the Q1 growth rates. So, let me address how you should think about that starting with the topline. First, the rate of organic revenue growth at FLNA in Q1 was extraordinary.","Organic Revenue Growth, Core

PEP,2019,1,Hugh Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"We don't expect that rate of growth to continue for the balance of the year. And second, Q1 represented our easiest lap of the year so balance of year laps will be more difficult, especially in the back half of the year. From an EPS perspective, you should consider the following: One, in Q1 we had the benefit of lapping the one-time frontline bonus from 2018 and we also benefited from approximately $50 million of insurance recoveries in the current year. Two, over the balance of the year, we will be lapping gains from various strategic asset sales and refranchising gains and insurance recoveries most notably in Q2. Three, our rate of net commodity inflation, which includes the impact of transactional foreign exchange, is expected to accelerate in the second quarter. And finally, our pace of planned reinvestments will accelerate over the course of the year and you will see this reflected both in core EPS as well as in our operating margin performance.","Easy Lap, Lapping Gains, Net

PEP,2018,4,Ramon Laguarta,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"And if there's one thing I'd like you to take from our discussion today is that, we view topline acceleration as the single biggest opportunity to create more shareholder value. To achieve accelerated topline growth, we intend to strengthen and broaden our product portfolio packaging formats to win locally in convenient foods and beverages. And this means growing our core businesses as we continue to evolve our product portfolio and sharpening our focus on key geographies. Across snacks and beverages, we'll invest to capture a greater share of consumption occasions, from indulgent to functional, social to individual, value to premium, and across dayparts from morning to night. We plan to do this by continuing to grow our core brands, which include $22 billion brands, and building and/or acquiring new brands to cover new demand spaces, as we have recently done with bubly, LIFEWTR, update in Path or Bare.","Accelerated Growth, Product

Here, we see themes of convenient mini meals, local street foods and local recipes, just a few inspirations to evolve our portfolio in very locally relevant ways. We intend to rapidly scale our beyond the bottle initiative, building on the foundations of our recent acquisition of SodaStream and our internally developed Spire, Drinkfinity and Aquafina water station platforms to offer consumers even greater variety and choice in beverage formats.

That is providing the consumer four key benefits: variety, that is what I want; ubiquity, where I want it; desirability, from a brand I trust; and value, with the benefits or affordability that appeals to me. Our entire commercial agenda is centered on delivering these four benefits to the consumer.","Investment, Growth Model, Consumer Benefits, International Expansion, Disciplined Focus",PepsiCo Inc.
PEP,2018,4,Ramon Laguarta,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Our second set of priorities relates to becoming stronger. This involves becoming more capable, leaner, more agile and less bureaucratic. In doing so, we will drive down cost and that enables us to plow the savings back into the business to develop scale and sharpen core capabilities that drive even greater efficiency and effectiveness creating a virtuous cycle. Our productivity programs will be guided by a set of universally applied principles, namely: achieving local affordability; simplifying and standardizing processes; collaborating across functions rather than optimizing within functions to achieve lowest cost end-to-end processes; relentlessly automating and merging the best of our optimized business models with the best new thinking and technologies. Just as importantly, we're also adopting a philosophy that recognizes that not all the capabilities or costs are equal, so we'll be very discriminating in where we need to pay for best-in-class or we should pay for just good enough.","Becoming Stronger, Productivity

These capabilities are: indispensable brand building; science and design-led innovation; point of choice excellence across all channels, whether traditional or emerging; consumer intimacy, that is leveraging technology and connecting data to deepen our relationships with consumers, moving from relationships with groups of consumers to relationships with individual consumers. This enables a number of benefits, from individually based media and marketing engagement to personalized pricing; and finally, supply chain agility, where we deploy integrated and more robust data to improve demand forecasting and automation, advance robotics and other technology to make our manufacturing assets and go-to-market systems much more flexible to satisfy that demand with greater speed, precision and efficiency. And of course, executing this aggressive agenda of top-line acceleration productivity and capability building will require fostering a high-performance culture, one that is aligned on a common set of leadership behaviors and is supported by the right incentive systems. Among the values we are emphasizing throughout the organization are being more center on the consumer, acting like owners, and moving with focus and speed.","Cost Structure, Productivity

While there are investments in each category in each operating sector, in terms of emphasis, in Frito-Lay North America and our international sectors, there is relatively greater emphasis on adding manufacturing and go-to-market capacity and supply chain transformation. In the case of North America Beverages, there is relatively greater emphasis on investing to support the core brands, ramped up innovation, and adding and redirecting resources to drive enhanced local marketplace execution. And across all the sectors, as well as at the corporate center, we're investing to drive global systems harmonization and standardization.","Restructuring Actions, Investments in Business, Supply Chain Transformation, Global Systems Harmonization, Local

And we're confident that the investments will return meaningful value to investors over time. Beyond the stepped-up investments, our 2019 core earnings performance will be impacted by three other factors: first, we're lapping a number of strategic asset sale and refranchising gains and insurance recoveries net of a front-line bonus that contributed approximately $0.17 to earnings in 2018; second, we expect the core tax rate to increase to approximately 21% in 2019 from a rate of 18.8% in 2018; and third, we expect foreign exchange translation to be an approximate 2-percentage-point headwind to both revenue and EPS performance in 2019.","Investment Analysis, Strategic

So, moving on to business. For the quarter, we generated $16.5 billion of net revenue, driven by 4.9% organic revenue growth and delivered core earnings per share of $1.59, a 9% increase on a core constant currency basis. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance in the quarter.

And while North American beverages profit performance was impacted by inflation and a double-digit increase in advertising expense, the sector posted 2.5% organic revenue growth with a good balance between volume growth and net price utilization. Frito-Lay North America delivered balanced volume growth and net price realization, driven by strong innovation and brand marketing. For example, in June, we launched Stacy's Cheese Petites, inspired by French cheese puffs. These bite-sized cheese snacks have real cheese baked inside, creating a sophisticated snacking experience. In fact, cheese is the primary ingredient. Petites are a good sources of calcium and have six grams of protein per serving.

The eight-week media campaign supporting the program spanned social media channels and was also featured on Pandora to reach our consumers listening to music. Tostitos growth was fueled by new products such as roasted red pepper and black bean and garlic. To support the product launches, we created a program to drive trial during the summer get togethers.

We garnered more than 80,000 submissions, and the program has now been localized and rolled across seven additional countries and counting. Turning to North American beverages, while the marketplace remains highly competitive, we are encouraged by improving overall category growth trends and a generally rational pricing environment.

Certainly, strong innovation across the portfolios contributing to the improving performance. For example, LIFEWTR continues its journey, advancing and showcasing sources of creativity with the launch of our Series 6 bottles themed diversity and design. LIFEWTR achieved more than $150 million in measured retail sales in 2017 which was its introductory year and is on pace to achieve more than $200 million in measured retail sales in 2018.

And in June, we launched Gatorade Zero with zero sugar and all the electrolytes of Gatorade Thirst Quencher. Gatorade Zero's providing hydration options for more athletes in more locations and is off to a strong start. And we believe our stepped up advertising and marketing, particularly on trademarks, Pepsi and Mountain Dew are also starting to contribute to improved performance, as we saw sequential net revenue acceleration in both trademarks of the third quarter. Commodity inflation, operating cost inflation, particularly in transportation costs, product mix, and a stepped up advertising expense each pressured our profit performance in the quarter.","Gatorade Zero, Advertising Expense, Commodity Inflation, Operating Cost Inflation",PepsiCo Inc.

In addition, Quaker light snacks gained market share with high-single-digit retail sales growth. And our Aunt Jemima pancake business grew retail sales for the eighth consecutive quarter.

Strong marketplace execution led to continued solid growth across many of our key international markets. Within Latin America, organic revenue grew 10%, driven by high-single-digit growth in Mexico and double-digit growth in Argentina, Brazil, and Columbia. The LatAm team is doing an excellent job building our business and growing our market share in key countries in the region. In our Europe, Sub-Sahara, Africa sector, Russia and South Africa each grew organic revenue high-single-digits while Turkey and Poland had double-digit organic revenue growth. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the UK and France.","Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Poland",PepsiCo Inc.
PEP,2018,3,Indra Nooyi,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Again, continued good performance from this team. And in AMENA, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Saudi-Arabia, India, and Egypt and high-single-digit organic revenue growth in Australia. Excellent results from our AMENA team. This strong top-line performance translated into impressive bottom-line results with core constant currency operating profit up 12% in our international divisions as a group. The international results reflect our initiatives to continue to expand distribution of our big global brands and to innovate in locally relevant ways. For example, we continued to drive international growth of our zero sugar Pepsi Black and Pepsi Max trademarks with introductions of lime and cherry flavors across Eastern Europe, lime in the Nordics, and lime and vanilla flavors in the Philippines.","International revenue growth,

And the Quaker trademark continues its global expansion, from the launch of Quaker Super Foods in Mexico to our launches of Quaker Kids and Quaker Multigrain Instant Oatmeal platforms in China. Finally, during the quarter, we reached an agreement to acquire SodaStream. As we said on the day of the initial announcement, we believe PepsiCo and SodaStream are an inspired bunch. Daniel Birnbaum and the rest of the SodaStream team have built an extraordinary company that is offering consumers the ability to make great tasting beverages while reducing the amount of waste generated.

After considering our year-to-date performance and other factors, we have updated our guidance for 2018. Specifically, we now expect at least 3% organic revenue growth for the full year. We now expect our core effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. We continue to expect core constant currency EPS growth of 9%. However, we now expect core earnings per share in US dollar terms of $5.65 which reflections a one-point headwind from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus rates due to the recent strengthening of the US dollar. This is an 8% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23.

And we now expect net capital spending of approximately $3.3 billion. We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018 with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a 15% increase in the annualized dividend per share that began with the June payment and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion. Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following items to consider for the fourth quarter. Frito-Lay North America is lapping 5% organic revenue growth from the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect operating profit to decline in our AMENA division as we lap strong results and a refranchising gain in Jordan from the fourth quarter of 2017.","Free cash flow, net capital

For example, we have substantially increased flexible can line capacity, we expanded our co-pack network to give us greater packaging flexibility in an asset life model, and we are approaching having 60% of our route network converted to delivery via our geobox trailers, and we have equipped many of our trucks with chillers to expand our chilled DSD network.","CSR package variety, supply chain reconfiguration, flexible can line capacity, co-

PEP,2018,1,Indra K. Nooyi,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"We believe our strategy is sound and is positioning us well for the future. We are focused on the past three quarters, where our financial results have not lived up to our expectations from the North American Beverage business. So, what is the issue? Simply put, while most parts of the business are performing well, recent losses in cola market share in North America have led to subpar top-line and bottom-line performance over the past three quarters. We have studied in detail the causes for the share loss across every dimension. The overwhelming driver is that despite moderately increasing our media on trademarked Pepsi over the past three years, our share of voice has fallen dramatically relative to our key competitor, who has substantially stepped up their media spending on colas over the past two years.","North American Beverage business, cola market share, share loss, media spend, key

PEP,2018,1,Indra K. Nooyi,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"To address this, we have allocated increased media to trademark Pepsi and we have heightened and elevated our brand communication, beginning with the launch of our new Pepsi Generations campaign. The campaign supports all the brands under the trademark Pepsi umbrella, and this will enable us to more effectively leverage the media investment across our full Pepsi portfolio. Importantly, we plan to substantially and sustainably support the campaign throughout the year while remaining disciplined on pricing.","Allocated media, brand communication, Pepsi Generations campaign, pricing discipline",PepsiCo Inc.
PEP,2018,1,Indra K.

Our enhanced water portfolio is performing well, with our premium LIFEWTR continuing to grow nicely as it enters its second year since its initial launch.

In January, we launched Mountain Dew Ice, a clear, lemon-lime-flavored Dew made with a splash of real juice with just 100 calories per 12-ounce serving, and it is off to a strong start. Additionally, we expect our summer 2018 limited-time offering of Mountain Dew Baja Blast to perform well, especially relative to our Dew summer 2017 LTO, which fell short of our expectations.","Mountain Dew, Gatorade, retail sales performance, innovations, Mountain Dew Ice",PepsiCo Inc.

Gatorade Zero will give our athletes more flexibility in combining hydration with other fuel sources to meet their overall sports hydration nutritional needs.

We are pleased with the 8% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and emerging markets as a group, which is an acceleration from the 6.5% growth we had in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw solid low single-digit growth in the U.K. and Spain, mid-single-digit growth in France, and high single-digit growth in Germany.

PEP,2018,1,Hugh F. Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I'll just provide a quick update on the outlook, and then we'll move to your questions. From a macro perspective, we remain pretty positive. We see continued broad-based GDP growth with developed markets stable and developing and emerging markets accelerating. In most of our key markets -- including the U.S. -- the picture is relatively positive with strong employment, consumer spending, and consumer sentiment data. However, within this broadly positive picture, there remains a risk of geopolitical volatility in certain markets.","macro perspective, GDP growth, developed markets, key markets, geopolitical volatility",PepsiCo Inc.
PEP,2018,1,Hugh F. Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"From an industry standpoint, we continue to see pretty challenging conditions, including dynamic retail and consumer landscapes, a very competitive environment, some currency volatility -- most recently in the Mexican peso, Russian ruble, Turkish lira, and Brazilian real -- and commodity inflation. As Indra mentioned, within our businesses, the majority of our divisions are performing well, and we expect NAB's results to improve as the year progresses.","challenging industry conditions, dynamic retail landscape, competitive environment, currency
volatility, commodity inflation",PepsiCo Inc.
PEP,2018,1,Hugh F. Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"So, putting this all together, our guidance for 2018 remains unchanged. Specifically, we expect organic revenue growth at least in line with our 2017 growth rate of 2.3%. As we move through the year, our expectation is that we will continue to see some level of gross margin compression from inflationary input costs. Normally, you would see the gross margin contraction offset with SG&A productivity, but as we shared with you in February, with the benefit of a lower effective tax rate in 2018, we're making investments to fortify the business as well as fund the front-line bonus, and these investments will largely offset the productivity-driven margin improvement. We expect our core effective tax rate to be in the low 20s, and we expect core earnings per share of $5.70, or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23.","gross margin compression, organic revenue growth, effective tax rate, core earnings per share,

PEP,2017,4,Hugh F. Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a discussion of our assessment of the impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform because it has implications for our 2018 financial outlook on a number of dimensions. From our perspective, it will affect five key areas. First, beginning in 2018, it will result in a lower tax rate on our U.S. earnings. Second, it imposes a one-time mandatory tax on our international accumulated earnings that existed as of year-end 2017, regardless of whether we choose to repatriate those earnings, but at a substantially lower rate that would have previously applied to actual repatriation. So, net, it provides a much more efficient framework in which to repatriate our international cash.","U.S. tax reform, financial outlook, tax rate, international accumulated earnings, repatriation",PepsiCo Inc.
PEP,2017,4,Hugh F. Johnston,Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,"Third, it decreases our net deferred tax liabilities, as those tax-deferred items are now expected to be taxed at a lower rate at the point they became taxable. Fourth, it will allow for much greater mobility of our international cash forward. Fifth, it will drive higher cash-on-cash returns on U.S. capital projects as capital spending for the next five years will be immediately deductible for tax purposes.","U.S.

During the 2021 third quarter, the Company procured additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States, South America and Asia in response to increased consumer demand. However, the Company continued to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA during the 2021 third quarter. In addition, the Company continued to experience additional supply chain challenges including freight inefficiencies, trucking availability, shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion, insufficient co-packing capacity and delays in receiving certain ingredients in the United States and EMEA.","Supply Chain, Demand, Aluminum Cans, COVID-19 Pandemic, Ingredients",Monster Beverage

In addition, the Company experienced increased ingredient and input costs including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees and secondary packaging materials and increased outbound freight costs.

MNST,2021,3,Rodney Sacks,Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer,"Additionally, the Company continue to experience multiple supply chain challenges in October, which adversely impacted sales. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holiday fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and you literally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.","Supply Chain, Sales, Selling Days, Product Launches, Price Increases",Monster Beverage

The company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's bottlers and distributors are operating, and the company's products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the company's bottlers and distributors have, in part, been negatively affected for varying periods of time. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record second quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Supply Chain, Safety, Well-being, Operations, Net Sales",Monster Beverage
MNST,2021,2,Rodney C. Sacks,Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer,"The company's supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company continues to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA, given the company's volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. The company is also experiencing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally. As a result, the company was unable to fully satisfy demand in the 2021 second quarter in the United States and EMEA. We expect such challenges to continue for the next few months. The company has taken steps to source additional quantities of aluminum cans from the United States, South America and Asia. The company has entered into new supply agreements with two new aluminum can suppliers in the United States, and which are expected to be operational in the 2021 fourth quarter. We expect deliveries of additional quantities of cans increasing sequentially during the latter part of the year.","Supply chain, shortages, aluminum can requirements, ingredient procurement, demand satisfaction,

We are planning to launch a number of additional products and product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year.","Pipeline Punch, Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Monster Dragon Gold, Asia-Pacific markets, new product

MNST,2021,2,Rodney C. Sacks,Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer,"We estimate that July 2021 sales to be approximately 1.8% higher than in July 2020. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2021 sales would have been comparable to the July 2020 sales. July 2021 had one less selling day than July 2020, which was 15.8% above July 2019, and which was 17.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Certain production facilities, mainly from the Coke bottlers in EMEA, in particular, delayed production from July to August 2021. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the company has not been able to fully satisfy demand in the United States and EMEA due to a shortage of aluminum cans, which adversely impacted July sales. Such shortage was exacerbated in July as can availability did not keep pace with increased demand during the summer months. Additional cans have been sourced from domestic and overseas suppliers with expected deliveries increasing sequentially during the latter half of the year. We are working to replenish system inventories in order to meet customer demand as soon as possible.","July 2021 sales, foreign currency adjusted basis, selling days, production facilities, aluminum can

Our depletions remain solid as do our measured market data, as previously mentioned on this call. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays for, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.","ingredients, depletions, measured market data, selling days, new product launches",Monster Beverage

In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses, and shipment facilities, and bottlers and distributors are all operating.

In limited countries, the operations of our bottlers and distributors have been more affected. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on our net and gross sales for the 2020 second quarter in part due to certain of our bottlers and distributors reducing their inventory levels.

The decrease was largely due to the reduction of sales in EMEA during the quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $18.2 million in the 2020 second quarter.

We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern.

MNST,2019,4,Rodney C. Sacks,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2019 compared to December 2018 Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 16.9% to 33.5% in Brazil from 19.6% to 27.4% and in Chile from 34.9% to 39.8%.

MNST,2019,4,Rodney C. Sacks,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,In January 2020 Monster Energy was launched by the Coca-Cola Bottler in Israel. We continued the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Mango Loco in December. We also continued Ultra White's expansion from September's launch to further provide a broad portfolio with strong taste experiences for Indian consumers. The Monster range continued to build significant active distribution increases across China in the 2019 fourth quarter versus a year ago but the situation in China is currently challenging. I wanted to provide an update regarding the recent coronavirus or COVID-19 outbreak. First of all our number one priority is the safety of our employees in China. We are thinking of everyone who has been affected by coronavirus and we continue to monitor the situation closely. In addition to having employees in China we and our suppliers currently globally source certain ingredients from third-party manufacturers in Wuhan and other parts of China. We also manufacture finished goods through third-party bottlers and co-packers in China.,"Monster, Israel, India, China, COVID-19",Monster Beverage
MNST,2019,4,Rodney C. Sacks,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,The coronavirus outbreak could adversely affect our business and cause disruptions internationally due to the closure or suspension of activities at such third-party manufacturers as well as within China at our co-packing facilities and our China office. Ingredient sourcing delays could also interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products internationally. In addition the outbreak together within the accompanying special government measures could adversely affect the growth of our business in China and affect demand for our products. However it's too early to determine what impact it will have on our global supply chain and our operations. As I've said before our first priority is employee safety and we are continuing to monitor the situation closely. I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. VPX the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising. VPX filed a trademark lawsuit in March 2019 against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and another lawsuit suit in August 2019 against Monster alleging a host of legal challenges including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX.,"coronavirus, COVID-19, business, supply chain, operations, litigation, Vital

MNST,2019,4,Rodney C. Sacks,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,These proceedings are ongoing. In October 2019 the U.S. District Court denied VPX's motion for a preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In its decision the court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and failed to establish it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims. In October 2019 VPX announced its intention to launch its own line of Reign-branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. Later that month we filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and prevent VPX from infringing Monster's trademark rights in this way. In November 2019 VPX stipulated that I would refrain from launching such products until the district judge entered a final order on the preliminary injunction motion. In January 2020 the magistrate judge issued a reported recommendation that an injunction be granted in Monster's favor. Motions for summary judgment have been filed by Monster in this proceeding and which are currently pending.,"Reign Total Body Fuel, trademark lawsuit, preliminary injunction, motion for a preliminary

MNST,2019,4,Rodney C. Sacks,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,January 2020 had the same number of selling days than in January 2019. In this regard we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days days of the week in which holidays fall timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion I'd like to summarize some recent positive points.,"January 2020 sales, selling days, holidays, new product launches, price increases and promotions,

MNST,2019,4,Rodney C.

New additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year as well as our innovation pipeline in 2020. We're encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno thermogenic fuel high-performance energy drinks not only within the U.S. but also internationally.

Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve at an increasing pace. And we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the third quarter of 2019 net sales were $1.13 billion up 11.6% from $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements net sales for the quarter would have been up 12.8%. The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States portion of our products effective November 1 2018.,"consumer beverage preferences, tastes, innovation, net sales, foreign currency movements",Monster Beverage
MNST,2019,3,Hilton Schlosberg,Chief Financial Officer,Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements net sales for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 14.6%. Turning now to gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the 2019 third quarter was 59.4% compared with 59.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset by price increases as well as reduced input costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 4.1% in the 2018 third quarter. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.2% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter in 2018.

MNST,2019,3,Hilton Schlosberg,Chief Financial Officer,Payroll costs increased $10.4 million primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $16 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $14.1 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate increased from 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter to 25% in the 2019 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions as well as a decrease in the equity compensation deduction. In addition the comparative effective tax rate for the 2018 third quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit. Net income was $298.9 million in the 2019 third quarter compared to net income of $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter an increase of 11.6%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 third quarter increased 14% to $0.55 from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2018. Now we turn to The Coca-Cola Company transition update. In the third quarter of 2019 Monster Energy was launched by or transition to Coke bottlers in the Dominican Republic El Salvador and Honduras. We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator our affordable energy brand in the third quarter of 2019 in Botswana and in Slovakia. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019.

MNST,2019,3,Hilton Schlosberg,Chief Financial Officer,The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. And now we turn to EMEA.

In this regard we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days days of the week in which holidays fall timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and you need to actually determine their production schedules which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.,"Gross sales, Sales, Foreign currency movements, Selling days, Production schedules",Monster Beverage

Net and gross sales for the three months ended December 31, 2018, were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the third quarter of 2018 due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 2018, which affected our fourth quarter.

The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in input -- certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; geographical sales mix as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales, our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins; domestic product sales mix; and the 8.5 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606.

MNST,2018,3,Rodney Cyril Sacks,Chairman & CEO,"Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to US taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter.","Losses in China, Effective Tax Rate, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Domestic Production Deduction,

Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 second quarter, as compared to 3% in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of $10.7 million, largely due to higher carrier cost contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.4%, compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago.

Collectively, these actions enabled us to fully offset inflation and currency headwinds in 2022 on a dollar basis.","Revenue growth management, Profitability, Gross margin, Inflation, Currency headwinds",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2022,4,Mike Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Recently, market prices of some inputs have begun to ease, although they remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. While we're encouraged by this, it will take time for these benefits to work through our contracts and flow through the P&L. Nevertheless, we'll continue to leverage our scale to improve efficiency and reduce costs. At the same time, we expect our revenue management efforts will continue to positively impact this year.","Easing of market prices, Benefits working through contracts, Improving efficiency, Reducing costs,

At the midpoint of our 2023 guidance range, we plan to improve operating margin by approximately 80 basis points. With incremental headwinds below the line, this translates to 2% to 6% growth in earnings per share in 2023.

KMB,2021,4,Mike Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In 2021, we continue to execute our strategy to elevate our categories and expand our markets.

Before we get to your questions, I'd like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we're taking in response to this dynamic and challenging macro environment. Organic sales were strong of 4% in the quarter and included the impact of pricing actions implemented in the second and third quarters. In North America Personal Care organic sales were, up 11%, driven by mid single-digit increases in both net selling price and volume.","Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2021,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In D&E markets personal care, organic sales were up 7% organic sales increased double digits in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Eastern Europe and South Africa. Our top line performance was strong despite the resurgence of COVID, which impacted growth in ASEAN, Latin American and KC Professional. Our market positions remain strong and are improving reflecting strong innovation and excellent commercial execution in nearly all key markets.

KMB,2021,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"We also continue to focus on cost with our teams delivering solid savings of $150 million in the quarter. In addition, we reduced between the line spending.

KMB,2021,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"I'd like to highlight the effect of three areas of volatility that are most impacting our business. First, as we noted in July and on the basis of external forecast we had expected, commodity prices to ease in the second half of 2021 instead prices for resin and pulp increased further in the third quarter and are now expected to stabilize at a meaningfully higher level than our prior estimate.","Earnings, Commodity Prices, Volatility, Business Impact, External Forecast",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2021,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Second, a tight US labor market and disruption in domestic and international transportation markets are having an elevated impact on our supply chain as we work to get our products to the shelf and meet consumer demand.","Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2021,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Third, energy cost were up dramatically in Europe, where natural gas prices have risen as high as 6 times year-ago levels. Energy prices in North America are also up sharply, although not to the same extent.","Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2021,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"As a result, our margins are down -- but we're down with declines only partially mitigated by the actions we've taken to-date. We're not pleased with our results and we're taking further action to mitigate the impact of higher input and labor costs. These steps include further pricing actions, additional initiatives to ensure we achieve our cost savings goals, and tightening discretionary spending. At the same time, we remain committed to investing in our brands and commercial capabilities. While we expect to see some benefit from these actions in 2021, we have further reduced our outlook for the year. This reflects our third quarter performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter.","Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2021,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"And while we're not ready to call our outlook for 2022, I will offer perspective on key variables that will affect our plan next year. First, we continue to build top line momentum. In addition, our pricing actions, brand investment and commercial program should provide further benefit in 2022. Second, some discrete headwinds we faced this year will be behind us. This includes the US winter storm and presumably consumer tissue destocking. Third, some headwinds we faced this year may become more persistent, we're now expecting further inflation on several key commodities, we're also expecting continued tightness in the labor and transportation markets, which will continue to impact our global supply chain all the way to our customers.","Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2021,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In addition, the going forward impact of COVID on both demand and supply remains very unpredictable.

KMB,2021,2,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Clearly our results did not turn out as we expected and we knew it was a tough comp given our strong growth and record profitability in the year ago quarter. Now while we expected volatility this year, the external environment has proven to be even more volatile than our expectation at the beginning of the year and versus our April update. Since we spoke in April, commodity inflation has spiked higher and our supply chain has been challenged. These dynamics are impacting us and more broadly the industry.","Financial Outlook, External Environment, Commodity Inflation, Supply Chain, Industry Dynamics",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2021,2,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"We're also navigating historic levels of demand volatility in Consumer Tissue. Last year, we worked really hard to support our consumers and our customers as demand increased at a record pace. While we expect the category to retract this year that decline has meaningfully outpaced our expectation. This has been driven by reduced at-home consumption due to increased mobility and destocking of both consumer pantries and retailer inventory.","Financial Outlook, Consumer Tissue, Demand Volatility, At-Home Consumption, Retail Inventory",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2021,2,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Consumer Tissue has historically been very stable and we expect demand to normalize over time. We remain confident in our brand fundamentals, even as we acknowledge that the short-term tissue outlook has been difficult to call. We've taken decisive action to offset the impact of raw material inflation. We have announced pricing in key markets around the world.

KMB,2021,2,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"We've also taken prudent steps to control and reduce discretionary spend across the business. We expect this to be reflected in our results as we continue to implement these actions. We view this level of input cost inflation and the COVID driven demand volatility to be discrete issue. We will continue to take appropriate action to reduce the impact of volatility over time. At the same time, we remain confident and committed to our approach to building brands.

KMB,2021,2,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"You can see this in our second quarter results broadly across Personal Care and especially in D&E markets. Excluding North American Consumer Tissue, our organic sales were up 4%. Personal Care organic sales were up 6% globally, driven by a 4% volume increase. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were up 8% with very strong market share performance, including in China, Brazil throughout Eastern Europe, India, Peru and South Africa. We have recently captured number one diaper share positions in China and Brazil, which reflects the strength of our brand fundamentals with consumers.","Personal Care, D&E Markets, Organic Sales, Brand Fundamentals, Market Share Performance",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2021,2,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Importantly, we're starting to see green shoots in KC Professional. The business grew year-over-year and sequentially as we saw strength in international markets and positive trends in washroom products. As more companies transition back to in-person environments, we expect KCP momentum to improve in the back half.

KMB,2021,1,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Okay. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start the call today with a few brief remarks. Our first quarter results and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, faster than expected consumer tissue destocking and a sharp rise in input costs. While I'm not pleased with the results and our outlook, we're taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face. We'll continue to invest in our brands and commercial capability to ensure we're able to grow both in the near-term and in the long-term. We gain market share in 2020 and our shares are off to a good start this year with strong gains in many key markets.","Business Results, Supply Chain Disruption, Consumer Tissue Destocking, Input Costs, Brand

We've done this successfully in past commodity cycles and we expect to do this again now. I remain confident in the underlying health of our brands and in our growth strategies.

KMB,2020,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Let me start with the headlines for the full year results. We delivered strong top and bottom line growth and exceeded our previous outlook. We significantly increased our brand and capability investments and improved our market shares. We generated excellent cost savings and cash flow, and we returned significant cash to shareholders.","Strong Growth, Brand Investments, Market Shares, Cost Savings, Cash Flow",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Now let's cover the details of our results, starting with sales. Full year net sales were $19.1 billion. That's up 4% year-on-year and included a 2 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales grew 6%, with healthy underlying performance and increased demand related to COVID-19. Volumes were up 4%, and net selling prices and product mix each increased 1%. Mike is going to provide some more color on our top line and market share performance in just a few minutes.","Sales, Net Sales, Currency Rates, Organic Sales, Volumes",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Moving on to profitability. Full year adjusted gross margin was 37.1%, up 210 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 10%. We generated $575 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs. That was well above our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October. For 2021, we're targeting $400 million to $460 million in total cost savings.","Profitability, Adjusted Gross Margin, Cost Savings, FORCE Programs, Restructuring Programs",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Commodities were favorable by $175 million in 2020 although they turned inflationary in the fourth quarter. We're planning for commodity inflation of $450 million to $600 million in 2021. Costs are projected to increase broadly in most areas, including pulp and recycled fiber, resins, superabsorbent and distribution expenses. Other manufacturing costs were higher in 2020, including costs related to COVID-19. Foreign currencies were also a headwind, reducing operating profit at a high-single digit rate.","Commodities, Inflation, Costs, Manufacturing Costs, Foreign Currencies",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Moving further down the P&L, between the line spending was up 110 basis points as a percent of sales. That was driven by advertising, which was up 90 basis points. SG&A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation, along with capability building investments. Adjusted operating margin was 18.7%, up 90 basis points, and adjusted operating profit grew 9%. In terms of Company profitability for 2021, the midpoint of our planning assumptions implies a 70 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin. And while there are a number of moving pieces, it's likely that adjusted gross margin will be down somewhat more than that.","Moving Down P&L, Advertising, SG&A Spending, Capability Building Investments, Company
Profitability",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning back to 2020 results. Full year adjusted earnings per share were $7.74, up 12%. Our October guidance was for earnings of $7.50 to $7.65. In addition to the strong growth in adjusted operating profit, the bottom line benefited from higher equity income, a lower share count and a slight decline in adjusted effective tax rate.","Strong Growth, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Operating Profit, Equity Income, Adjusted
Effective Tax Rate",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Now let's turn to cash flow [Technical Issues] Cash provided by operations was an all-time record $3.7 billion, up $1 billion year-on-year, reflecting outstanding working capital performance and strong earnings. Cash flow is expected to be down year-on-year in 2021, driven by higher cash taxes and working capital. Nonetheless, cash flow should remain strong and well above 2019's level. Capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, in line with plan and the prior year. We plan to spend between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2021, including activity for our restructuring program and a pickup in growth projects. Based on an initial outlook at longer-term opportunities, we believe spending will be elevated again in 2022.","Cash Flow, Cash Provided by Operations, Capital Spending, Working Capital, Restructuring Program",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.15 billion. That's the 10th consecutive year we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. We expect to return a similar level of cash to shareholders in 2021, and as mentioned in the earnings release, our Board has already approved our 49th consecutive annual dividend increase and authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program.","Capital Allocation, Dividends, Share Repurchases, Cash Returned to Shareholders, Board Approval",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program. We continue to make significant progress as we head into the last year of this program. We're about 85% to 90% through the total pre-tax charges, which we've increased somewhat to reflect delays as a result of COVID-19 and costs for additional savings opportunities. So far, we've generated $420 million of savings and expect to achieve between $540 million and $560 million of savings by the end of 2021. Our original savings estimate was $500 million to $550 million.","Restructuring Program, Pre-Tax Charges, Savings, COVID-19, Costs for Additional Savings

KMB,2020,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Overall, it was an excellent year financially, while we invested more in the business for the long term and navigated the COVID-19 environment.","Excellent Year Financially, Investment for Long Term, COVID-19 Environment",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Hey, let me begin by saying that I'm very proud of our KC team and our accomplishments in 2020. We worked tirelessly to protect the health and safety of each other by setting and maintaining strict safety protocols, all of which are in place today. We kept our global supply chain running and safely served the needs of our consumers and customers, and in many cases, delivering record output. At the same time, we delivered healthy top line growth across our portfolio, gained market share, invested to strengthen long-term brand fundamentals and delivered strong financial results.","Safety Protocols, Global Supply Chain, Consumers and Customers, Top Line Growth, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Looking more closely at our business segments, we saw excellent performance in Personal Care, with 5% organic sales growth and strong share performance. In North America, organic sales rose 6%, driven by broad-based growth in baby and child care. Our market shares were up nicely on both Huggies diapers and GoodNites youth pants. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were also up 6% despite volatile market conditions. More specifically, Personal Care organic sales were up double digits in China, India and South Africa; up high single digits in Eastern Europe; and up low-single digits in Latin America. We also improved our share positions in many D&E markets.","Personal Care, Organic Sales Growth, Share Performance, North America, Market Shares",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Looking at our other segments. Organic sales were up 13% in Consumer Tissue and down 7% in K-C Professional. As expected, both businesses experienced the effect of COVID-19 and the shift to more consumers working from home. We're pleased with how our K-C team managed through that volatility. To meet elevated demand in Consumer Tissue, we significantly reduced our SKU count and leveraged our global supply network to increase production, including support from KCP. We continue to focus on category expanding and brand building programs while improving our market execution. Those actions helped us gain market share for Kleenex facial tissue in North America and Europe.","Consumer Tissue, Organic Sales Growth, K-C Professional, COVID-19, Market Execution",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In KCP, where the washroom category continues to be a significant part of our business, we made good progress pivoting to growth opportunities in other parts of the business, including in wipers and safety products. Sales of those products were up double digits in North America. Importantly, we grew or maintained market share in approximately 60% of the 80 key cohorts that we track. I'm pleased to see our brands winning in the marketplace.","KCP, Washroom Category, Growth Opportunities, Safety Products, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Overall, our results were strong, and I'm encouraged by the way we executed in 2020.","Strong Results, Execution",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Next, I'll turn to our outlook for 2021. We expect a more challenging environment, especially compared to last year. More specifically, we expect some of the net benefit from COVID dynamics, including higher consumer demand, to reverse. In addition, commodity costs are rising globally, and we're also reflecting our latest view on economic conditions and birth rate trends. Despite these factors, we're confident in our ability to deliver top line growth and expect to strengthen our market positions and improve our Company for long-term value creation. Our plans call for total sales growth of 4% to 6% in 2021, and that includes 2 points from the Softex acquisition and a 1 to 2 point benefit from currencies.","Outlook for 2021, Challenging Environment, Net Benefit from COVID Dynamics, Commodity Costs,

KMB,2020,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"We expect to grow organic sales 1% to 2%. We plan to leverage and scale our brand-building capabilities and investments that we've made over the past two years. We have a healthy innovation pipeline, including near-term launches for Huggies in North America, China, Eastern Europe and Latin America, and we've also upgraded products for our global Kotex brand in several markets. We expect to benefit from selective pricing actions and other revenue management programs, but we're not currently planning for broad-based list price increases. And we'll continue to make capability and technology investments to drive long-term success.","Organic Sales Growth, Brand Building Capabilities, Innovation Pipeline, Selective Pricing Actions,

KMB,2020,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"On advertising, spending should be similar to 2020 levels, and this reflects the increases we made over the last two years and confidence in the strong ROIs from digital. We believe this level of investment is sufficient to support our growth plans in the current environment.","Advertising Spending, ROIs from Digital, Growth Plans",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of $7.75 to $8. That's even to up 3% year-on-year. We're focused on delivering our annual plan, while managing the quarter-to-quarter volatility that could be higher than normal in this environment.","Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Target, Year-On-Year Growth, Quarter-To-Quarter Volatility",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Finally, because of the different COVID dynamics in 2020 and 2021, we think it is relevant to consider our performance over both years. So on that basis, using the midpoint of our 2021 outlook, we're projecting to grow organic sales approximately 4% and to increase adjusted earnings per share 7% on average over that two-year period. Those growth rates are slightly above our medium-term objectives.","Organic Sales Growth, Adjusted Earnings Per Share Growth, Two-Year Period, COVID Dynamics, Medium-

KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 3% with good underlying momentum and benefits from increased demand related to COVID-19. We significantly increased our growth investments and improved our market positions. We had another strong quarter of achieving cost savings and returning cash to shareholders. And finally, while earnings were down as expected, we are increasing our full-year outlook.","Growth, Brands, Market Positions, Company, Shareholder Value",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Now let's look at the details of our results, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.7 billion. That's up 1% from year ago and includes a two-point drag from currency rates. Volumes were up 2% and the combined impact of changes in net selling prices and product mix increased sales by 1%. By segment, organic sales rose 10% in Consumer Tissue and 5% in Personal Care, but declined 15% in K-C Professional.","Growth, Sales, Volumes, Currency Rates, Segments",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Mike will talk more about our top-line and our market share performance in just a few minutes. Moving on to profitability. Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.2%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 2%. We had excellent cost savings performance in the quarter. Combined savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs totaled $140 million, including continued strong productivity improvements.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,Commodities were a benefit of $25 million in the quarter driven by pulp and other raw materials. Other manufacturing costs were higher year-on-year that included incremental costs related to COVID-19. Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit by a high single digit rate in the quarter.,"Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,Moving further down the P&L. Between the lines spending was 18.9% of sales. That's up 180 basis points and driven by a big step up in digital advertising. G&A also increased including capability-building investments and higher incentive compensation expenses. We expect between the lines spending will rise further sequentially in the fourth quarter.,"Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Our SG&A spending is typically high in the fourth quarter and this year we'll also have project activities that were temporarily delayed because of COVID-19. All in all, for the fourth quarter-for the third quarter, sorry, adjusted operating profit was down 6% and operating margin was 17.2%, down 130 basis points versus year ago.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"By segment, operating margins were up in Consumer Tissue and Healthy and Personal Care. K-C Professional margins were down significantly, including an approximate 600 basis-point drag from fixed costs under absorption. On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 in the quarter, compared to $1.84 in the year-ago period.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $559 million compared to $886 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was as expected and driven by the timing of tax payments and higher working capital. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Third quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $560 million. And for the full year, we expect the total will be $2.15 billion.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"So let me now turn to the full year. The overall headline is that we're raising our top and bottom-line outlook. On the top-line, we now expect organic sales growth of 5% compared to our prior target of 4% to 5%. Through nine months, organic sales are up nearly 6% and we expect a solid fourth quarter. On average, we expect slightly less headwinds from currency rates than previously anticipated.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"In addition, we'll begin consolidating the Softex Indonesia business into our results on November 1 on a one-month lag. All in all, we expect net sales will grow 2% to 3% this year. That's one point better than our previous estimate. On the bottom-line, our new outlook is for adjusted earnings per share of $7.50 to $7.65. That represents year-on-year growth of 9% to 11%.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Our prior outlook was for adjusted EPS of $7.40 to $7.60. The increase in our outlook is driven by improved top line, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense and other manufacturing costs. Overall, I'm encouraged that we're improving our near-term outlook and investing significantly in the business for longer-term growth.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reinforcing that we remain focused on three near-term priorities that we established since the outbreak of COVID-19. First, we're focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and our consumers. Second, we're proactively managing our supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products. And third, we're prudently managing the business through near-term volatility, while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly Clark.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Our 40,000 employees continue to do heroic work in this COVID environment. Our supply chain operations have remained online with strong productivity gains and fewer COVID-related disruptions over the last three months. The environment is still dynamic and we're closely monitoring virus hotspots. And thus far, our supply chain has been resilient and our teams have done a great job overcoming daily challenges.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Now turn to our results focusing on organic sales category conditions and our market shares. As Maria mentioned, organic sales increased 3% in the quarter. In North American consumer products, organics sales rose 8%. Now within that Personal Care grew 6% driven by broad-based volume growth in baby and child care. We improved our market shares on diapers, baby wipes, and in child care. In late July, we launched Pull-Ups New Leaf training pants which features super-soft natural materials and is our most premium training pants.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"This is another example of our elevate the core strategy and action. And New Leaf is off to a very good start. In North American consumer tissue, organic sales increased to 11% and that reflects strong demand due to the COVID-19 work from home environment and strong momentum on Kleenex facial tissue. Bathroom tissue shipments benefited from our efforts to restore customer inventory levels.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In the fourth quarter, we expect more benefit from those efforts and from people continuing to spend more time at home. Our market share performance in North American consumer products was strong in the third quarter; shares were upper even in six of eight categories. Turning to K-C Professional North America, organic sales declined 15%. Sales were down about 35% in washroom products. And as you'd expect, the category has been significantly impacted. There are fewer people working in offices and lower levels of business activity, including in travel and lodging.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Sales were a bit better in September, but we're planning for only a modest near-term improvement in the environment. On the other hand, KCP sales were up double digits in wipers, safety and other products. Our efforts to expand our face mask business by leveraging our superior non-wovens technology is off to a good start. We're also expanding our wipers line-up with Scott 24-Hour, which delivers long-lasting surface protection from bacteria.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Moving to D&E markets, organic sales were up 2% that was driven by 7% growth in Personal Care. In terms of key personal care markets, organic sales were up mid-teens in China, mid-single digits in both Latin America and Eastern Europe and strong double-digits in India. Organic sales were down mid-single digits in ASEAN. We also improved our market shares in many countries in the quarter. And that includes Brazil, China, throughout Eastern Europe, India, and Peru.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"While category conditions remain difficult in many D&E countries, government restrictions on social mobility and store operations have eased somewhat since the last quarter. Finally, in developed markets, organic sales were up 3% driven by strong growth in consumer tissue. Looking ahead, we're launching Kleenex Proactive Care in the UK and other markets in EMEA. This lineup includes hand towels, anti-bacterial hand and face wipes, sanitizing gel, and face masks.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Now in terms of market share performance, we continue to make good progress. We're on track to grow or maintain share in approximately 60% of the 80 category/country combinations that we track. This is a result of higher investment levels, innovations, and strong in-market executions. Our capabilities are driving our results and our investments are working hard for us. Through nine months, I'm very encouraged with our performance, how we're navigating this environment and how our teams are taking care of each other and our customers.","Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Before closing, I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition of Softex. This transaction is a strong strategic fit with our focus on accelerating growth in personal care in D&E markets. Softex expands our presence in a high-growth market where we had limited exposure. The diaper market in Indonesia is already the sixth largest in the world, and that's projected to nearly triple in size over the next decade. Our Softex team has built a strong business with deep local market knowledge, excellent brands and market positions and strong profitability.","Growth, Strategic Fit, Market Expansion, Local Market Knowledge, Profitability",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,3,Michael D.

In conclusion, we're managing through the COVID environment safely and effectively. We remain optimistic about our opportunities to generate long-term growth and create shareholder value. We're investing in our brands and improving our market positions. We are raising our full-year outlook and are on track to achieve excellent financial results.

We had outstanding cost savings performance in the quarter. Combined savings from our FORCE and restructuring program totaled $175 million, including strong productivity improvements. We are now targeting full year cost savings of $510 million to $560 million. That's up nicely compared to our original range of $425 million to $500 million. Commodities were a benefit of $80 million in the quarter driven by pulp. We now expect full year commodity deflation of $150 million to $250 million. On average that's $75 million better than our original outlook.","Growth, Cost Savings, Profitability, Commodities, Target",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"On the other hand, foreign currencies were a headwind in the quarter, reducing our operating profit by a high single-digit rate. For the full year, currency effects are expected to be a high single-digit drag on operating profit. Versus our original plan, the incremental currency headwinds are about twice the benefit of the improved commodity outlook. Other manufacturing costs were also higher year-on-year. For the full year, these costs are expected to increase more than we originally planned. That's due to incremental expenses related to COVID-19 partially offset by improved fixed cost absorption.","Growth, Currency Effects, Manufacturing Costs, Commodity Outlook, COVID-19 Expenses",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Moving further down the P&L. Between the lines spending was up 40 basis points as a percent of sales, driven by a nice pickup in digital advertising. All-in-all, adjusted operating profit was up 28%. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, up 470 basis points versus year ago. Margins were up in all three business segments with significant improvement in consumer tissue. Consumer tissue margins included an approximate 175 basis point benefit from improved fixed cost absorption. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were a record $2.20, up 32% year-on-year.","Growth, Digital Advertising, Margins, Segments, Earnings Per Share",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was an all-time record of nearly $1.6 billion, compared to $609 million in the year ago quarter. The increase was driven by unusually strong working capital benefits, higher earnings and a temporary delay in tax payments. While cash flow is expected to decline in the back half of the year, we expect full year cash flow will be up very nicely year-on-year.","Cash Flow, Capital Efficiency, Working Capital, Tax Payments, Full Year",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Second quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled about $400 million. That was lower than normal because of our decision to temporarily suspend share repurchases for most of the second quarter. As we mentioned in this morning's news release, we will be restarting our share repurchase program beginning tomorrow. All in all, we delivered very good results across the board, while continuing to invest for future success.","Dividends, Share Repurchases, Second Quarter, Suspension, Future Success",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Maria. Good morning everyone. I really want to wish you and your family's good health and safety. I'll begin by commenting on how we're operating in the current environment and then I'll turn to our results and the outlook. Now, since the outbreak of COVID-19, Kimberly Clark has taken decisive action to manage our business effectively through this crisis. Our key operating priorities remain as follows. First and foremost, we are focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and our consumers; second, we're proactively managing our global supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products and third, we're prudently managing the business through near-term volatility, while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly Clark.","Health and Safety, Operating Priorities, Supply Chain Management, Long-Term Health, Crisis

KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"I'm really proud of how our 40,000 employees are managing through the challenges we're facing every day. Our global supply chain organization led by our frontline manufacturing employees is doing an outstanding job keeping our supply chain rolling. We have not experienced material impact even as we've had disruptions in several markets with elevated infection rates. Despite the tough environment, our teams continue to deliver strong cost savings and productivity improvements. While much of our attention has been on the near term, we are continuing to execute our longer-term strategies.","Employee Management, Supply Chain Organization, Cost Savings, Productivity Improvements, Longer-

KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Our teams pivoted rapidly to pursue new growth opportunities, that have been created in the pandemic environment and this includes opportunities to better meet consumer and end-user needs around health, wellness and protection, both in home and in the workplace. It also includes opportunities to accelerate e-commerce and digital as consumers change how they engage with our brands. Now, I'd like to make a few comments about our results. As Maria mentioned, organic sales increased 4% in the quarter.","Growth Opportunities, Consumer Needs, E-Commerce, Digital Engagement, Quarterly Results",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In North American consumer products, organic sales were up 12%. Now within that personal care rose 5% and that was driven by ongoing momentum on premium-tier Huggies, child care and baby wipes. In North American consumer tissue organic, sales increased 22%. Category demand was strong reflecting increased at-home consumption and some continued consumer stock-up in bath tissue. Category growth moderated in the latter part of the quarter. Shipments exceeded category demand especially in bath tissue as we work 24/7 to restore customer inventory levels."," Huggies,  Child Care,  Baby Wipes,  North American Consumer Products,  Category

KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Turning to K-C Professional in North America, organic sales declined 3% and volumes fell 9%. This decline reflects the challenging environment. And I'll note that we experienced strong shipments early in the quarter which included benefits from higher-than-normal customer orders in late March that were ultimately fulfilled in April. Now, by product category, second quarter volumes were down about 20% in washroom, down double digits in safety. Now volume was up double digits in wipers and other products."," Sales decline,  Volumes fell,  Challenging environment,  Strong shipments,  Product

KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Moving to D&E markets, sales were down 3%, driven primarily by K-C Professional. Personal care organic sales in D&E were up 2%. Now in key personal care markets, organic sales were up mid-teens in China and up double digits in India. In Eastern Europe, organic sales were up slightly, although results were impacted by some destocking and the impact of economic lockdowns. In Latin America, organic sales fell low single digits despite favorable pricing in Argentina. Category demand in many D&E countries has been impacted by a drop in consumer purchasing power and government restrictions on social mobility and store operations."," Sales decline,  K-C Professional,  Personal care organic sales,  Key personal care

KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"In developed markets, organic sales were up 3%, driven by strong growth in consumer tissue. Now, as you know, we're also very focused on improving our market positions and we're making good progress. Overall, we're growing or maintaining market share in approximately 60% of our 80 category/country combinations that we track. In North American consumer products market shares are up or even in five of eight product categories. In D&E markets shares were up in Eastern Europe up or even in China and somewhat mixed in Latin America. In developed markets shares were up in South Korea and the U.K."," Organic sales,  Consumer tissue,  Market positions,  Market share,  Product

KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"So to summarize our first half, I'm very encouraged by our progress. We're delivering strong financial results. We're strengthening our market positions and we're managing through this crisis safely and effectively. Now I'll address the outlook. The duration and impact of COVID-19 on our business remains unclear and there continues to be uncertainty in the environment.

KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Compared to our original plan we're raising our outlook for both organic sales and earnings. We're also increasing growth investment, primarily in digital advertising. On the top line we're targeting organic sales growth of 4% to 5% which is above our original plan of 2%. And this increase reflects a combination of improved underlying brand performance and higher demand driven by COVID."," Outlook,  Organic sales growth,  Earnings,  Growth investment,  Digital
advertising",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"A few additional thoughts about our second half organic outlook, we have good underlying momentum and we'll continue to support our brands with strong advertising and innovation. New innovation includes launches on Pull-Ups in North America and feminine care in Eastern Europe Brazil and ASEAN.

KMB,2020,2,Michael Hsu,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"We expect to continue facing challenging conditions in K-C Professional and in consumer categories in some D&E markets. We also expect to see additional consumer destocking in the second half. On the bottom line our revised outlook is adjusted earnings per share of $7.40 to $7.60. That's up 7% to 10% year-on-year compared to our original plan of $7.10 to $7.35. While, we're increasing our outlook we'll also invest more in our brands and capabilities. We temporarily paused some investment in the second quarter and now plan to restore and further increase investment this year.

We have three key operating priorities. Priority number one, protect the health and safety of our employees and our consumers. Throughout our 148-year history, this has never been more important than right now. We've taken aggressive action to protect our employees around the world, no matter where they work, that includes implementing extensive sanitization, quarantine and social distance protocols in our manufacturing facilities, work from home policies and of course, travel restrictions.

Our supply chain teams are meeting multiple times each day to effectively navigate the dynamic environment. They're doing a great job and keeping our global supply chain largely operational, in many cases delivering record output. We're running our assets flat out and greatly simplifying our assortment to improve product availability. We're working with raw material suppliers and distribution partners to ensure continuity and maximize deliveries. In some cases, we are incurring additional cost to keep the supply chain rolling. We have experienced some disruption, including temporary manufacturing slowdowns and shutdowns, but none have had material impact to date.

We'll continue to invest in our products, our brands and our commercial capabilities to maintain the near-term health of our business and position us for long-term success.

KMB,2020,1,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Overall, first quarter results reflect both significant volume increases from consumer stock-up as well as excellent execution by our teams.

KMB,2020,1,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Let me cover some of the details of our results. First quarter net sales were $5 billion, that's up 8% year-on-year. Organic sales increased 11%, while currencies were a 2-point drag. Volumes were up 8%, including significant shipments to support consumer stock-up related to the COVID-19 outbreak. That stock-up occurred in all major geographies and benefited all three business segments, in particular, consumer tissue. In addition, we were off to an excellent start to the year prior to the outbreak with good performance in several areas, that included premium-tier Huggies diapers and adult care in North America; personal care in Asia broadly, including China and also in Eastern Europe. Net selling prices in the quarter were up 1%, driven by increases taken last year. Overall, the pricing and promotion environment remained broadly constructive in the third quarter.

In North American consumer products, our first quarter market shares were up or even in 5 of 8 categories year-on-year, and up or even in 6 of 8 categories sequentially. In key D&E markets in personal care, market shares were up or even year-on-year in Eastern Europe, in China and in most categories in Brazil.

KMB,2020,1,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning back to the financials. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 37.2%, up 370 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 20%. We had a strong quarter on cost savings with total savings of $125 million from our FORCE and restructuring programs. Commodities were a benefit of $115 million, somewhat better than we expected.

KMB,2020,1,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Now let's turn to cash flow restructuring in the balance sheet. Cash provided by operations was strong at $704 million compared to a soft quarter last year of $317 million. The year-on-year increase was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. Capital spending was $352 million in the quarter, including significant activity related to our restructuring. Looking ahead, some of our near-term capital projects and restructuring activities will be temporarily delayed or reprioritized because of the complexities of managing in the current environment. We now expect that charges for our restructuring program will continue into 2021, rather than wrapping up at the end of this year. We also expect the charges for the total program will be toward the high end of our previous estimate. We expect that total restructuring savings will be consistent with our previous estimate. Although it is possible that we won't hit our full target until sometime in 2022.

It is also our intention to maintain our single A credit rating through this temporary period of uncertainty. We executed two long-term debt transactions in the quarter. The first was $500 million 30-year bond offering that essentially pre-funded the $500 million of notes that will come due in August. In late March, we executed a second transaction, this one, a $750 million 10-year bond offering.

KMB,2020,1,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"I'll finish with some perspectives on the currency and commodity markets. We originally expected that currencies would reduce our net sales by 1 point this year. Using first quarter actuals and forward rates at the end of March, the headwind would be approximately 4% and rates remain volatile on a daily basis. For your benefit, on a historical basis, the currency impact on our operating profit, taking into account both translation and transaction effects has typically been two to three times the impact on our sales. In addition, our equity affiliate K-C de Mexico is facing many of the same uncertainties that we are, including a much weaker Mexican peso. Improving net realized revenue remains one of our strategies to offset currency headwinds. However, in this environment, much of new incremental price realization will occur -- how much, I'm sorry, much incremental price realization will occur in the near term is more uncertain than normal."," Currency impact,  Commodity markets,  Net sales,  Operating profit,  Equity

KMB,2020,1,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"On the commodity front, forward-looking trends look favorable, other markets remain volatile. And as usual, cost changes could impact the promotion environment. Raw material markets that can be influenced by oil, including resin, have started to move down some recently, although much less than the decline in oil, and where oil goes from here is certainly unclear.

KMB,2019,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Moving on to profitability. Full-year adjusted gross margin was 35%, up 180 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 5%. We generated $425 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs. That was right in line with our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October. For 2020, we're targeting to deliver between $425 million to $500 million in total cost savings, and that includes $325 million to $375 million from FORCE.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Commodities were a drag of $145 million in 2019, although they turn favorable in the back half of the year. Foreign currencies were also a headwind, reducing operating profit at a high-single-digit rate. For 2020, we expect commodities will be somewhat favorable, mostly offset by currency headwinds, particularly in Latin America. Other manufacturing costs were also higher in 2019.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Moving further down the P&L. Between-the-lines spending was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales. That included higher advertising spending, which was up 60 basis points. SG&A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation, along with capability-building investments. Adjusted operating margin was 17.8%, up 80 basis points, and adjusted operating profit grew 5%. Operating margins were up nicely in all three business segments, led by consumer tissue and secondarily KC Professional.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"The adjusted effective tax rate was in line with plan and a drag year-on-year, partially offset by higher equity income and a lower share count. In total, full-year adjusted earnings per share were $6.89, up 4%. Our October guidance was for earnings of $6.75 to $6.90. And our original outlook last January was for earnings of $6.50 to $6.70.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Now, let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was $2.7 billion, down year-on-year as expected and driven by higher working capital. We expect a solid increase in cash flow this year, driven by higher earnings. Capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2019, in line with plan and up year-on-year, due to supply chain restructuring projects. Spending will remain elevated in 2020 because of our restructuring. We improved adjusted return on invested capital by 70 basis points to 27.2%, which is an all-time high. On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.2 billion. That's the ninth consecutive year we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. We expect to return a similar level of cash to shareholders in 2020. And our Board has already approved our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program. Overall, we've made significant progress as we close out the second year of this program. The implementation of our redesigned overhead organization has gone very well, and we've already realized most of the total program SG&A savings. In terms of supply chain, activities continue to ramp up. We've announced seven of the approximately 10 facilities that we expect to close or sell, and we've taken action on six of those. In 2020, we will start up approximately 20 new assets globally, which is roughly twice the level of activity that we would have in a typical year.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Looking at the key metrics. We're about 70% to 75% of the ways through pre-tax charges and workforce reductions. Cash payments are about 65% complete. And on savings, we accelerated savings in both 2018 and 2019. And so far, we've generated $300 million of savings compared to our total program target of $500 million to $550 million by the end of 2021. So overall, it was a very good year, and I'm pleased that we deliver top and bottom line growth ahead of our plan, while we invested more in the business for the long term.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying, I'm encouraged by our results and the progress we made in the first year of executing K-C Strategy 2022. On the top line, organic sales were up 4% in '19, ahead of our original plan for 2% growth. Our team has maintained strong focus on price realization and executed their plans well throughout the year. As a result, pricing was up 4%. And that's the highest realization we've achieved in a decade and it was necessary because of the multi-year inflation that we faced.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Pricing, Inflation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Our strategy is to elevate our categories and drive trade-up also helped us improve product mix by 1 point. While volumes were down 1%. That was better than our original expectation because of strong end-market execution, higher brand investment and less impact from price increases. Beyond sales, we delivered broad-based margin improvements and above plan earnings. We continue to leverage our financial and capital discipline as we achieved significant cost savings, improved ROIC and returned significant cash to shareholders.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Pricing, Inflation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We also invested more in our brands and businesses in 2019. As Maria noted, we increased advertising spending by 60 basis points. Digital advertising is now about two-thirds of our working media mix, and it's helping us target consumers more effectively and deploy our campaigns more quickly. We're leveraging our digital expertise and more businesses around the world, and our marketing ROI is improving. Importantly, our digital strategy is helping us grow volumes and businesses like in fem care internationally, diapers in Eastern Europe, and adult care in North America.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Pricing, Inflation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now, beyond advertising, we've also started to invest behind and focus more on improving our other commercial capabilities, including revenue management. We're taking a disciplined program management approach to this effort. This includes making sure we have the right tools, processes and resources, so we can better leverage these growth capabilities. While it's still early days, we're making good progress and I expect more going forward. All-in-all, our teams have made excellent progress in 2019. And I'm proud of their accomplishments.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Pricing, Inflation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now, I'll turn to our outlook for 2020. Our plan is consistent with our balanced approach to value creation, includes higher growth investments and aligns with our K-C Strategy 2022 financial objectives. On the top line, we're targeting organic sales growth of 2%, and that's consistent with our medium-term objective and similar to our expectation for category growth. We expect selling prices, product mix and volumes to all improve in 2020. Pricing should be weighted to the front half of the year, while volume growth will likely be more weighted to the back half. We expect the promotion environment to be competitive, but remain broadly constructive. We will continue to increase our growth investment in 2020, and that includes investment in digital marketing, in our commercial capabilities and in our products as part of our innovation agenda.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Pricing, Inflation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In the first half, we will launch innovations in North America on Huggies diapers and adult care and on Cottonelle bathroom tissue. In D&E, we have several upgrades coming in Personal Care in key markets such as China, Eastern Europe and Latin America. We're confident our growth investments and innovations will help us grow volume and improve product mix this year, and improve share performance over time. Our investments will start right away in the first quarter, while the benefits should build as the year progresses. We're targeting to grow adjusted operating profit 3% to 5% and on average, that implies 50 basis points of our operating margin expansion. Gross margin should increase more than that. On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of $7.10 to $7.35. At the midpoint, that represents growth of 5%, in line with our K-C Strategy 2022 objective. Finally, as Maria said, we expect to improve cash flow and return significant amounts of cash to shareholders.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Innovation, Growth",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,4,Michael D. Hsu,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So in summary, I'm encouraged by our progress in 2019 and our outlook for 2020.

KMB,2019,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 5% driven by higher net selling prices. We achieved strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And finally, we're broadly on track with our overall capital plan and we continue to return cash to shareholders.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Now let's cover the details of our results starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's even with a year ago and includes a five-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales were up 5% compared to flat performance in the base period. Net selling prices increased 5% and product mix improved one point, while volumes fell slightly. Mike will provide some more color in our top line in just a few minutes.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Moving on to profitabilit. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.6%, up 120 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 3% (Technical Difficulty). We now expect full year commodity inflation of $150 million to $250 million. On average that's $150 million lower than our previous estimate. The reduction is driven primarily by cost and secondarily other raw materials.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Other manufacturing costs also increased in the quarter compared to a relatively modest level last year. These costs are expected to be a bit higher than we planned for, for the full year. Moving further down the P&L, between the lines spending was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales. That included higher advertising as we're investing more behind our brands, particularly in digital. G&A expense also increased, driven by higher incentive compensation.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"For the full year, because we've raised our sales and earnings outlook, we've also increased our incentive compensation estimate. The increase versus our original plan is equal to more than 1% of total operating profit. About half of that increase was reflected in our second quarter results.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Foreign currencies were also a headwind in the quarter, reducing operating profit by a high-single digit rate. All in all, adjusted operating profit was up 2%. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.2%, up 40 basis points versus a year ago. That included broad-based margin improvements in all three business segments.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.67, up 5% year-on-year.

KMB,2019,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $609 million compared to $787 million in the year ago quarter. The decrease was generally in line with our expectations and driven by higher tax payments and increased working capital. Capital spending was $253 million in the quarter. As expected that's up versus last year, driven by supply chain restructuring projects. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. Second quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled $520 million and we continue to expect that full year amount will be between $2 billion and $2.3 billion.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,2,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Looking at our segment results, in Personal Care, organic sales were up 8%.

KMB,2019,2,Michael D. Hsu,Chief Executive Officer,"As Maria just mentioned, we delivered 5% organic sales growth in the second quarter and while that compares to a soft year ago, this was our best performance in over three years. Our pricing initiatives are on track. Our volumes are ahead of expectations both in terms of the impact from price increases and from our growth initiatives. We also continue to improve mix, which was up one point for the second consecutive quarter.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2019,2,Michael D. Hsu,Chief Executive Officer,"Let me share some of the top line highlights starting in North America. Organic sales in consumer products increased 5% compared to a 2-point decline last year. Year-to-date, organic sales were up 3%, which is likely a better reflection of our ongoing performance. Growth in the quarter was driven by 4% higher selling prices. Our pricing plans are on track. Volumes in North America were up slightly overall.

KMB,2019,2,Michael D. Hsu,Chief Executive Officer,"In China, organic sales were up double-digits compared to a soft performance last year. In diapers, our net price realization was helped by reduced and more targeted promotional spending. While Huggies total volumes were down, the product innovations we've launched are delivering growth in the premium end of our lineup and improving mix significantly. In fem care, we had another strong quarter and we're on track to achieve 20%-plus organic growth for the third consecutive year.","Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation",Kimberly-Clark

First quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.4%, even with a year ago. I'm encouraged that gross and operating margins were up 30 basis points and 40 basis points respectively compared to full-year 2018 level. Commodities were a year-on-year drag of $135 million in the quarter. While that is still a meaningful amount, I was pleased to see market prices in North America for pulp, recycled fiber, and polymer fall a bit sequentially. Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit by a low double-digit rate. Our focus on achieving higher net selling prices offset much of the commodity and currency headwinds we faced in the quarter. We also generated solid cost savings of $115 million.

We're making strong progress realizing higher selling prices; we're launching innovations, investing in our brands, and pursuing our growth priorities; and we're leveraging our strong financial discipline. As Maria just mentioned, we grew organic sales 3% in the first quarter, which is a good start to the year.

Our momentum in this region reflects the combination of excellent sales execution, winning product innovation backed by great marketing. We're launching further innovations on Huggies and Kotex this year. While diapers remain our biggest business in D&E, I'm pleased that in the first quarter we grew organic sales double-digits in fem care, adult care, and baby wipes. These businesses have strong growth opportunity and we're making progress. Now in terms of digital marketing, we're using digital on many of our brands to help us build one-to-one consumer relationships."," Feminine Care,  ASEAN,  Eastern Europe,  Digital Marketing,  D&E",Kimberly-Clark

To summarize our topline, I'm optimistic about our start to the year. We have more work to do and we continue to operate in a competitive environment. However, that said, I'm encouraged with our progress thus far. Now moving beyond sales, I'll just build briefly on Maria's comments about margins.

KMB,2018,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"We delivered 3% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and a 1% increase for the full year, consistent with our target. It was a challenging macro environment and our profitability was impacted by significant commodity inflation and currency volatility. Nonetheless, we delivered significant cost savings and achieved higher selling prices in the second half of the year and we improved capital efficiency and returned significant cash to shareholders. Now let's take a look at the details of our results."," Organic Sales Growth,  Macro Environment,  Profitability,  Cost Savings,

KMB,2018,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Starting with sales, full-year net sales were $18.5 billion of 1%, organic sales rose 1%, and that included about 2 points of positive pricing in the second half of the year. Looking at the top line by geography, in North America, organic sales in consumer products increased 1%. That was driven by an increase of more than 1% in personal care, including solid volume growth in baby care and adult care. In KC Professional in North America, organic sales increased 3%, driven by higher volumes in all major product categories."," Sales,  Net Sales,  Organic Sales,  Pricing,  Geometry",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2018,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"In developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 2%.

KMB,2018,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,Commodities were a drag of $795 million.

KMB,2018,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"We delivered full-year cost savings of $510 million, including our FORCE and restructuring program. Restructuring savings $135 million, well above our initial target of $50 million to $70 million. We made excellent progress in the first year of this program and we remain on track with our overall plan.

Target,  Soft Fourth Quarter",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2018,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Performance in the quarter included elevated transportation and distribution costs in North America, particularly in Consumer Tissue, along with some higher manufacturing-related operating costs. These factors are controllable for us and we will manage through them as we go through 2019. Moving down the P&L. Between the line spending fell 130 basis points as a percent of net sales, reflecting restructuring benefits, tight management of discretionary spending, and secondarily, lower incentive compensation."," Transportation Costs,  Distribution Costs,  Manufacturing-Related Operating Costs,  Line Spending,  Incentive Compensation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2018,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Adjusted operating margin was 17%, down 140 basis points, and adjusted operating profit fell 7%. Our adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 was 21%.

KMB,2018,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"Given the overall level of pricing we expect to achieve, we're planning for some negative volume impacts, particularly in Consumer Tissue. We have a number of innovation launches in our plan and we will support our brands with strong marketing programs. Moving beyond sales, we plan to grow adjusted operating profit by 1% to 4%.

KMB,2018,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"On average, we expect commodities and currencies in total will be a headwind on operating profit of about 20%, including a high single-digit drag from currency rate. We expect to offset much of that with higher pricing. We expect commodity inflation of $300 to 400 million. That's much less than we experienced in 2018, which we believe represented a cyclical peak in terms of year-on-year headwind."," Commodities,  Currencies,  Operating Profit,  Pricing,  Commodity

That includes for savings of $300 million to $325 million and restructuring savings of $100 million to $125 million. Our fourth target reflects lower value generated from our commodity contracts versus what we have achieved over the last couple of years. Outside of this, we expect strong performance on the other components of our FORCE program."," Total Cost Savings,  Savings,  Commodity Contracts,  FORCE Program,  Strong

KMB,2018,4,Maria Henry,Chief Financial Officer,"In addition, supply chain-related restructuring activities and savings will be ramping up in 2019. Overall, we continue to have high confidence in our ability to deliver healthy levels of supply chain savings going forward.

In terms of our earnings profile, we expect earnings will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. That's primarily because of the expected timing of the net benefit from selling price increases.

KMB,2018,4,Mike Hsu,Chief Executive Officer,"Improving the product experience, making our products more valuable and worth more to consumers is what I mean by elevating core businesses. We'll launch differentiated product innovation to drive growth in core markets.

We're using an adapt-and-deploy model for smaller markets.

Our last strategic priority is to allocate capital in value-creating ways and is very consistent with how we've operated historically.

KMB,2018,3,Michael D. Hsu,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Organic sales were up 1%, driven by 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. Margins and operating profit were impacted by significant commodity inflation and negative foreign currency effects. Hoping to partially offset those headwinds, we delivered strong cost savings and reduced overhead spending. And with the benefit of lower taxes, our adjusted earnings per share increased 7%. Finally, we continue to return cash to shareholders."," Organic Sales,  Commodity Inflation,  Foreign Currency Effects,  Cost Savings,

KMB,2018,3,Michael D. Hsu,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Now let's look at the details of the results, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down 2% year-on-year, with a 3-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales increased 1% versus a year ago.

Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.4%, down 120 basis points. Commodities were a drag of $210 million in the quarter, primarily due to pulp and other raw materials. We're now expected that full-year commodity inflation will be in the upper half of our previous estimate of $675 to $775 million."," Adjusted Gross Margin,  Adjusted Operating Margin,  Commodity Inflation,  Raw

KMB,2018,3,Michael D. Hsu,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Foreign currencies were also a sizable headwind in the quarter, reducing operating profit by high single-digit rates. On the other hand, we achieved $105 million of forced cost savings, including significant benefits from negotiated short-term raw materials contracts. We also delivered $40 million of cost savings from our restructuring program. In terms of that program, we're making good progress overall, including closing a small consumer tissue converting facility in Latin America this quarter."," Foreign Currencies,  Operating Profit,  Cost Savings,  Restructuring Program,

KMB,2018,3,Michael D. Hsu,President and Chief Operating Officer,"In addition to the restructuring, we also continued to reduce our overhead costs. In total, between-the-lines spending declined 150 basis points as a percentage of net sales. All in all, adjusted operating profit was down 8%. On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.71, up 7% year-over-year. That includes significant benefits from a lower tax rate, along with lower interest and share count. We now expect the full-year tax rate will between 21% to 22%, which is better than our estimate of 23% from three months ago, largely because of some planning initiatives.","Cost reduction, overhead costs, adjusted operating profit, earnings per share, tax rate",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2018,3,Michael D. Hsu,President and Chief Operating Officer,"I'm pleased that our effective tax rate is expected to be below target this year. Looking ahead at this point, I expect our rate in 2019 will move back up somewhere into the 23% to 26% range that we initially targeted for 2018. Therefore, we're expecting that the tax rate will be a pretty significant year-on-year earnings headwind for us in 2019.","Cost reduction, overhead costs, adjusted operating profit, earnings per share, tax rate",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2018,3,Michael D. Hsu,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Now let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $662 million, compared to $805 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease increased a $100 million U.S. pension plan contribution, restructuring payments, and the benefit of lower taxes. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $520 million in the third quarter.

In terms of the highlights for D&E personal care this quarter, in Brazil, organic sales were up high teens, including inflationary-driven price increases, and solid volume growth on diapers.

KMB,2018,3,Michael D. Hsu,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Thanks, Maria. As most of you know, the overall environment remains challenging, especially with commodity inflation and currency volatility. In the near-term, we're responding by aggressively managing our business up and down the P&L. At the same time, we continue to execute our long-term strategy to deliver sustainable growth. As we mentioned in this morning's new release, we are confirming our previous outlook for our key top and bottom line financial target. On the top line, we continue to target organic sales growth of approximately 1%.

KMB,2018,3,Michael D. Hsu,President and Chief Operating Officer,"I'm encouraged that we're making progress improving net selling prices. Pricing went from being down 1% in the first half to up 1% in the third quarter. That's consistent with what we said in July, when we indicated that pricing should be modestly positive in the back half of the year. In mid-August, we announced price increases on the majority of our consumer businesses in North America. Many of those increases will start to go into effect in the first quarter of 2019. Realizing higher selling prices will be important next year, given that recent commodity forecasts and foreign currency rates imply pretty significant headwinds again in 2019."," net selling prices,  pricing,  back half of the year,  price increases,  commodity

Hsu,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Now looking at commodities and currencies for 2018, we expect these factors will negatively impact our adjusted operating profit by slightly more than the 20% to 25% range we assumed in July. That's mostly because of the recent weakness in many foreign currencies, especially in Latin America. In addition, our commodity inflation outlook is a bit higher on average. And so as a result, our teams are further reducing costs and raising selling prices.

Organic sales were even year-on-year as growth in international markets was offset by lower sales in North America. Margins and operating profit were impacted by significant commodity inflation. Helping to offset those headwinds, we delivered strong cost savings and reduced overhead spending, and our adjusted earnings per share were up 7%. And finally, we're on track with our restructuring program. Moving on to the details of our results, starting with sales, our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's up 1% year-on-year with a one point benefit from currency rates. Organic sales were even with the year-ago. Mix improved by 1% while volumes fell less than 1% and net selling prices were down slightly.

KMB,2018,2,Maria Henry,Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,"Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 16.8%, down 100 basis points. Commodities were a drag of $200 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher pulp costs and secondarily, inflation in other raw materials. We're now expecting that full-year commodity cost inflation will be between $675 and $775 million. On average, that's $250 million more than we assumed in April and $375 million more than what we planned in our original plan in January. While commodities are higher than expected, our teams continue to do a great job delivering cost savings and tightly managing overhead and discretionary spending. We achieved $110 million of forced cost savings in the quarter, and we're now targeting $425 to $450 million of savings for the year. That's $25 to $50 million higher than our original target including more value from negotiated raw material contracts.

KMB,2018,2,Maria Henry,Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,"We're accelerating actions where feasible, and we now expect full-year savings between $100 and $120 million.

In total, between the line spending declined by 180 basis points as a percent of net sales. All in all, adjusted operating profit was down 5%. On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.59, up 7% year-on-year. That included about seven points of earnings growth from a lower tax rate along with benefits from lower interest expense and share accounts. We expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be at the low-end of our 23% to 26% target range. Let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $787 million compared to $825 million in the year-ago quarter.

Volumes decreased 3% while net selling prices increased about 2%, and product mix improved slightly. Consumer tissue operating margins of 14.1% were down 260 basis points.

KMB,2018,2,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'm gonna focus my comments on organic sales, pricing, and our full-year outlook. As Maria just mentioned, organic sales were even in the quarter. That said, organic sales were up 1% year-to-date which is right in line with our full-year target. Let me spend a few minutes on our three main growth priorities for 2018. Our first priority is to strengthen and grow our core businesses. In North American consumer products, following a strong first quarter, organic sales were down 2% in the second quarter. Halfway through the year, which is a better indicator in our performance because of some changes in our promotional shipments, volume is up 2%, and organic sales were even year-on-year. Our year-to-date market shares were up or even year-on-year in five of eight product categories. We've launched a number of innovations and are supporting our brands with strong marketing and promotion programs."," organic sales,  pricing,  full-year outlook,  growth priorities,  North American

KMB,2018,2,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Overall, these initiatives are on track with our expectations. In our K-C Professional business, second quarter organic sales were up 2% in North America with volume growth in all major product categories. K-C Professional organic sales increased 3% in developing and emerging markets, led by Asia Pacific. In developed markets outside North America, organic sales rose 1%. In South Korea, while our diaper business continues to be impacted by a lower birth rate, our other brands are growing nicely. Now let me turn to our second key priority which is to accelerate personal care growth in developing and emerging markets. Second quarter organic sales for these businesses were even year-on-year. In China, organic sales were down about 10%. Competitive promotion activity in the diaper market has increased, and we are responding appropriately. During the second quarter, we launched our upgraded Huggies premium diaper."," K-C Professional,  organic sales,  developing and emerging markets,  personal care,

KMB,2018,2,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And this quarter, we're rolling out an improved premium diaper pant. We continue to be optimistic about these innovation, although, in the near-term, we do expect marketing conditions will remain challenging. In Brazil, organic sales were up mid-single digits compared to a high-single-digit decline in the base period. Volumes were up slightly despite a modest impact from the countrywide transportation strike. Pricing has now turned positive following the increases we've implemented this year. In Argentina, organic sales were up mid-single digits. Price realization continues to be positive while volumes for us in the category are down which reflects the typical economic conditions. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased double-digits for the third consecutive quarter. Volumes rose double-digits on both Huggies and Kotex behind innovations, strong marketing programs, and continued expansion outside of Russia. In terms of our market positions, trends are positive in most of these key markets."," premium diaper pant,  innovation,  Brazil,  Argentina,  Eastern Europe",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2018,2,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Shares are up in Brazil, Argentina, and Eastern Europe, but down in China diapers. Regarding our third growth priority which is to further build digital e-commerce capabilities, we continue to make good progress. Our digital marketing programs, joint customer business plans, and investments in tools are producing good results. Online sales continue to grow at healthy double-digit rates so far this year. Now let me switch to the topic of selling prices. In April, I outlined several of our actions to improve net realized revenue. That included sheet count reductions in North American bath tissue, price increases in Latin America and other international markets, and initiatives globally in K-C Professional. These actions are broadly on track, and our pricing trends are improving. Net selling prices have gone from being down 2% in the fourth quarter last year to down 1% in the first quarter this year and down about half a point in the second quarter."," digital e-commerce capabilities,  selling prices,  net realized revenue,  sheet count

KMB,2018,2,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We expect overall pricing on the second half to turn moderately positive, mostly because of the actions we've taken in the first six months of the year. We will also be lapping elevated promotion activity in North America, especially in the fourth quarter. Still, given the headwinds we've faced, it's clear that we need more pricing. As a result, our businesses around the world, including North America are closely evaluating further opportunities to increase net selling prices. We anticipate that nearly all the impact from any potential actions would start to show up in our results next year. Now let me turn to our outlook. Clearly, the near-term environment has become more challenging, and we are responding by aggressively reducing costs and increasing selling prices. At the same time, we continue to execute our long-term strategies to deliver balanced and profitable growth. We continue to innovate, support our brands with category-building marketing campaigns, pursue targeted growth initiatives, and improve key capabilities."," pricing,  net selling prices,  cost reduction,  long-term strategies,  innovation",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2018,2,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We also continue to focus on sustainable cost reductions while we implement our global restructuring to make our company even stronger for the long haul. In terms of our specific targets for the year, on the top line, we continue to target organic sales growth of approximately 1%. On the other hand, the outlook on foreign currency has gotten considerably worse since April. We now expect currencies will have a neutral to 1% negative impact on our net sales. Three months ago, we expected a 1% to 2% positive impact. On the bottom line, we're now targeting full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $660 to $680. Our previous outlook was $690 to $720. To put that reduction in perspective, we're now expecting that commodities and currencies will be a combined year-on-year operating profit headwind of about 20% to 25%.

Market shares were up or even year-on-year in five of eight product categories and up or even sequentially compared to the prior quarter in every category. In personal care in North America, volumes increased 3%. Net selling prices were down 2%, reflecting increased investment levels that helped our volume performance."," organic sales,  full-year earnings outlook,  growth initiatives,  innovations,

KMB,2018,1,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director","In terms of innovation, in the first half we're launching product improvements on Pull-Ups training pants, Premium Huggies diapers, Huggies baby wipes, Poise pads, and Depend underwear. In consumer tissue in North America, volumes rose 9% compared to a decline of 7% in the year-ago period. Results benefited from increased promotion support, a severe cold and flu season, and promotion time and differences compared to last year. Product mix was down three points because of the promotion activity. Now in terms of product news, we're introducing new Kleenex wet wipes and bringing major bath tissue improvements to Cottonelle and part of our Scott lineup. The bath tissue upgrades are shipping now and come with sheet count reductions. This will improve net realized revenue high-single digits on nearly $1 billion in annual sales. In our K-C Professional business, volumes were up 2% in North America with growth in all product categories led by wipers."," innovation,  product improvements,  volume growth,  promotion support,  product

KMB,2018,1,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director","K-C Professional volumes increased 4% in developing and emerging markets led by Asia-Pacific. In our developed markets outside North America, organic sales rose 2%. In South Korea, our diaper business continues to be impacted by a lower birthrate. However, this was offset by strong results in our other consumer businesses there. Now let me turn to our second priority which is to accelerate personal care growth in developing and emerging markets. First quarter organic sales for these businesses were even year-on-year. Looking at some of our key markets, in Brazil, organic sales were up mid-single digits driven by broad base volume growth. Market shares were up nearly three points in diapers and two points in feminine care. Elsewhere in Latin America, organic sales were down low-single digits. That included lower volumes in Argentina, Chile, and Columbia. That said, our market positions are holding up well, including in Argentina where Huggies share is up one point."," K-C Professional,  developing and emerging markets,  organic sales,  personal care

KMB,2018,1,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director","We expect our sales to pick up in Latin America. We have a number of product innovations launching throughout the reason. And we are implementing selling price increases to help offset inflation. In China, organic sales were down mid-single digits. A strong growth in feminine care was more than offset by lower sales in diapers. We have just started to introduce a significantly upgraded Huggies premium diaper. And we have more innovation coming later in the year. We expect these innovations will improve our volume trends in the coming quarters. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased mid-teens. Our momentum continues to be strong in this part of the world with another quarter of double-digit volume growth and share gains on Huggies and Kotex. Regarding our third growth priority which is to further build digital and e-commerce capability, we continue to make good progress."," product innovations,  selling price increases,  Latin America,  China,  Eastern

KMB,2018,1,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director","Our targeted digital marketing programs, investments in tools to improve capabilities, and customer joint business plans are producing strong results. That was especially true this quarter in North America. So, to summarize our top-line, I'm encouraged with our start to the year. We know we have more work to do because we continue to operate in a competitive environment. That said, our first quarter results and our plans going forward give me further confidence in our 1% organic growth target for the year. Now let me turn to our earnings outlook. We continue to target full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 690 to 720. That's year-on-year growth of 11% to 16%. Our teams are taking actions to improve net realized revenue and reduce costs to offset the commodity headwind we're facing. We expect these actions will help improve our margins from first quarter levels, especially in the second half of the year. On the revenue front, we're taking steps in several areas of our business."," digital marketing programs,  investments,  customer joint business plans,  earnings
outlook,  commodity headwind",Kimberly-Clark
KMB,2018,1,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director","These actions include the sheet count reductions in North America and the price increases in Latin America that I just mentioned. In addition, our consumer businesses in other international markets will be raising prices, and our K-C Professional team has begun to do the same in most regions. While many of these initiatives were included in our original plan for the year, our overall expectation for selling price increases has improved slightly from three months ago. In terms of our focus on cost, FORCE savings should build from first quarter levels. In addition, as Maria noted, restructuring savings will occur mostly in the back half of the year, and our teams are moving with urgency to accelerate actions. We're also redoubling our efforts to reduce discretionary spending."," selling price increases,  cost reduction,  FORCE savings,  restructuring savings,

KMB,2018,1,Michael Hsu,"President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director","In total, we expect these actions combined with our volume growth initiatives, a slightly better currency outlook, and some flexibility that we built into our original 2018 plan will enable us to deliver our earnings guidance for the year. So, to summarize, we're off to a good start to the year on the top-line and with our market positions. We're taking steps to improve our profitability, and we are broadly on track with our 2018 plan. Overall, we remain very optimistic about our opportunities to create long-term shareholder value through successful execution of our strategies.

CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"I will cover this in more detail shortly. But ultimately, this behavior shift has elongated the volume recovery period across the industry, which is reflected in our Q1 top-line results. As we've navigated these macro dynamics, I'm proud of the team for delivering another quarter of strong margin improvement and EPS growth. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our leverage ratio during the quarter while investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders.","Earnings call,

CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"Our team's execution supported a strong supply chain recovery during the quarter, hitting pre-pandemic service levels as we exited Q1. Looking toward the remainder of the year, we will work to drive volumes and top-line growth through targeted and disciplined investments behind prudent merchandising and continued support for our strong innovation. Finally, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal '24, reflecting confidence in our plans, people, and agility as we navigate a shifting consumer environment. As I mentioned a moment ago, the timetable for volume recovery has been elongated across the industry due to near-term consumer behavior changes.","Supply chain
recovery, Volume growth, Merchandising, Innovation, Guidance",Conagra Brands
CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"After three years of unprecedented inflation, along with other macro dynamics, consumers have felt increased financial pressure and used a variety of strategies to stretch their balance sheets. This resulted in a near-term reprioritization of their typical purchase behaviors in order to make their budgets work. We've seen shifts like this before and expect these near-term changes in behavior to also be temporary. In fact, recent trends suggest this is already underway.","Inflation, Macro
dynamics, Consumer behavior, Budgeting, Temporary changes",Conagra Brands
CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"Let me provide a bit more color on the kinds of behavioral shifts we've observed. As you've seen for some time now, with the notable exception of summer travel, discretionary purchases have been down almost across the board. Consumers have also been actively reducing remnant household inventory from the pandemic. Within food, convenience-oriented items, typically a top consumer priority, have lagged as shoppers have turned to more hands-on food prep to get additional bang for their buck.","Consumer behavior,
Discretionary purchases, Household inventory, Food, Convenience items",Conagra Brands
CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"And as they've done this, not surprisingly, they have shifted from meals per one to meals per many, even if not everyone is home at the same time to eat together. And the last shift I will mention is a reduction in wasted food and an increase in the use of leftovers. Collectively, these short-term behavior shifts act as a sort of cheat code to help these consumers spend within their means. Slide 8 demonstrates the elongated volume recovery across the industry.","Consumer behavior,

CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"As you can see, through the four-week period ending August 26, the entire peer group was showing volume performance within a very tight band with Conagra in the middle of the pack. As I mentioned a minute ago, more recent trends are showing the first signs of improved performance. With that backdrop, let's dive into our results shown on Slide 9. As you can see, in the quarter, we delivered organic net sales of approximately 2.9 billion, which is down slightly compared to last year as a result of the slower volume recovery we discussed.","Volume performance,

CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"Adjusted gross margin of 27.6% was up 272 basis points from last year.

Diving further into our top-line performance by retail domain, you can see on Slide 10 that sales in our staples domain were flat compared to the prior year.","Gross margin,

CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"As consumers shift toward more stretchable meals, our staples categories, such as canned chili and canned tomato, are well positioned and have gained unit share compared to last year. Despite the macro headwinds, our snacks domain has continued to grow as shown on Slide 11. We're building unit share as consumers continue to respond positively to our microwave popcorn and ready-to-eat pudding and gel brands. Looking at Slide 12, you can see that our frozen domain has been the most significantly impacted by recent shifts in consumer behavior, particularly in areas like single-serve meals, given the headwinds we discussed a moment ago.","Staples categories,

CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"As we look at the frozen domain, it's worth noting a few key points. First, despite the recent impact on volume, we continue to gain unit share in important frozen categories like single-serve meals. This dynamic demonstrates the relative strength and strong position of our brands. Second, the year-over-year performance figures do not properly represent the broader trend within frozen food.","Frozen domain, Unit

CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"In fact, if you look over a four-year period, Conagra's frozen retail sales have increased 22%. Frozen meals has been one of the fastest-growing categories in in-home consumption over the past 40 years. Its 4% CAGR is in the top tier of foods growing in at-home consumption. This expansion has been fueled by the long-term sustained consumer demand for convenience, as well as the addition of innovation and quality ingredients.","Frozen retail sales,

CAG,2024,1,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"This 40-year trend demonstrates the critical role that frozen plays in providing convenient, high-quality foods for every occasion which consumers have come to increasingly rely on. This is central to why we believe the current softness is temporary. Turning to Slide 14, I'm pleased to share that we continue to advance our supply chain initiatives during the quarter, allowing us to return our service performance back to pre-pandemic levels.

We'll also continue to prioritize reducing our debt and improving our net leverage ratio. We are reaffirming our fiscal '24 guidance that we shared last quarter, including organic net sales growth of approximately 1% compared to fiscal '23, adjusted operating margin of 16% to 16.5%, and adjusted EPS between $2.70 to $2.75.

CAG,2024,1,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Slide 18 highlights our results from the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our profit and cash flow delivery and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance targets. In Q1, net sales were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 0.3% decrease in organic net sales, driven primarily from the elongated recovery of volumes due to the industrywide slowdown in consumption that Sean discussed earlier.","Profit, Cash flow, Guidance, Volume,

CAG,2024,1,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Gross margin recovery was a key priority for us in fiscal '23, and we delivered another strong result in Q1. Adjusted gross profit increased by 10.9% in the quarter, primarily from the pricing implemented in the prior year and strong productivity, which more than offset the negative impacts of cost of goods sold inflation and unfavorable operating leverage. Adjusted gross margin increased 272 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA increased 12.1%, largely driven by the increase in adjusted gross profit.

CAG,2024,1,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"The 0.3% decrease in organic net sales was driven by a 6.6% decrease in volume which was partially offset by a 6.3% improvement in price mix, a result of fiscal '23's inflation-driven pricing actions. A small benefit from the impact of foreign exchange contributed to reported net sales coming in flat for the quarter. Slide 20 shows the top-line performance for each segment in Q1.

CAG,2024,1,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We gained dollar share in snacking categories, including seeds and microwave popcorn, as well as in staples categories, including chili and canned meat. As Sean discussed earlier, our refrigerated and frozen segment was the most impacted by recent consumer behavior shifts, with net sales down 4.6% in the quarter. Our international and foodservice segments combined are slightly below 20% of our net sales.

CAG,2024,1,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Our international segment delivered year-over-year volume growth in addition to improved price mix, which helped support strong organic net sales growth of 8.2% during the quarter. Our two largest international regions, Mexico and Canada, delivered double-digit organic net sales growth over prior year. We also saw low single-digit volume growth in Mexico, which contributed to the segment's overall positive volumes. For the remainder of the year, we expect volume growth to continue in international.","Volume growth, Price mix,

CAG,2024,1,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Our foodservice segment delivered 5.2% net sales growth in Q1 from strong price mix, and we expect to see positive net sales growth in foodservice for the fiscal year. Foodservice also delivered a strong gross margin in Q1 versus a year ago due to the reduction of supply chain disruption costs incurred in the prior year. This benefit is not expected to extend beyond Q1. Our foodservice segment supplies a diverse set of clients beyond restaurants, including healthcare, travel and leisure, and educational institutions, and we are well positioned to compete in these markets.","Foodservice segment growth, Price

CAG,2024,1,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 21 highlights our adjusted operating margin bridge. We are pleased to have delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of strong gross margin improvement, up 272 basis points in Q1. We drove a 4 percentage point improvement from price mix during the quarter. We also realized a 1.8 percentage point benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives, along with the wrap of some supply chain disruptions in the prior year.","Gross margin improvement, Price mix,

CAG,2024,1,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"These price and productivity benefits were slightly offset by cost of goods sold inflation, a margin headwind of 3.1%. Those factors, combined with small year-over-year favorability in A&P and SG&A, drove the 297 basis point improvement in operating margin for the quarter. Slide 22 details our margin performance by segment for Q1.

CAG,2024,1,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"It is worth noting that our refrigerated and frozen segment continued its very strong operating profit and margin recovery in the quarter with adjusted operating margin improving 294 basis points versus a year ago. Our Q1 adjusted EPS increased to $0.66, representing a 15.8% increase over the prior year. Higher adjusted gross profit and slightly lower A&P and adjusted SG&A were the positive contributors to our adjusted EPS performance in the quarter.

CAG,2024,1,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 24 includes our key balance sheet and cash flow metrics. At the end of the quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.55 times, down from the end of fiscal '23. We will continue to prioritize reducing our debt and lowering our net leverage ratio in fiscal '24.

This strong free cash flow enabled us to pay down approximately 130 million of net short-term debt while also funding 157 million for the Q1 dividend, highlighting our focus on balanced capital allocation. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to prioritize paying down debt. As mentioned, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal '24, given the strong Q1 profit and margin performance and the confidence in our investment plans year to go as we continue to navigate a shifting consumer environment.","Capex investment, Free cash flow,

Let's take a closer look at how we expect to achieve that guidance during Q2 and the back half of fiscal '24 shown on Slide 26. During Q2, we expect to continue seeing low single digit organic net sales decline, but volume decline should improve versus Q1 as we wrap inflation-driven pricing actions from fiscal '23. As Sean mentioned, we will redeploy some of our strong gross profit into strategic investments behind quality, high ROI merchandising and increased A&P to support our brands.","Organic net sales growth, Adjusted

These efforts to execute against our fiscal '23 strategic priorities and the continued implementation of our playbook have our brands well positioned, following the volatility of the past few years.

Organic net sales for the quarter grew over 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 and adjusted gross margin of 27%, representing a 216 basis-point increase over the fourth quarter last year. The full year results underscore the strength of our performance across all four metrics, including 6.6% organic net sales growth and 17.4% adjusted EPS growth compared to the prior-year period, as well as robust gross and operating margin improvement.

CAG,2023,4,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"We continued our disciplined pricing execution in the face of ongoing inflation, which helped to drive margin recovery, a top priority coming into fiscal '23. Our supply chain continued to improve as we made meaningful progress on our cost savings initiatives, which, in turn, led to a vast improvement in service levels. We remain committed to lowering our net leverage ratio, which was reduced from 4.0 to 3.6 times by the end of the fiscal year. And we did all of this while investing to maintain the brand strength that we've built up for many years running.","Pricing execution, Supply chain
improvement, Cost savings initiatives, Net leverage ratio reduction, Brand strength investment",Conagra Brands
CAG,2023,4,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"Let's take a closer look at these priorities starting with the impact of our inflation-justified pricing actions on Slide 9. As you can see, pricing peaked in Q3 but remains almost 17% above the prior year due to our actions to offset ongoing COGS inflation. During the fourth quarter, elasticities did soften a bit but remain fairly consistent, well below historical norms and in line or better than competitors. Our strong execution was instrumental in driving margin recovery, which is detailed on Slide 10.","Pricing actions, Margin recovery,
Elasticities, Competition, Slide 9 and 10",Conagra Brands
CAG,2023,4,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"As we've previously discussed, there is an inherent lag between the time when inflation hits and when we're able to recover that cost through inflation-justified pricing. This lag effect results in temporarily compressed margins as we saw most notably throughout fiscal '22. We took great strides to recover our gross margin in fiscal '23, and Q4 was our third consecutive quarter of strong margin improvement, up 216 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Turning to Slide 11, we continue to advance our supply chain initiatives, investing to rebuild our own inventory, which helped us to deliver service levels of 95% as we exited the fiscal year.","Gross margin improvement, Supply chain

CAG,2023,4,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"While we're making strong progress in supply chain, it's not yet back to normal as we experienced transitory disruptions in the quarter, such as the cybersecurity event at Americold. That said, we're pleased with our progress so far and see more room for improvement in fiscal '24, including investing in technology and modernization as the operating environment continues to normalize. Slide 12 highlights one of the key ways in which we are investing to maintain brand strength, our persistent focus on modernizing brands through innovation.

CAG,2023,4,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"As you can see in the weekly scanner data, food companies are starting to wrap pricing in the year-ago period and dollar sales are coming down as expected, but the rate of improvement in volume recovery is lagging. That suggests new consumer behavior shifts beyond the initial elasticity effects that occurred when pricing actions were initially taken. We have seen this dynamic since just after Easter, and it has been broad-based across many categories and competitors. And importantly, where we see it, it is usually not a trade-down to lower-priced alternatives within the category.","Food companies pricing, Dollar sales,
Volume recovery, Consumer behavior shift, Slide 19",Conagra Brands
CAG,2023,4,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"Rather, it's an overall category slowdown. The question is, why now, given the steadiness we have seen from the consumer for two years? There are several possibilities at the root of this. One behavior shift we have heard about from consumers is just buying fewer items overall, more of a hunkering down than a trading down.

CAG,2023,4,Sean Connolly,Chief Executive Officer,"Overall, we view this dynamic as likely temporary behavior shift for consumers to stretch their budgets, but we have captured it as a near-term headwind in our outlook. Moving to the second headwind, while very limited, we have seen a few single ingredient brands become deflationary, and we will make appropriate price adjustments to reflect that. Finally, the reduction of pension income and decline in contribution from Ardent Mills compared to its strong fiscal '23 performance will impact our earnings performance compared to the prior year.

CAG,2023,4,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. As Sean noted, we have made great progress from this time one year ago, as shown on this page. We navigated a challenging operating environment and successfully delivered on our priorities to implement inflation-justified pricing, drive gross margin recovery, reduce net leverage, and rebuild inventory levels, all while investing to maintain the strength of our brands. This enabled us to deliver strong full year results that exceeded our original fiscal '23 expectations on all metrics.","Progress, Priorities, Gross margin

CAG,2023,4,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 24 highlights our results from the quarter and full fiscal year. During fiscal '23, we delivered strong top-line growth with full year organic net sales up 6.6% compared to fiscal '22, driven by our inflation-justified pricing and modest elasticities. Margin recovery was a top priority for fiscal '23, and our business delivered, increasing adjusted gross margin by 226 basis points and adjusted operating margin by 125 basis points for the full year. This margin enhancement contributed to strong full year adjusted EPS growth of 17.4%.","Strong top-line growth, Organic net

CAG,2023,4,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 25 shows our net sales bridge for the quarter and full year. The increases in fourth quarter and full year organic net sales were driven by improvements in price mix, primarily from inflation-justified pricing actions, and were partially offset by a decrease in volumes. We estimate that our fourth quarter volume was impacted by the transitory supply chain disruptions from the cybersecurity incident at Americold, impacting revenue by approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. This disruption negatively impacted sales in our refrigerated and frozen segment during the fourth quarter, an impact of approximately 110 basis points for the quarter.","Organic net sales growth, Price mix,

CAG,2023,4,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We drove a 7.1% margin gain from improved price mix during the quarter and realized a 40 basis-point net benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives. These pricing and productivity benefits were partially offset by continued inflationary pressure with market inflation and market-based sourcing negatively impacting our margins by 2.1% and 3.3% respectively. Adjusted operating margin was 14.6% for the fourth quarter, which was a 39 basis-point decline versus a year ago. The strong gross margin improvement was more than offset by increased A&P investment and an increase in SG&A from both higher incentive compensation expense and transitory asset write-offs in the quarter.","Margin

Grocery and snacks operating margins were down 248 basis points due primarily to increased inventory reserves for excess seasonal inventory, along with unfavorable manufacturing overhead absorption. The international segment increased adjusted operating margin 497 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by pricing, while the foodservice segment adjusted operating margins were down 75 basis points due to some transitory asset write-offs.

CAG,2023,4,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Let's take a closer look at the drivers of our adjusted EPS guidance on Slide 32. Compared to the prior-year period, we anticipate continued improvement to our adjusted gross profit to be offset by the impact of elevated investments in A&P and SG&A to support our innovation and our people, higher interest expense from interest rate increases approximating $450 million, and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 24%. That nets to adjusted EPS growth of 2% to 4% in our underlying business operations, or an adjusted EPS of $2.83 to $2.88. We also expect the growth in our underlying business operations to be offset by lower income from our Ardent Mills joint venture, as well as the reduction of pension income due to higher interest rates.","Adjusted EPS

CAG,2023,4,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"As we previously discussed, Ardent Mills had a particularly strong fiscal '23 driven by favorable market conditions and the venture's effective management through recent volatility in the wheat markets. As we transition toward a more normalized operating environment, we expect lower Ardent Mills income of approximately $150 million in fiscal '24, which is still a very strong operating performance relative to historical results as Ardent continues to mature as a business. I will now unpack a few additional assumptions behind our guidance shown here on Slide 33.

From a supply chain perspective, we expect capex spend of approximately $500 million as we continue to make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation. We also expect the investments we are making to drive gross productivity savings of approximately 300 million during fiscal '24.

At the total ConAgra level, we grew retail sales more than 10% on a one-year basis and more than 26% on a three-year basis. We're pleased with our solid share performance, including how our strong brands allowed us to largely maintain total company market share while taking several inflation-justified pricing actions, particularly during the past year.

It's clear that consumers continue to appreciate the quality, convenience, and superior relative value that our strong brands have to offer, which has enabled ConAgra to perform extremely well on both an absolute and relative basis.

We also accelerated growth in our highly relevant staples portfolio, increasing retail sales 10% this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year, and 22% compared to the same period three years ago. This growth was led by pickles and whipped toppings, which grew more than 11% and 10%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.

CAG,2023,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 12 details the relationship between pricing and volume over time. As you would expect, increased pricing does have an impact on volume, both for ConAgra and the total industry. However, you can see how elasticities have remained steady even as we have continued to increase the price per unit of our products to help offset ongoing cost inflation. And as we detailed a few minutes ago, ConAgra's three-year CAGR on unit sales performance leads its near-in peer group.","Pricing and

CAG,2023,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The relatively modest elasticities, both compared to historic norms and our peers, are a testament to the strength of our brand. Now that we've unpacked the relationship between price and volume and the resulting net sales, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the relationship between net sales and COGS and the resulting impact on our margin performance on Slide 13. Generally speaking, when a business has strong brands, strong processes, and strong people, as ConAgra does, it is able to navigate inflationary cycles in discrete, predictable phases. As we have detailed for some time, when unprecedented inflation increased our cost of goods, we took strategic pricing actions to help offset the rising costs.","Strong brands,

CAG,2023,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"However, there was an inherent lag between when we implemented pricing actions and when we realized the benefits of those actions in our top-line results. This pricing lag resulted in temporary margin compression. Furthermore, continued inflation extended this period of margin compression as new inflation-justified pricing actions led to additional lag effects. That is the dynamic we have experienced over the last several quarters as we continued to play catch-up by increasing price incrementally to account for the extraordinary extended rise in inflation.","Pricing lag,
Margin compression, Inflation-justified pricing, Top-line results, Catch-up",Conagra Brands
CAG,2023,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"End of the first quarter, we reached a significant inflection point in the relationship between net sales and COGS, marking the end of the temporary margin compression phase and the beginning of the margin recovery phase. As you can see in the chart, inflation has begun to moderate in certain areas, enabling our inflation-justified pricing actions to catch up to the rising costs. Slide 14 shows the impact this inflection has had on our gross margin results. As continuously rising inflation weighed on our COGS throughout fiscal '22 and into the first quarter of fiscal '23, our margins were compressed.","Net sales and
COGS, Margin compression, Inflation moderation, Gross margin results, Pricing actions",Conagra Brands
CAG,2023,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Now, predictably, as pricing has finally caught up to COGS inflation, you can see the recovery of our gross margin to be more in-line with pre-pandemic levels. While our gross margin can vary quarter to quarter due to a range of internal and external factors, the strategic pricing actions we have successfully executed, combined with moderating inflation and our strong brands, position us well to recover and maintain a healthy gross margin going forward. Of course, inflation remains elevated in many areas, and we continue to closely monitor our cost just as we have in the past. We will continue to take appropriate inflation,-justified pricing actions as needed.","Gross margin

CAG,2023,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Another key driver of our margin recovery is our supply chain performance shown on Slide 15. This is due to a combination of macro factors, as well as the strategic initiatives we are executing to improve our operations. We made good progress on our supply chain during the second quarter, which benefited from improvements in the service we provided to our customers, continued headway on our ongoing productivity initiatives which remain on track to achieve the targets we outlined at our most recent Investor Day, more moderate increases in commodity prices, and improved inventory levels due to an increase in the availability of materials.

CAG,2023,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Before I turn the mic over, I want to summarize what I've covered today. Our strong performance during the first half of fiscal '23 was primarily driven by a combination of inflation-justified pricing actions and muted elasticities, reflecting the strength of our brands.

CAG,2023,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Adjusted gross margin increased to 28.2%, and adjusted gross profit dollars growth was up 21.7%, benefiting from higher organic net sales and productivity initiatives. The increase in adjusted gross profit, combined with another strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, contributed to adjusted EBITDA growth of 21.5%. Slide 20 provides a breakdown of our net sales. As you can see, the 8.6% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 17% improvement in price mix, which was a result of inflation-justified pricing actions that were reflected in the marketplace throughout the quarter.","Adjusted gross

CAG,2023,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"This was partially offset by an 8.4% decrease in volume, primarily due to the elasticity impact of those pricing actions.

CAG,2023,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We also realized a 1.3% benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives. These pricing and productivity benefits were partially offset by continued inflationary pressure, with 11% gross market inflation negatively impacting our operating margins by 7.5% and a negative margin impact of 2.9% from market-based sourcing. As a reminder, as commodity prices rose quickly last year, we benefited from locking in contracted costs that were lower than the market. Even though we see commodity inflation moderating, we will not immediately realize a benefit to the P&L as our costs may remain higher than the spot market due to the timing of our contracts and when they roll off.","Supply chain

As Sean detailed, our decisive inflation-justified pricing actions, coupled with improved service levels and productivity, allowed us to successfully navigate ongoing inflationary pressures and industrywide supply chain challenges and deliver adjusted operating margin expansion in each segment during the quarter. We were also pleased that higher sales and productivity once again offset headwinds from inflation and elevated supply chain operating costs across all four segments in Q2. As a result of this continued strong performance, total adjusted operating profit increased 25.9% to 563 million during the quarter, despite an increase in adjusted corporate expense during the period primarily due to increased incentive compensation.","Inflation-

This significant increase was primarily driven by higher sales and gross profit, as well as a small benefit from a continued strong performance from Ardent Mills. Slightly offsetting these positives were higher A&P and adjusted SG&A compared to the prior-year period, as well as lower pension and post-retirement income, higher interest expense, and the impact of adjusted taxes.","Adjusted EPS,

As we entered the second half of the fiscal year, we will continue to evaluate the highest and best use of capital to strengthen our balance sheet and optimize shareholder value. As Sean mentioned, we are raising our fiscal '23 guidance for net sales growth, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, given our strong performance in the first half of fiscal '23 and expectations for a solid performance for the balance of the year.

CAG,2023,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We expect gross inflation to continue but moderate through the remainder of the fiscal year, resulting in an inflation rate of approximately 10% for fiscal '23. Additional inflation-justified pricing actions that have previously been communicated and accepted will go into market in Q3. However, the magnitude of these pricing actions will be smaller and more targeted than previous pricing actions. As always, we will continue to monitor inflation levels and price, as needed, to manage future volatility.","Inflation

CAG,2023,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We anticipate capex spend of approximately 425 million in fiscal '23 as we make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation. Approximately 200 million of the 425 million was spent in the first half of fiscal '23. Lastly, we expect interest expense to approximate 405 million, and pension and post-retirement income to approximate 25 million for the year, driven by the higher interest rate environment.

CAG,2023,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"To sum things up, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first half of fiscal '23, especially the recovery of Q2 adjusted gross margins to near pre-COVID levels. This, along with our expected continued positive business momentum, led to raising our full fiscal year '23 guidance. Our strong performance amid such a dynamic environment would not be possible without the hard work of our entire team and reflects the ongoing strength of our brands and successful execution of the ConAgra Way playbook.

Takeaways, Working with Melissa, Fiscal '22 earnings call, Q4",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Throughout fiscal '22, our team took decisive actions to offset inflation and invest in our business. We faced heightened costs throughout the year but inflationary pressures were especially high in the fourth quarter. As a result, we implemented additional inflation-justified pricing actions to help offset the impact. We continued to make deliberate strategic investments in our business to better serve our customers and meet the strong consumer demand for our products as physical availability is an important part of maintaining and building trust and loyalty.","Inflation,

CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I'm pleased that our brands continue to resonate with consumers, demonstrated by broad-based share gains within the portfolio, particularly within our most strategic domains of Frozen and Snacks. We are continuing to drive growth, gain share in attractive categories, and we remain disciplined in executing the ConAgra Way to create lasting connections with consumers. As we've communicated throughout the year, the external factors I touched on a moment ago, as well as investments we made to maximize service and product availability in the face of supply constraints, all contributed to increased margin pressure. We continued to pull levers to manage these factors, and we were pleased to see margin improvement materialize in the fourth quarter in Grocery and Snacks, as well as Foodservice.","Growth,

CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"This represents an important inflection point that we expect will extend to our Refrigerated and Frozen and our International businesses within fiscal '23. I also want to highlight the strong fourth quarter performance of our joint venture, Ardent Mills, which effectively managed through recent volatility in the wheat markets and continued to prove an effective hedge against inflation. Looking ahead to fiscal '23, we expect to see continued strength in our sales, driven by strong innovation, the impact of pricing actions, and progress in the supply chain to help offset continued inflation and elasticities. While we expect elasticities to increase incrementally from fiscal '22 levels as more inflation-justified pricing comes to market, we believe they will remain below historical levels.","Growth,

CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"These expectations are reflected in the fiscal '23 guidance we're providing today. With this expected macroeconomic backdrop, we are lowering our long-term leverage target which Dave will discuss later. As you know, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet and keeping our investment-grade credit rating remain important to us. With that overview, let's take a look at the results.","Guidance,
Macroeconomic Backdrop, Balance Sheet, Credit Rating, Results",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"While we had planned for high inflation, it was higher than we anticipated. Slide 7 shows our cost of goods increased 16% in fiscal '22, far higher than the 9% we anticipated at the time of our fiscal '21 fourth quarter call a year ago. Inflation was particularly acute during the fiscal '22 fourth quarter when our cost of goods sold were 17% higher than the year-ago period and 24% higher on a two-year basis. The elevated levels of inflation we experienced in fiscal '22, particularly in the fourth quarter, required decisive actions in response.","Inflation, Cost of Goods Sold, Supply Chain, Decisive Actions, Response",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"A critical part of that response included the inflation-justified pricing we implemented throughout fiscal '22. On Slide 8, you can see the change in on-shelf pricing by quarter. On-self prices for our brands rose across all three domestic retail domains compared to the same period a year ago and also increased in Q4 as we experienced additional inflationary pressures. We closely monitor the impact of these pricing actions on volumes.","Inflation-Justified Pricing, On-Shelf Pricing, Domestic Retail Domains, Volume Impact, Monitoring",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We've been pleased that price elasticity has remained below historical levels. Slide 9 demonstrates that unit sales have stayed largely consistent on a three-year basis, even as the on-shelf prices for our brands have increased. Even in Q4, as more significant inflation-justified pricing took effect, the increase in elasticity was relatively modest and below historical norm. As we monitor the impact of our pricing actions on volume, we looked at the relative impact between branded foods and private label.","Pricing

CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"While private label is gaining some share more broadly in food, we have not seen notable migration toward private label in the heavily branded categories in which we compete. The superior relative value of our products continues to resonate with our customers and our consumers, and the resiliency of our portfolio means we are well-positioned to take additional action in fiscal '23 if we continue to experience incremental inflation. As a result of our decisive actions, we're beginning to see the expected recovery in our margin performance. As I mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter represented an important inflection point as we saw margin improvements materialize in Grocery and Snacks and Foodservice which helped drive fourth-quarter operating margin improvement for the total company.","Resilience, Share Gain, Inflation, Margin Improvement, Recovery",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As I already noted, we expect our Refrigerated and Frozen and International segments to deliver operating margin improvement as fiscal '23 progresses. As you can see on Slide 11, our team delivered solid Q4 results in the face of a highly dynamic and challenging operating environment. Compared to the fourth quarter of '21, organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased at just under 7%, with growth in all four segments. And importantly, adjusted operating margin increased approximately 100 basis points, and adjusted EPS was up over 20%.","Refrigerated and Frozen Segment, International Segment, Operating Margin Improvement, Adjusted EPS,

CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I'd like to briefly detail our performance across our three retail domains, starting with our Frozen business on Slide 12. Frozen continues to be one of the strongest businesses in our portfolio and offers modern attributes, convenience, and quality to make it the perfect fit for today's consumer. In Q4, we continued to deliver strong growth on both a one-year and three-year basis. And within this consumer domain, we've seen growth across key categories, highlighted by more than double-digit year-over-year growth in both plant-based protein and single-serve meals.","Frozen

CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Now let's talk about Snacks. As shown on Slide 13, we've seen a meaningful acceleration in retail sales growth in our Snacks business over the last three years. In the fourth quarter, our Snacks business grew 11% year over year. That equates to 34% growth over the same period in 2019.","Retail

CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In this domain, we've driven growth in key categories, including meat snacks, hot cocoa, microwave popcorn, and salty snacks. Our retail sales of ingredients and enhancers, and shelf-stable meals and sides have also been growing meaningfully over a three-year period, and that trend continued in the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 14, this business grew 5% year over year and 10% on a three-year basis. In particular, we saw a large increase in the retail sales for syrup, which was up nearly 20% in Q4 on a two-year basis.","Key

CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we execute our ConAgra Way playbook, innovation has remained a key to our success across the portfolio. Slide 15 shows the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and a modernized portfolio. During the fourth quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year-ago period, and once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including with toppings, single-serve meals, and plant-based protein. Looking at Slide 16, you can see that we continue to grow sales on both a one- and three-year basis.","Innovation, Portfolio Modernization, Key Categories, Fourth Quarter Growth, Sales Growth",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Total ConAgra retail sales were up 15.8% on a three-year basis for the year. We also continued to gain share in the important Frozen and Snacks categories with our category-weighted share growth up both on a one-year and three-year basis. With that context for fiscal '22, let's turn to our outlook for fiscal '23.

CAG,2022,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Continued inflationary pressure in fiscal '23 is expected to result in incremental increases in elasticity, which, overall, we anticipate will continue to remain below historical levels. Our outlook also reflects our expectation that we will have higher capex and interest expense in fiscal '23, lower pension income, and that the elevated performance from Ardent Mills in fiscal '22 will moderate. We look forward to sharing more details about our expectations for the year at our upcoming Investor Day.

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter and full year, which are shown on Slide 22. Overall, we feel very good about how we are exiting fiscal '22 and the way we navigated the dynamic operating environment that impacted our entire industry throughout the year. During fiscal '22, we delivered strong top-line growth with full-year organic net sales up 3.8% compared to fiscal '21, reflecting the continued relevancy of our portfolio to consumers.","Strong

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"While higher-than-expected cost of goods sold inflation weighed on our adjusted operating margins throughout the year, we were encouraged to see Q4 operating margins improve versus year-ago. Overall, our full fiscal year '22 adjusted operating margins decreased by 312 basis points versus last year to 14.4%, which was in line with the revised expectations we provided during our third quarter call. Fiscal '22 adjusted EPS of $2.36 was also in line with our revised expectations. Turning to Slide 23, you can see our net sales bridge for the quarter and full year.","Cost of

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"During the fourth quarter, the 6.8% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 13.2% improvement in price mix as a result of continued inflation-justified pricing actions as well as favorable brand mix. This was partially offset by a 6.4% decrease in volume. The headwinds from the divestiture of our Egg Beaters business and the impact of foreign exchange were the final contributors toward the 6.2% increase in total ConAgra Brands net sales during the fourth quarter.

This point is reinforced on Slide 24, which shows the top-line performance of each of our segments. As Sean mentioned, we are pleased that net sales continued to grow across the portfolio for both the quarter and full year when compared to the respective year-ago periods.

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"The sales momentum of the business is strong as we exit fiscal '22. We detailed our adjusted operating margin bridge on Slide 25. In aggregate, our adjusted operating margin was 15% for the fourth quarter, approximately 100 basis points above the year-ago period.

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Although our productivity in the quarter was below historic levels given continued supply chain challenges, the rate was up compared to Q3, and we are seeing steady improvement in our supply chain operations as we exit fiscal year '22. The price and productivity benefits were more than offset by gross market inflation of 17.3%, which impacted our operating margins by more than 12%. I will unpack the inflation impacts in more detail shortly. Together, these factors contributed to the 147-basis-point decrease in our adjusted gross margin for the quarter compared to the year-ago period.","Supply

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Advertising and promotion costs for the quarter decreased 38.7%, driven primarily by lapping the significant increases in A&P during Q4 last year. This decrease contributed 1.1% to overall adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A costs also declined during the quarter, driven by decreased incentives and deferred compensation, contributing an additional 1.3% benefit. Slide 26 breaks down our adjusted operating margins by segment.","Advertising and Promotion Costs, Adjusted Operating Margin, Segment Performance, SG&A Costs,

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We were encouraged to see both our adjusted gross margins and adjusted operating margins in our Grocery and Snacks and Foodservice segments hit inflection points during the fourth quarter and begin to improve compared to last year. The recovery in these segments drove the 13.5% year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating profit during the fourth quarter. Our Refrigerated and Frozen segment was most impacted by higher-than-anticipated input cost inflation in Q4, particularly in proteins and edible oils. The above-forecast inflation in Refrigerated and Frozen has pushed forward the lag until additional inflation-justified pricing is reflected in market.","Adjusted

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"As we have mentioned previously, we believe our Refrigerated and Frozen segment, and our Frozen portfolio in particular, is well positioned for further success. Our International segment was also impacted by higher-than-anticipated inflation and some FX headwinds versus prior year. Pricing actions were implemented as planned but were not enough to fully offset the cost headwinds incurred. As Sean mentioned earlier, we expect to see operating margins expand in both our Refrigerated and Frozen and International segments in fiscal '23 as pricing actions catch up to the recent inflation.","Refrigerated and Frozen Segment, Frozen Portfolio, International Segment, Pricing Actions, Fiscal
'23 Performance",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"I would like to take a deeper dive into the gross market inflation we experienced during the quarter, shown here on Slide 27. Inflation continued to rise to over 17%, above the high end of the range that we were anticipating at the time of our third-quarter call. It rose most acutely for commodities that are particularly difficult to hedge, including chicken and pork. Even though we forecasted a significant acceleration of our chicken and pork costs in Q4, as depicted in the charts on the right, actual inflation came in even higher, especially in chicken, which hit record levels compared to our expectations as of the Q3 call.","Gross

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We continue to pull on a number of levers to offset the elevated costs, including an additional round of inflation-justified pricing actions implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 that will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal '23 and new pricing that will take effect in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Another strong performance by Ardent Mills also proved to be an effective inflation hedge in our Q4 results. Slide 28 details our adjusted EPS bridge for the quarter compared to last year. The sales increase and recovery of overall operating margins was the primary driver of the increase in our adjusted EPS during the fourth quarter, contributing $0.09.","Pricing

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We also saw a $0.02 benefit from our equity method investment earnings, which increased 42.1% during the quarter to $48 million due to solid results from Ardent Mills as effective management at the joint venture allowed it to capitalize on volatile market conditions. A benefit from pension and postretirement non-service income and higher adjusted taxes were the additional drivers of our EPS change. The $0.65 in adjusted diluted EPS that we generated for the quarter brought our full-year adjusted EPS to $2.36, down 10.6% from fiscal '21. On a two-year compounded annualized basis, full-year fiscal '22 adjusted EPS increased 1.7%.","Equity Method

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to Slide 29, you can see our balance sheet and cash flow metrics for the quarter and full year. We feel good about ending the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of four times, which was generally in line with the target we outlined during our third-quarter call. We aim to continue decreasing this ratio moving forward as we prepare for more market volatility which I will discuss in more detail shortly.

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Lastly, we continued to prioritize returning capital to shareholders as we paid $582 million in dividends in fiscal '22. I'd now like to spend a minute talking about our guidance for fiscal '23. Slide 30 outlines our expectations for our three key metrics, including organic net sales growth of plus 4% to plus 5%, adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%, and adjusted EPS growth between plus 1% and plus 5%. In addition, we aim to continue reducing our long-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to three times, as I alluded to earlier.","Dividend

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"The macro-environment remains volatile, and this target reflects our strategy to maintain an even stronger balance sheet as we navigate continued headwinds moving forward, and we continue to remain committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating. Before we open the line up for questions, I want to unpack the assumptions behind our guidance, shown here on Slide 31. We expect the high inflationary environment we experienced in fiscal '22 to continue into fiscal '23, with levels in the low teens off of the fiscal '22 gross market inflation of 16%. As I noted, we have communicated additional inflation-justified pricing actions to help offset these elevated costs, which we anticipate being realized during the first and second quarters of fiscal '23, and we are keeping a close eye on how these actions impact elasticities.","Macro-

CAG,2022,4,David Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We forecast the environment to remain dynamic through fiscal '23, with the elasticities increasing from fiscal '22 levels but remaining below pre-COVID historical levels. From an investment perspective, we expect capex spend of approximately $500 million, as we prioritize reinvesting in the business as a lever to combat inflation with a focus on capacity expansion and productivity enablers. We also plan to increase our SG&A investment to support talent, infrastructure, and continued automation. Interest expense is anticipated to be roughly $410 million for the year; pension and postretirement income, approximately $25 million; and our tax rate estimate is approximately 24%.","Fiscal '23

The higher interest rate environment is the main driver of the expected interest expense increase in pension income decline. We anticipate Ardent Mills having another strong year but expect fiscal '23 results to moderate versus fiscal '22, particularly versus the elevated performance in the second half of fiscal '22.

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I'd like to start with the key messages we want to share with you this morning. As we navigate a dynamic external environment, our team delivered a solid Q3 that was largely in line with our expectations on the top line and adjusted EPS. We remained laser-focused on successfully executing the Conagra Way playbook by creating superior products and ensuring physical and mental availability to create lasting connections between consumers and our brands.

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The strength of our top line can be measured both in the absolute and relative to peers as we gain share in key categories on a one- and two-year basis. And it's important to note that in response to inflation-driven pricing that has been executed in the market to date, elasticities have been favorable to historical patterns, even more so than what we expected. Unit demand remained strong as consumers continue to recognize the superior relative value that our portfolio provides.

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, the environment isn't getting much easier in the near term. We now expect an additional $100 million of market inflation in Q4. The updated Q4 inflation forecast equates to a 26% increase versus two years ago. As we will detail further today, this higher-than-expected inflation is disproportionately impacting some of our strongest businesses, including meat snacks and frozen.","Market

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Keep in mind that these businesses rely on inputs, like protein and dairy, which are harder to offset in the short term, and that frozen requires more specialized temperature control transportation. But as we started to see this latest wave of inflation coming, we took action on pricing just as we have throughout the year. These new pricing moves go into effect in Q1 of fiscal '23 and are highly targeted toward frozen and protein snacks. These businesses have been distinguished by innovation-driven sales growth, favorable elasticities, continued share gains, and limited private label competition.","Businesses

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So, although we are experiencing pressure on our total company margins near term, we will see the benefits of the new pricing actions we've taken to offset this latest wave of inflation beginning in Q1 of fiscal '23. With this context, we're updating our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Our updated outlook reflects expectations for continued strong consumer demand for our product and lower-than-historical elasticities, as well as the further increase in our gross inflation expectations for the year and the timing of the related pricing actions. Specifically, we now expect organic net sales for the year to be plus 4%, and we project adjusted diluted EPS to land at about $2.35, which translates to approximately $2.65 of earnings power when taking into account the impact of the lag between inflation and our in-market pricing this fiscal year.","Total

We also continued to gain share in the quarter with our category weighted share growth up on both a one- and two-year basis. And on a relative basis, our share performance continued to compare favorably to the industry overall and to our largest peers.

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"If you take a look at the chart on the right, the share gains in our frozen and snacks domains were particularly notable. As you can see on Slide 9, our performance in frozen and snacks has driven our total Conagra share gains fiscal year to date and during the third quarter. Importantly, our categories are healthy, attractive, and growing. As you can see from the chart on the left, our frozen and snacks domains have grown nearly 8% and 9% during the fiscal year to date and third quarter, respectively.","Share

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So, we're not just gaining share, we're gaining share in some of the most attractive parts of the store. These results are holding, notwithstanding our need to put significant inflation-driven pricing into the market. On Slide 10, you can see the extent of our recent actions, which increased in Q3 and have accelerated over the last five weeks. On-shelf prices for our brands rose across all three domestic retail domains compared to the same period a year ago with inflation-driven price increases most concentrated in frozen and protein snacks.","Gaining

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We implement these pricing actions, we're watching the impact on volumes closely, and we are pleased that the price elasticity has remained below historical levels. Slide 11 demonstrates that unit sales have remained consistently positive on a two-year basis, even as the on-shelf prices for our brands have increased. This dynamic is a testament to the fact that despite the broad-based inflationary environment we're operating in, the targeted nature of our inflation-driven pricing actions and the superior relative value of our products continue to resonate with our customers and consumers. A great example of this is our Banquet brand in our frozen business.","Pricing

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we've discussed before, the Banquet brand is a mainstay in American households and has undergone considerable modernization to ensure that the brand delivers on its promise of relevant flavors, hearty portions, and a great value. Consumers see the relative quality and availability of our Banquet products and continue to choose Banquet despite inflation-driven price increases. Banquet's volume has remained consistent as prices went up in stark contrast to a key competitor. We see a similar story in our snacks domain with Slim Jim, another brand that has made lasting connections with its consumers through perpetual modernization, relevancy, and availability.","Banquet

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Despite the increased cost of protein and associated pricing actions, Slim Jim volumes have increased considerably, far outpacing a key competitor. In addition to strong relative performance compared with other branded products, we also continue to maintain share relative to private label products. Slide 14 shows private label dollar share across the edible industry at large, across the categories in which Conagra competes, and across Conagra's frozen and snacking categories specifically. Two things stand out about this chart.","Despite

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"First, we compete in parts of the store with less private label penetration than the edible space at large. And second, the share of private label sales has remained stable amid the highly inflationary environment over the past several years. We believe the data shows that consumers are finding comfort in the quality, reliability, and familiarity that national brands provide, particularly modernized brands like those in our portfolio.

Slide 15 shows the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and a modernized portfolio. During the third quarter, our innovation outperformed with the strong results we delivered in the year-ago period. And once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including with toppings, frozen vegetables, and frozen plant-based meat alternatives.","Innovation, Disciplined Approach, New Products, Modernized Portfolio, Category Performance",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And we have another exciting lineup of new innovations set to hit the shelves during fiscal 2023. The new products you see on Slide 16 are already being accepted by customers who have come to respect the innovation and marketing engine at Conagra and our ability to drive demand in key categories. Our ongoing investments in e-commerce also continue to yield strong results in the third quarter. We delivered compelling quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business as we outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth in Q3, building on our momentum from fiscal 2021.","Innovation, Marketing, E-commerce, Growth, Sales",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Looking at the chart on the right, you can see that our e-commerce business has continued to grow as a percentage of our total retail sales as we continue to invest behind supporting our brands. I'd like to briefly detail our performance across our three retail domains, starting with our frozen business on Slide 18. Frozen continues to be one of the strongest businesses in our portfolio and offers convenience and quality that make it the perfect fit for today's consumer. In Q3, we continued to deliver strong growth on both a one- and two-year basis.","E-commerce, Growth, Retail Sales, Investment, Quality",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And within this domain, meat substitutes, single-serve meals, desserts, and multi-serve meals were the main drivers of our results. Driven by the appeal of our products to the consumer and the investments we've made in brand building and innovation, our leading frozen portfolio again grew share in Q3, both in the domain overall and within key categories.

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Our Snacks portfolio is gaining share in this large and growing domain. We delivered share gains in multiple snack categories, including several popcorn categories, meat snacks, and hot cocoa. Our staples retail sales have also been growing over a two-year period, and that trend continued in Q3. Specifically, we saw very large increases in retail sales for refrigerated whipped toppings and cooking spray, both of which were up over 25% in Q3 on a two-year basis.","Growth,

CAG,2022,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The health of our business is what will enable us to deliver profitable growth for the long term. In the immediate, however, we face a volatile cost environment that continues to be very challenging. As the third quarter unfolded, our expectations for full year fiscal 2022 gross inflation increased from approximately 14% to approximately 16%.

On a two-year basis, Q4 gross inflation is expected to be an unprecedented 26%. And as I noted earlier, these incremental costs are disproportionately impacting our strong frozen and snacks businesses, both rely on inputs like protein and dairy, which are harder to offset in the short term and, in the case of frozen, require specialized temperature-controlled transportation.","Inflation, Costs, Businesses, Transportation, Short-Term",Conagra Brands

We now expect organic net sales growth of approximately 4%, adjusted operating margin to be approximately 14.5%, adjusted EPS to be approximately $2.35, and, as I just mentioned, we're updating our gross inflation guidance to approximately 16%. We're also providing guidance for the fourth quarter to reflect the higher-estimated inflation and the lag in the offsetting pricing actions.

While accelerated inflation has put pressure on our near-term earnings, we're confident in our ability to offset the impact with additional inflation-driven pricing actions.

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Sean. And good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our quarterly results at a summary level as shown here on Slide 28.

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We experienced better-than-anticipated elasticities on volume in the face of our inflation-driven price increases. Inflation pressures accelerated as Q3 unfolded as reflected in our Q3 operating margin. At the same time, our Ardent Mills joint venture reflected in the equity earnings line had a strong quarter, driven by favorable market conditions. Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.58 was largely in line with our expectations, down 1.7% versus prior year and up 11.1% on a two-year compounded growth basis.","Elasticities, Inflation, Operating Margin, Ardent Mills, Adjusted EPS",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Overall, a very solid Q3 financial performance, given the volatile operating environment. We show a breakdown of our Q3 net sales bridge on Slide 29. Our 6% organic net sales growth was driven by a strong price mix increase of 8.6%, reflecting the inflation-driven pricing actions we have taken in every segment of our business over the last year. Volume declined 2.6%, primarily due to the elasticity impacts of the price increases, along with supply constraints on certain refrigerated and frozen products.","Solid
Financial Performance, Q3 Net Sales Bridge, Price Mix Increase, Volume Decline, Elasticity Impacts",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Looking at reported net sales drivers, the divestitures of our peanut butter and egg beaters businesses drove an 80 basis-point decline, and foreign exchange was an additional 10 basis-point headwind. Together, these factors contributed to 5.1% growth in total Conagra net sales for the quarter versus a year ago. Slide 30 shows our Q3 net sales summary by reporting segment on a one- and two-year basis. We delivered organic net sales growth across each of our segments this quarter due to inflation-driven pricing and continued strong consumer demand.","Divestitures, Foreign Exchange, Net Sales Growth, Consumer Demand, Segment Performance",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Growth was particularly strong within our foodservice segment, where volume continued to rebound as restaurant traffic recovers from the impact of COVID-19. Foodservice third quarter organic net sales were in line with pre-COVID sales levels. Within our two domestic retail businesses, both grocery and snacks, and refrigerated and frozen, delivered strong price mix results for the quarter. Volumes were down a bit more in refrigerated and frozen than in grocery and snacks as we had some higher-than-expected supply disruptions in refrigerated and frozen in the quarter associated with labor and materials challenges.","Growth,

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"But we expect this dynamic to improve as we progress through Q4. For Total Conagra, organic net sales grew at a two-year compounded growth rate of 7.8% in the third quarter. We show the operating profit and margin summary of each of our reporting segments on Slide 31.

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"As you can see from our results, inflation and cost pressures were most concentrated in our refrigerated and frozen segment this quarter. I have a slide later in my remarks with specifics. But at a summary level, as Q3 unfolded, we began to experience higher-than-anticipated inflation on protein and higher cost in the temperature-controlled transportation network, both of which are harder to offset in the short term. But as you heard from Sean, our frozen businesses continue to win with consumers.","Inflation, Cost Pressures, Refrigerated and Frozen Segment, Protein Prices, Temperature-Controlled

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"While we look forward to getting back to a more normalized cost environment, we believe that our frozen portfolio is well-positioned to support the additional price increases that the current inflationary environment require. We've recently announced new pricing actions for our frozen businesses, as well as for our protein snacking businesses, which are also experiencing elevated levels of inflation. We will see the benefits of these new pricing actions in Q1 of fiscal year '23. Page 32 summarizes Total Conagra operating margin, excluding Ardent Mills for the third quarter.","Frozen

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,This page really highlights the significant impact that inflation had on the business in the third quarter. Q3 total market inflation was 15.4% and negatively impacted operating margin by 10.6 percentage points in the quarter. This inflation level was higher than what we estimated when we discussed our outlook with you following Q2. And it's driven the additional pricing actions I just mentioned.,"Inflation

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"The good news is that our 8.6% increase in price mix in sales translated to 5.7 percentage points of operating margin improvement in the quarter. We also delivered 1.5 percentage points of productivity improvement, net of operational offsets, in the quarter. Our teams were able to deliver this level of net productivity even in the face of meaningful labor disruption. The level of base productivity we achieved in our plants and our production output were both challenged in Q3 due to omicron-related labor disruption.","Price

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"But with the labor situation now starting to stabilize, we expect these headwinds to abate as we progress through Q4.

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We also had lower SG&A and A&P costs in the quarter. Q3 EPS was also favorably impacted by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt and by a very strong quarter from Ardent Mills. Given the nature of Ardent's business, it can benefit from volatile market conditions. Although Ardent income is recorded below operating margin in our financial statements, it is a cash-generating business that has performed well in this highly inflationary environment.","Lower

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"As you've seen in our materials this morning, the highly inflationary environment has caused us to reduce our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. However, we believe it's important to provide some additional details on how we view the underlying earnings power of our portfolio, which we believe is strong. On a pro forma basis, we estimate that fiscal '22 adjusted EPS approximate $2.65 versus the updated guidance of $2.35 we're sharing today. So, what does that $2.65 represent? First, as you can see on the chart, it incorporates the impact of the updated market inflation estimate we're now expecting in Q4, driving a reduction in our previous EPS estimate of about $0.18.","Underlying Earning Power, Fiscal '22 Adjusted EPS, Market Inflation Estimate, Q4 Performance, Pro

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"The $2.65 also reflects estimated favorability of approximately $0.03 versus the previous full year EPS estimate for Ardent Mills. Beyond those items, the $2.65 reflects our estimate of all the pricing lags we faced this fiscal year. As you've heard us discuss in recent quarters, the reality of a CPG food business is that inflation hits the P&L before a corresponding pricing response can be executed with customers. Generally, that lag is about 90 days.","Ardent

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"As you can see, the expected inflation rate for Q4 is the biggest delta compared to our previous expectations. If you look at the chart on the right, Q4 inflation is expected to be approximately 26% versus two years ago. Clearly, an unprecedented level of market inflation that we are managing through. Slide 36 goes into more detail on where we saw this inflation impact on our supply chain most severely in the third quarter and where the bulk of the incremental 100 million of new inflation is coming from.","Q4

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"As Sean and I have both mentioned, transportation and proteins were particularly challenging in Q3, and remained so as we started Q4. Dairy has also been a headwind versus our prior expectations. Let's talk a bit more about each of these. Beginning with transportation, Q3 costs were heavily impacted by driver and truck availability, which resulted in more inflationary pressures from spot market usage and rates.","Transportation Costs, Driver Availability, Truck Availability, Dairy Headwind, Q4 Impact",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Additionally, as you are all aware, fuel prices were driven up significantly during the quarter due to unforeseen worldwide events. With respect to proteins and dairy, we also saw Q3 inflation at rates higher than previously forecasted. Meat-based proteins are difficult to hedge, and current industry freezer inventory positions are at multi-year lows. This supply dynamic limits our ability to build our freezer stock inventory, which is our typical coverage strategy.","Fuel

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"For a bit more perspective on cost, our total meat-based protein spend in fiscal '21 approximated $675 million. For fiscal '22, we now estimate total meat-based protein market inflation of approximately 50%, which is approximately $340 million of additional market cost in this one commodity area, driving nearly 40% of our total gross materials inflation in fiscal '22. In summary, these three categories alone are estimated to drive $0.16 of the incremental gross cost inflation we're now expecting for Q4.

CAG,2022,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"As outlined on Slide 37, we reduced net debt by approximately $240 million in Q3, getting our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 4.2 times. As more of our pricing actions flow through our balance sheet in the fourth quarter, we expect this leverage ratio to drop to approximately 3.9 times. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and to our long-term net leverage target of roughly 3.5 times.

Because of the incremental inflation we have discussed today and the additional lag in the pricing actions, we are estimating Q4 EPS to approximate $0.64, a strong increase of 18.5% versus the prior year.

CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"First, as you all know, the external environment has continued to be highly dynamic. But our team remained extremely agile in the quarter and executed the Conagra Way playbook. We navigated the ongoing complexity and delivered strong net sales growth anchored in elevated consumer demand that continued to exceed our ability to supply, inflation-driven pricing actions and lower-than-expected elasticities. While our net sales exceeded our expectations, margin pressure in the second quarter was also higher than expected driven by three key factors.","External

CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"First, while we anticipated elevated inflation during the second quarter, it was higher than our forecast. Second, we experienced some additional transitory supply chain costs related to the current environment. And third, in the face of elevated consumer demand that continue to outpace our ability to supply, we elected to make investments to service orders and maximize product availability for our consumers.

CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I continue to be impressed by our team's commitment and I'm grateful for their ongoing dedication. Looking at Slide 10. You can see that our strong performance in the second quarter was broad based.

CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Household penetration was also up this quarter, building upon the significant number of new consumers we've acquired over the past two years. Total Conagra household penetration was up 59 basis points on a two-year basis and our category share increased 41 basis points. In addition to increasing household penetration and acquiring new consumers, we are retaining our existing consumers, as demonstrated by our repeat rates.

CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As the chart on the right of Slide 11 shows, our consumers keep coming back for more. As we execute our Conagra Way playbook, innovation remained a key to our success across the portfolio in Q2. Slide 12 highlights the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new product and modernizing our portfolio. During the second quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year ago period.","Innovation, Consumer Loyalty, Conagra Way Playbook, Disciplined Approach, New Product Development",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We continue to invest in new product quality and it's supporting our innovation launches with deeper, more meaningful consumer connections. Once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including snacks, sweet treats, sauces and marinades and frozen vegetables. Slide 13 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce continued to yield strong results. We again delivered strong quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business and e-commerce accounted for a larger percentage of our overall retail sales than our peers.","Investment in New Product Quality, Consumer Connections, Innovation Launches, E-Commerce Growth,

CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the second quarter, just as we did in the first quarter of 2022 and throughout fiscal 2021. As we mentioned earlier, our strong net sales growth was driven by elevated consumer demand, favorable elasticities and inflation-driven pricing actions. On Slide 14, you can see the extent of our pricing actions in the first half of the fiscal year. During this period, our on-shelf prices rose across all three domestic retail domains.","E-commerce sales growth, Consumer demand, Pricing actions, Inflation, Elasticities",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And, as Dave will discuss shortly, the pricing flowed through the P&L. As you can see on Slide 15, price elasticity has been fairly low. It's been favorable to our expectations. Consumers continued to see the tremendous value of our products relative to other food options, a concept I will elaborate on in a few minutes.","Consumer

CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Now, let's turn to the path ahead. You can see on Slide 17 we currently expect gross inflation to be approximately 14% for fiscal 2022 compared to the approximately 11% we anticipated at the time of our first quarter call. This is a large increase and we're taking actions to offset the increase while still investing in the long-term health of our business. To help manage our increasing inflation, we're taking incremental pricing actions, including list price increases and modified merchandising plans.","Inflation, Pricing actions, Sales growth, Gross inflation, Business investment",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Many of these actions have already been announced to our customers. As a reminder, there is a lag in timing between the impact of inflation and our ability to execute pricing adjustments based on that inflation. As a result, the incremental price increases will go into effect in the second half of the year with the most significant impact during the fourth quarter. While it's easy to get caught up in the quarter-to-quarter impact of inflation and pricing, it's important to keep focused on the big picture.","Inflation, Pricing actions, Sales growth, Timing, Focus",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The long-term success of our business is driven by how consumers, particularly younger consumers, respond to our products. And when you take a step back to evaluate the broader environment and how our portfolio delivers against the needs of the modern consumer, we believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned for the future. As we've detailed many times before, Conagra's on-trend portfolio filled with modern food attributes is winning with younger consumers. And our confidence is underpinned by the many changes we're seeing in consumer behavior that are proving to be structural, especially given that these changes are driven by younger consumers that represent the most significant opportunity for long-term value creation.","Consumer
behavior, Modern food attributes, Structural changes, Long-term value creation, Younger consumers",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Younger consumers represent a large and growing part of the U.S. population and they want to optimize the value that they get for the money they spend on food. A large part of optimizing their food spending includes shifting more dollars from eating away from home to eating at home. As they make that trade, they're choosing national brands.","Younger
consumers, Food spending, Optimization, National brands, Eating habits",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And we believe Conagra is ideally positioned to experience an outsized benefit from these behaviors given the relationship our brands are forming with younger consumers. Overall, Conagra is delivering superior relative value to consumers compared to both away-from-home options and store brands. Let's take a closer look at these trends, starting with the population changes. Slide 20 highlights the demographic shift underway in the U.S.","Demographic shift, Population changes, Consumer behavior, Brand formation, Value creation",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Millennial and Gen Z consumers are a large and growing cohort. These consumers are starting to settle down, buy homes and start families. As we presented in the past, when people enter the family formation phase, they increase the amount of food they eat at home with an outsized increase in the consumption of frozen foods. And what we find particularly important about reaching Millennial and Gen Z consumers is that we believe they will remain more value focused than their predecessors.","Millennials, Gen Z, Family formation, Food consumption, Value focus",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"First, let's talk about the near term. As you can see in the chart on the left, Millennial and Gen Z consumers are earlier in their careers and earning less than the older generations of working-age people. This is natural, but it bodes well for food-at-home trends in the shorter term. We believe that even as foodservice bounces back, younger consumers will be value conscious in their food choices.","Younger

CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,Fewer younger consumers are expected to achieve the financial success of the generations before them. The data on the right suggests that Millennials are more likely to earn less than their parents. We believe this means that these savvy consumers will look to stretch their food dollars further even as they age. The data also shows that younger consumers are already eating more at home.,"Younger
consumers, Financial success, Food spending, Eating habits, Stretching food dollars",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Compared to the population as a whole, Gen Z and Millennials have decreased restaurant visits more and sourced a larger percentage of their meals at home. As these younger consumers have made the shift to at-home eating, the data shows that they're finding comfort in the quality, reliability and familiarity that national brands provide. We believe this makes a lot of sense. National brands provide value while replicating many of the on-trend flavors and modern food attributes that consumers are used to experiencing in away-from-home dining.","Younger
consumers, Eating habits, National brands, Value, Familiarity",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"When consumers make trades like away-from-home to in-home eating, trust is paramount. In short, national brands, particularly modernized brands like those in our portfolio, deliver on this trust imperative and that's because they offer superior relative value versus other food options. As consumers seek to stretch their household balance sheets in the face of broad-based inflation, one of the single largest levers available to them is the reduction in spending on food away from home as food-away-from-home prices are typically over three and a half times more expensive than food-at-home prices. This trade will likely become even more important for consumers as food-away-from-home prices have already increased faster than at-home prices in calendar 2021 and they are expected to increase at nearly twice the rate as at-home prices in calendar year 2022.","Trust,

CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Our aggressive modernization of the Conagra portfolio over the past several years has put us in a strong position to capitalize on these structural shifts. Our portfolio has shown its competitive advantage with excellent trial, depth of repeat and share gain performance. Overall, we believe Conagra is well positioned to leverage these shifts to create meaningful value for shareholders. And Slide 25 shows you the data to support our claim.","Modernization, Portfolio, Competitive advantage, Value creation, Shareholder value",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Conagra is attracting more younger consumers than our peers and getting them to repeat at more attractive rates.

CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Sean and good morning, everybody. I'll start by going over some highlights from the quarter shown on Slide 28.

CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"And second, elasticities were better than anticipated. However, we also continued to see inflation rise across a number of key inputs and the dynamic macro environment created challenging conditions for the supply chain. The team remained agile in response to these dynamics, including the decision to make additional investments during the quarter to meet the elevated demand and maximize the food supply to our consumers. Overall, our actions favorably impacted our top line during the quarter with organic net sales up 2.6% compared to the year ago period.","Consumer
demand, Elasticities, Inflation, Supply chain, Top line",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"An important part of the top line success we've realized throughout the pandemic is our ongoing commitment to the Conagra Way. We've remained focused on building and maintaining strong brands across the portfolio. We continued these efforts in the second quarter with continued product innovation and by further increasing our spending on advertising and promotion, primarily focusing on e-commerce investments. We show a breakdown of our net sales on Slide 29.","Ongoing
commitment, Building strong brands, Product innovation, Advertising and promotion, Net sales",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"The 4.2% decline in volume was primarily due to the lapping of the prior-year surge in demand during an earlier stage in the COVID-19 pandemic as volume increased approximately 1% on a two-year CAGR. The second quarter volume decline was more than offset by the very favorable impact of brand mix and inflation-driven pricing actions we realized this quarter, driving an overall organic net sales growth of 2.6%. On last quarter's call, we noted that the domestic retail pricing actions were just starting to be reflected on shelves at the end of the first quarter. Those increases were reflected in our P&L this quarter, driving the 6.8% increase in price mix.","Volume

CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"The divestitures of our H.K. Anderson business, the Peter Pan peanut butter business and the Egg Beaters business resulted in a 70-basis-point decline and foreign exchange drove a 20-basis-point benefit. Together, all these factors contributed to a 2.1% increase in total Conagra net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago.

CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"As you can see, we continue to deliver strong two-year compounded net sales growth in each of our three retail segments, which resulted in a two-year compounded organic net sales growth of 5.3% for the total company. You can see the puts and takes of our operating margin on Slide 31. We drove a 6.2 percentage point benefit from improved price mix, supply chain-realized productivity, cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition and lower pandemic-related expenses. Netted within the 6.2% are the additional investments we made to service orders and maximize product availability.","Strong

CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"These investments reflect the dynamic environment and actions we've taken to respond to it. This includes decisions to utilize more third-party transportation and warehousing vendors for some of our frozen products, incurring incremental cost to move product around our distribution network to better align with customer order patterns and delaying a plant consolidation productivity program to maximize current production. The 6.2% also includes transitory supply chain costs such as higher inventory write-offs and increased overtime to support operations. The 6.2 percentage point benefit was more than offset by an inflation headwind of 11 percentage points.","Investments, Dynamic environment, Customer order patterns, Supply chain costs, Inflation headwind",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"The second quarter gross inflation rate of 16.4% of cost of goods sold was approximately 100 basis points or $20 million higher than expected, driven by higher-than-anticipated increases in proteins and transportation, which are both difficult to hedge. The combination of the favorable margin levers, our choiceful supply chain investments and inflation headwinds resulted in adjusted gross margin declining by 483 basis points. Our operating margin was further impacted by 20 basis points due to our increased A&P investment during the quarter, as I mentioned earlier. You can see how these elevated costs impacted each of our reporting segments on Slide 32.","Gross
inflation rate, Cost of goods sold, Adjusted gross margin, Operating margin, A&P investment",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"While each segment was impacted, our Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted the most with adjusted operating margin down 707 basis points primarily due to outsized materials inflation and the additional investment incurred to service orders and get food delivered to consumers. We are confident that we will improve overall operating margins in the second half as we execute our additional pricing actions to offset the higher inflation rates. As you can see on Slide 33, our second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.64 was heavily impacted by the input cost inflation across our portfolio. Even though the benefits of our first quarter pricing flowed through the P&L this quarter, the incremental inflation we incurred in the second quarter created an additional headwind.","Refrigerated & Frozen segment, Adjusted operating margin, Materials inflation, Additional
investment, Adjusted EPS",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"In response, we announced additional pricing to customers in early Q3 during December. Although we have yet another lag before this pricing benefits the P&L, we expect to realize benefits from these pricing actions in late Q3 with most of the impact in Q4. Also, our Ardent Mills joint venture had another good quarter and delivered EPS benefit versus the prior year. We realized lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count due to our share repurchases in prior quarters.","Additional pricing, P&L impact, Ardent Mills joint venture, Net interest expense, Share

CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to Slide 34. I want to unpack how Q2 adjusted EPS landed versus our expectations. Our second quarter adjusted EPS came in lower than we originally had anticipated due to two main factors. First, as previously mentioned, inflation came in higher by approximately 100 basis points of cost of goods sold or approximately $0.02 to $0.03 of EPS.","Inflation, Adjusted EPS, Original expectations, Cost of goods sold, Main factors",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"While we have announced additional pricing actions for the second half to offset the incremental inflation, the timing of these benefits is naturally lagging behind the higher inflation. Second, the cost we elected to incur to service orders, coupled with the additional transitory supply chain costs I described earlier, led to another $0.02 to $0.03 impact on our adjusted EPS. We are forecasting these service and transitory cost dynamics to improve as the second half progresses. Looking at Slide 35, we ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.3x, which is in line with the seasonal increase in leverage expected for the second quarter.","Additional pricing actions, Incremental inflation, Transitory supply chain costs, Adjusted EPS
impact, Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We expect to generate strong free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year and expect to end the year with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.7 to 3.8 times. We remain committed to a longer-term net leverage target of approximately 3.5 times and to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. I want to close today by reviewing the factors driving the updated guidance we issued this morning, which is shown here on Slide 36. I'll start by saying that we remain confident in our ability to achieve approximately $2.50 in adjusted EPS for the full fiscal year.","Strong
free cash flow, Net leverage ratio, Investment-grade credit rating, Updated guidance, Adjusted EPS",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"As the macro environment continues to be very dynamic, our expectations for the path to achieve that target have shifted. We are increasing our organic net sales growth guidance to approximately 3% to reflect our stronger-than-expected performance year-to-date as well as our incremental pricing actions in the second half. We are lowering our adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 15 and a half percent. We expect the incremental sales and pricing actions in the second half to offset the dollar impact of the incremental net inflation and other supply chain costs.","Organic
net sales growth, Adjusted operating margin, Incremental pricing actions, Net inflation, Supply
chain costs",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We have increased our gross inflation expectations to approximately 14%, largely driven by higher estimated costs versus the previous estimate for proteins, transportation, dairy and resin. We will continue to monitor these input costs closely and will be quick to respond using all available margin levers. As Sean detailed, price elasticity has been favorable to our expectations so far. As we have explained previously, there is a lag in timing between when we experience inflation, take actions, including pricing, to offset the dollar impact of the inflation and when we see those actions flow through our financial results.","Gross
inflation expectations, Input costs, Price elasticity, Timing of actions, Financial results",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,2,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"With respect to the additional pricing actions we have announced for the second half of fiscal '22, we expect to realize a small amount late in the third quarter and the full benefits from these price increases in the fourth quarter. We therefore expect our third quarter margins to be roughly in line with second quarter margins with an increase in operating margins in Q4 as the pricing catches up with inflation and the impact of the lag is reduced. Our guidance also assumes that the end-to-end supply chain will continue to operate effectively as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Before turning it over to the operator for Q&A, I would like to reiterate that confidence in our ability to reach our earnings goal is based on the strength of our business at its core to manufacture and deliver foods that people enjoy.","Additional pricing actions, Operating margins, Supply chain, COVID-19 pandemic, Business strength",Conagra Brands

CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We believe that consumer demand, coupled with additional pricing and cost-saving actions, will enable us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of about $2.50. So with that as the backdrop, let's jump right in. We know that our long-term performance is a function of the caliber and engagement of our team, and that has never been more true than today.

CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As a result of our team's continued hard work and dedication, we've been able to successfully execute through sustained elevated demand and challenging supply conditions. First, as we've already mentioned, consumer demand has remained at higher levels than we expected due to macro forces, as well as the unique position of our portfolio. This is a great problem to have, but it increases the demands on our supply chain at a time when the industry is navigating labor shortages, material supply issues and transportation cost and congestion challenges. Taken together, these factors created an upper control limit on the amount of product we could produce and ship in Q1.","Consumer

The Conagra Way playbook to portfolio modernization remains our North Star in any operating environment. Regardless of the external factors that may influence short-term demand and supply dynamics in any given quarter, we define long-term success as creating meaningful and lasting connections between consumers and our brands.","Dynamic

CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We believe that our playbook is the most effective framework for delivering on that objective. Those of you who have followed us for a while will recall that our modern approach to brand building is more comprehensive than legacy industry practices. Instead of anchoring our brand building predominantly in broadcast advertising that pushes new messages on old products, we anchor our investments and our efforts first in developing new modern and superior items. Then once we've created these more modern and provocative products, we invest to drive the physical availability of those items in-store and online.","Brand

This comprehensive approach and unwavering commitment to modernizing and premiumizing our portfolio continues to pay off and enables us to better manage our brands within any environment. And as you can see on Slide 8, our team delivered solid results during the first quarter.

CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we mentioned earlier, our solid top-line performance during the first quarter was driven by strong demand, robust brand-building investments and inflation-justified pricing actions. Slide 12 details the extent of our pricing actions to date. A few key points to keep in mind. First, we began implementing actions on some of our domestic retail products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to the inflation we began to experience last fiscal year.","Inflation, Pricing actions, Brand-building investments, Top-line performance, Demand",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The majority of our domestic retail pricing actions, however, just started to hit the market at the end of Q1 in response to the inflation we spoke to you about on our Q4 earnings call in July. As a result, the benefit in the quarter is less than what we expect to see going forward.

I'd like to briefly unpack these factors, starting with the update to our inflation expectations. As you can see on Slide 14, we currently expect gross inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal 2022, compared to the approximately 9% we anticipated at the time of our fourth-quarter call. The bulk of the incremental inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of proteins, edible fats and oils, grains and steel cans since our Q4 call.","Inflation expectations, Consumer demand, Cost savings actions, Gross inflation, Protein costs",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I want to emphasize that this is our best current estimate of gross inflation for the full year and does not account for the impact of supply chain productivity improvements or hedging. Dave will provide more color on inflation and the various levers we're able to pull to help offset its impact. Even in the face of this acutely inflationary environment, we remain squarely focused on continuing to invest in our brands and capturing the strong consumer demand. And we're pleased to share that the consumer demand we experienced during the first quarter exceeded our prior expectations.","Inflation, Supply
Chain, Investment, Consumer Demand, Gross Inflation",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As you can see on Slide 15, our total company retail sales on a two-year CAGR basis were up nearly 7% in the first quarter with strong growth across our frozen, snacks and staples domains. And when you peel back the onion further you find even more evidence to underscore the durable strength of our top-line performance. The chart on the left side of Slide 16 demonstrates that we continue to grow our household penetration during the first quarter, building upon the significant new consumer acquisition we've achieved over the past year and a half. But what I believe is even more encouraging is the chart on the right.","Retail Sales,

CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We didn't just acquire new consumers, we kept them. The data shows growth in repeat rates that demonstrates our new consumers discovered the incredible products and tremendous value proposition of our portfolio. We're proud that our products are resonating with consumers and that those shoppers keep coming back for more. Importantly, our performance on these metrics, household penetration and repeat rates has not only been strong in the absolute but relative to the competition as well.","Growth, Consumers,

CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We're also encouraged by the elasticity of demand for our portfolio, which has been better than previously expected. Slide 17 demonstrates that our pricing actions to date have had limited impact on demand. As I mentioned, most of our pricing actions taken to date began to appear on shelf at the end of Q1. And you can see how that dynamic is being reflected in the data for September, which is part of our second quarter.","Demand, Pricing

CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We continue to be cautiously optimistic that our elasticities will remain favorable as the full array of pricing enters the market. As evidenced by our strong penetration and repeat rates, a growing number of consumers have clearly discovered the convenience and value that our retail portfolio provides. Taken together, the net result of these factors I just detailed is the reaffirmation of our EPS guidance and margin and a few updates on how we expect to get there. We're increasing our organic net sales guidance to be approximately plus 1%, up from approximately flat at the time of our Q4 call.","Elasticity,

Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to briefly reinforce some of the longer-term tailwinds we believe will benefit us for years to come.

In particular, we know that annual frozen category spend per buyer increases in households with young kids, and it increases further as the kids grow up. Importantly, almost half of millennials have yet to begin having kids, and we fully expect their consumption of Conagra products will grow along with the growth of their families.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only served to accelerate these existing trends and create additional long-term growth drivers. One of the primary drivers for more at-home eating is the shifting workplace dynamics that are meaningfully changing weekday eating behavior.

CAG,2022,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As more people work from home or exit the workforce, the more likely these people are to eat at home, particularly on weekdays.

CAG,2022,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everybody. I'll start by going over some highlights from the quarter shown on Slide 21. As a reminder, our year-over-year comparisons reflect the lapping of extremely strong demand for at-home food consumption during the early months of the pandemic.

CAG,2022,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We are pleased with the overall results of the first quarter, which, as Sean discussed, reflected our ability to successfully navigate the current dynamic environment. Organic net sales declined by 0.4%, compared to a year ago and increased 7% on a two-year CAGR. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating profit both decreased year over year but were flat on a two-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the double-digit inflation experienced in the business during the quarter.

CAG,2022,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"These investments reflect our continued commitment to building and maintaining strong brands. Turning to Slide 22. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our net sales for the quarter. On an organic net-sales basis, the 0.4% decrease during the quarter was driven by a 2% decline in volume from lapping last year's elevated demand.","Strong Brands, Net
Sales, Quarterly Performance, Volume, Demand",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"This decline was almost entirely offset by favorable brand mix and the pricing actions we've taken to date in response to the inflationary environment. There are two items I want to call out on price/mix. First, as a reminder, the majority of our domestic retail pricing actions just started to hit shelves at the end of Q1. So the benefit in the quarter was limited compared to the benefits we expect to receive over the course of fiscal '22.","Brand Mix, Pricing
Actions, Inflationary Environment, Domestic Retail Pricing, Fiscal '22",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Second, our 1.6% benefit from price/mix laps a 70-basis-point benefit in the prior-year period that was associated with the true-up of fiscal '20 fourth-quarter trade expense accrual. Without that item, the current quarter's price mix benefit would have been plus 2.3%. Divestitures resulted in a 110-basis-point decline in net sales during the quarter, and foreign exchange provided a 50-basis-point benefit. Together, these factors drove a 1% decline in total Conagra net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago.","Price Mix,

CAG,2022,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 23 shows our net sales summary by segment, both on a year-over-year and a two-year compounded basis. As you can see, we've had strong two-year compounded net sales growth in each of our three retail segments with a slight decline in our food service segment. Net sales for the entire company have increased 7% on a two-year CAGR basis.

CAG,2022,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to adjusted operating margin. Slide 24 details the puts and takes of our first-quarter results. First-quarter inflation was 16.6%, driving our adjusted gross margin decline of 530 basis points compared to a year ago. We delivered 550 points of benefit from our margin lever actions in the quarter, inflation-justified pricing, supply chain realized productivity, cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition and lower pandemic-related expenses.","Inflation, Adjusted

CAG,2022,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"However, these benefits were more than offset by the very significant inflation. Note that the 16.6% inflation shown on the slide represents gross market inflation for Q1 and does not include hedging or sourcing benefits. We capture hedging as part of our realized productivity. For the first quarter, our net inflation inclusive of hedging was high single digits.","Inflation, Gross
Market Inflation, Net Inflation, Hedging, Sourcing Benefits",Conagra Brands
CAG,2022,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Our Q1 adjusted operating margin was also impacted by year-over-year changes to A&P and adjusted SG&A. As I previously mentioned, we continue to increase our investments in A&P in the quarter. The adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the quarter are shown on Slide 25. As a reminder, we expect our first quarter this fiscal year to benefit the least from our inflation-justified pricing actions.","Year-Over-Year

CAG,2022,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"It's also worth highlighting again that our adjusted operating profit is flat on a two-year basis. Over a two-year period, we have completely offset double-digit inflation while also increasing investment in the business. As you can see on Slide 26, our Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.50 was heavily impacted by inflation, as well as by a slightly higher tax rate. These headwinds were partially offset by strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count due to our share repurchases during the quarter.","Adjusted Operating

We now expect gross cost of goods sold inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal '22. We previously expected gross inflation of approximately 9%.

CAG,2021,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Dave will discuss the cost environment in more detail, but I want to reinforce that we are aggressively pulling on all of our levers to navigate the current inflationary environment. We began executing our aggressive response plan in fiscal 2021, given the inflation we were already seeing and talking to you about in Q3. The incremental inflation that arose as Q4 unfolded called for additional actions, and you can be assured that we've begun to respond accordingly.

CAG,2021,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We remain squarely focused on long-term value creation. But I also know that a more short-term focused question on all of your minds is, will Conagra take list pricing increases? And the short answer is yes. In fact, we began implementing pricing actions on some of our products in the fourth quarter related to the initial inflation we experienced. The very early read on the data from those actions is that our elasticities look good so far, and we have more pricing coming.","Long-term
value creation, List pricing increases, Pricing actions, Elasticities, Data read",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Because our pricing is being implemented strategically and thoughtfully, we're cautiously optimistic that our elasticities will remain strong as our full array of pricing enters the market in fiscal '22. As I mentioned last quarter and earlier in my presentation, we expect the negative impact of the cost inflation to hit our financials before the beneficial impact of our responsive actions, including our pricing. This timing mismatch is expected to be particularly impactful in H1 and more specifically in Q1. The resulting pressure on our first-half margins impact our full-year profit.","Strategic

CAG,2021,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And as you saw in the release, we're updating our fiscal '22 guidance as a result. Organic net sales growth is expected to be roughly flat to fiscal '21.

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter and full-year fiscal '21, which are shown on Slide 30. Before we get into the details, a reminder that our year-over-year results for the fourth quarter reflect the lapping of the onset of the pandemic in March, April, and May of fiscal '20 and the unprecedented surge in consumer demand during that time. Additionally, our Q4 fiscal '20 included a 53rd week, which also impacts comparisons to the year-ago period.","Highlights from the quarter and full-year fiscal '21, Year-over-year results for the fourth

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Overall, we are pleased with our performance as our results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. We delivered strong growth for the full fiscal year, including a 5.1% increase in organic net sales; adjusted operating profit of nearly $2 billion, up 7.4% versus fiscal '20; and operating margin of 17.5% for the year, an increase of more than 100 basis points versus fiscal '20; an adjusted EBITDA increase of 6.5%; and adjusted EPS growth of 15.8% for the year. Turning to Slide 31. You can see the net sales bridge for the fourth quarter and the full year.","Strong growth, Organic net sales, Adjusted operating profit, Operating margin, Adjusted
EBITDA",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Our 10.1% decrease in organic net sales during the quarter was driven by a 12.8% decline in volume due to the comparison to last year's demand surge. The impact of the volume decline was partially offset by a 2.7% benefit from favorable mix and the initial pricing actions we took in response to the elevated inflationary environment, which I will describe in further detail shortly. Divestitures drove a 150-basis-point decline to net sales for the quarter, and we faced an additional headwind of 560 basis points from the lapping of last year's 53rd week. Finally, we experienced a 50 basis point benefit from foreign exchange during the quarter.","Organic net
sales, Volume decline, Favorable mix, Inflationary environment, Divestitures",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Combined, these factors drove a 16.7% decline in net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago. The bottom half of the slide highlights the drivers of our net sales growth for full-year fiscal '21 versus the prior year with an increase in organic net sales of over 5% driven by volume growth and favorable price mix actions. Slide 32 outlines our net sales summary by segment. In the fourth quarter, net sales in our three retail segments declined on both a reported and organic basis due to lapping last year's surge in demand.","Net sales

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Conversely, our Foodservice segment grew considerably this quarter as restaurant traffic began to recover. For the full fiscal year, the strong performance in our three retail segments during the first three quarters of the year more than offset the decline in Q4, while our Foodservice segment was negatively impacted by reduced demand for away-from-home eating for most of the year. Slide 33 shows the puts and takes of our fourth-quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin. As you can see, our team did a great job pulling on our margin levers in the quarter, including taking price increases in several retail categories driving favorable mix throughout the portfolio, capturing $20 million of synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition, managing our COVID-19-related costs, which were $36 million in the quarter and continuing to drive strong supply chain productivity.","Foodservice

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Despite these efforts, however, we were unable to fully offset cost of goods sold inflation in the quarter. COGS inflation continued to accelerate as the quarter progressed, ultimately landing at 8.6%, which was above the Q4 expectations we shared at the end of Q3. We also increased our A&P by 27% in the quarter as we continue to identify opportunities for strong ROIs on these investments, particularly within e-commerce. Finally, SG&A was a slight margin headwind in the quarter as SG&A dollars decreased at a lower rate than our reported net sales.","Cost of goods

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Cost control and a disciplined approach to SG&A remain a hallmark of our culture here at Conagra. On Slide 34, we detail the operating profit and margin for our segments for the quarter and the full year. Each of our three retail segments declined versus last year's fourth quarter, driven by the lapping of last year's surge in demand and 53rd week, as well as increased cost of goods sold inflation. However, each retail segment reported higher adjusted operating profit than the fourth quarter of fiscal '19, demonstrating the sustained progress we have made.","Cost control,

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"As I noted earlier, our adjusted EPS of $0.54 was in line with our expectations despite higher-than-expected inflation. The decline in adjusted operating profit and the impact of last year's 53rd week affected our results by $0.23 and $0.05, respectively, shown here on Slide 35. These headwinds were partially offset by strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count resulting from our Q3 share repurchase.

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we closed the sale of our Egg Beaters liquid egg business at the end of the fourth quarter. Given the timing of the closure, this sale had a minimal impact on our Q4 results, but we expect there to be an annualized net sales impact of roughly $40 million going forward. This will primarily be reflected in our refrigerated and frozen segment with small effects on our international and foodservice segments. We estimate that the sale will have a total annualized impact on our EPS of approximately $0.01.","Sale of Egg

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"As Sean mentioned, we are pleased with our current position in the market and are confident in our ability to continue executing the Conagra Way to drive profitable growth as we look ahead. However, we have experienced an acceleration of inflation since Q3. And due to the timing lag between when this inflation hits our P&L and when the benefits of our pricing and productivity actions take effect, we do not expect to fully offset the impact of these cost increases in time to meet our prior fiscal '22 EPS projections. We do expect, however, second-half fiscal '22 EPS to be in line with what we assumed for the second half in our prior guidance.","Current market

For fiscal '22, we now expect organic net sales growth approximately flat to fiscal '21, adjusted operating margin of approximately 16%, and adjusted EPS of approximately $2.50. While this guidance is our best estimate of how we will perform in fiscal '22, our ultimate performance will be highly dependent on four critical factors: first, how consumers purchase food as restaurants, offices, and schools continue to reopen; second, the level of inflation we ultimately experience; third, the elasticity impact as consumers respond to higher prices; and finally, the ability of our end-to-end supply chain to continue to operate effectively.

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"When we initially gave our fiscal '22 targets at our Investor Day in April of 2019, our models assumed an annual inflation rate of around 3%. At the time of our third-quarter call in April of 2021, we expected fiscal '22 inflation to come in at twice that level around 6%. Importantly, as of the Q3 call, we still saw a path to deliver our fiscal '22 targets. Not only is our brand health strong as evidenced by the strong consumer demand, we know how to pull on all margin levers.","Inflation rate,

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"That said, there is a limit to how much cost increase we can absorb in the short term given the timing lag that Sean and I have discussed. And as all of you know, inflation has continued to rise sharply since April. We now currently expect fiscal '22 inflation to come in around 9%. The difference between the 6% we expected a few months ago and the 9% we expect today equates to approximately $255 million in additional costs during fiscal '22.","Cost increase,
Timing lag, Fiscal '22 inflation, Additional costs, Impact on fiscal '22",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The bulk of this inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of edible fats and oils, proteins, packaging, and transportation since the timing of our Q3 call. While we are able to hedge some of our inputs, others, particularly certain proteins, are not easily hedged. As Sean mentioned, we have various levers at our disposal that we are actively and strategically pulling to manage this inflation, but the profit lag effect is real. For example, certain pricing actions can take 90 days to enact or a cost savings initiative may not be actionable until later in the year when a contract is up for review.","Inflation,

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So while we anticipate being able to successfully manage inflation over time, the continued sharp increases to input costs we are currently experiencing will take some time to overcome. And given our disciplined approach to managing the business for the long term, we will not reduce investments to meet the guidance target at the expense of the long-term health of our business.

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"First, consistent with our prior divestitures, we are removing $0.01 for the Egg Beaters divestiture that we announced today. Second, the largest driver of the change is the significant $0.41 per share increase in inflation since Q3 that I just discussed. And finally, we have identified many ways to manage and offset this increased inflation, including additional productivity and cost savings initiatives, as well as substantial pricing actions that Sean and I have discussed. Again, the bulk of these margin offsets will start to hit our P&L in the second quarter and continue to increase in the second half, which is why we expect second-half EPS to be in line with what we assumed for second-half EPS in our prior fiscal '22 guidance.","Inflation increase,

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 41 lays out some of the key assumptions that underlie our fiscal '22 expectations. On the top line, we expect organic net sales growth to be stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first. We expect children to return to in-person schooling and more employees to start returning to in-office work in the fall. So while we expect continued strong demand for our products, we also expect COVID-19-related volume benefits to start to slow at the end of our first quarter.","Organic net

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Additionally, we have good acceptance from customers on our pricing actions so far, but we expect the majority of our pricing to start hitting the market at the end of Q1. We expect the timing of the scale-up to benefit the second half. We also expect our second-half operating margins to be better than the first half.

CAG,2021,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Q1 is expected to have the highest inflation rate of the year and benefit the least from pricing. At the same time, we have planned strong investments behind A&P and innovation for the first quarter. As the year progresses, we expect margins to improve as the inflation rate decelerates and the impacts of our margin lever actions take hold.

As some of you remember, when we sold our private label business in 2016, we incurred a tax capital loss of approximately $4 billion that we could apply as a carryforward to offset capital gains generated through fiscal year-end '21.

We also utilized a portion of the asset in connection with the Q4 fiscal '21 restructuring of our ownership in Ardent Mills. And before year end, when the carryforward expired, we took additional actions that we believe should allow us to utilize a portion of the remaining capital loss carryforward in future periods.

CAG,2021,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As the table on Slide 8 shows our organic net sales growth of 9.7% exceeded our expectations in the quarter, despite the winter storm in February causing a small temporary disruption in the supply chain. We also delivered adjusted operating margin of 16% and adjusted EPS of $0.59, both in line with our quarterly guidance. This strong performance was driven by our continued execution of the Conagra Way playbook.

Once we have the product right, we need to make sure that consumers and customers have access to it across all channels. As we will detail today, this is exemplified by our investments in transportation to ensure physical availability amid elevated demand.

Our playbook is not just a slogan. It's the framework we use to run the business, and it continues to deliver great results. During the third quarter, we grew retail sales 13.8%, with each of our domains, frozen, staples, and snacks, outpacing the industry.","Investments in E-commerce, Digital Marketing, Brand Growth, Retail Sales Growth, Industry

CAG,2021,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As a result, we grew share in each of our domains. Our strong broad-based growth and share gains were fueled by both our superior penetration and repeat purchase rates in the quarter. Slide 11 shows that our household penetration rate during the third quarter was on average double that of our top 15 peers, and we outpaced those same peers in terms of repeat purchase rate. As I mentioned a minute ago, the Conagra Way playbook starts with building superior products.","Growth,

CAG,2021,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"When we began this journey over five years ago, we recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio, but it had to be modernized, so we set out to aggressively do just that. And you'll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales come from products launched within the preceding three years. As you can see on Slide 12, our innovation performance has consistently exceeded our 15% goal over the last two fiscal years and through the last 52 weeks, and our fiscal '21 innovation is performing even better than prior-year innovation. Compared to last year's launches, the products we introduced through the third quarter this fiscal '21 have achieved 66% more sales per UPC and 53% more distribution points per UC than during the comparable time period last year.","Innovation

Conagra has outpaced total edible retail sales in e-commerce growth each quarter throughout the pandemic, and we have grown share in e-commerce across 76% of our brands over the past year. As we've discussed before, we believe that e-commerce investment is a high-ROI opportunity to deliver our message to consumers.

CAG,2021,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"E-commerce shoppers over-index to younger millennial consumers. When consumers start to shop online, they're likely to continue the behavior and become heavy users of a brand, and online shoppers, in general, have higher brand loyalty than those shopping in-store. All of this demonstrates the opportunity for superior lifetime value that's being generated by our e-commerce investment and growth.

CAG,2021,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 12% on both a one- and two-year basis in the quarter, which is an acceleration from the second quarter. And Slide 18 demonstrates our growth in frozen accelerated on a sequential basis across many of our leading brands and categories. Our snacks business also continued to deliver strong growth throughout the third quarter. As you can see on Slide 19, we generated double-digit retail sales growth on a year-over-year and two-year basis in snacking, led by impressive increases across popcorn, sweet treats, and meat snacks.","Frozen Retail

Overall, I'm very pleased with our end market performance across the portfolio this quarter. And it's even more impressive, given the fact that we delivered these results despite continued supply constraints resulting from sustained elevated demand outpacing our ability to supply.

CAG,2021,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we try to understand where consumer trends are going, it's always helpful to look back at lessons from recent history. During the '08/'09 recession, we saw consumers shift from primarily consuming meals sourced away from home to meal sourced in home. While this shift is not surprising during the heart of a recession, it's important to recognize that the change in behavior, although event-driven, lasted well past the recovery. And we believe that a good portion of that change in behavior was driven by the formation of new habits.","Consumer

So while people are starting to leave their homes more frequently, they are still choosing to eat at home. Consumers are largely maintaining the habits they've acquired over the past 400 days, just like psychology predicts.

We've seen a market uptick in audience interaction, including direct engagement and advocacy from the person that created Dogecoin, as you can see on this slide.

So to summarize, we continued to deliver solid execution during the third quarter, and our business remains strong in the absolute and relative to peers.

As we have detailed this morning, the business continued to perform very well throughout the third quarter.

A favorable price/mix impact contributed a 3.6% increase to organic sales growth. As Sean mentioned, our organic sales growth was impacted a bit from the February winter storms that impacted our ability to deliver product for a short time during the quarter.

And finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable to our operating margin by 30 basis points versus a year ago as net sales grew at a faster pace than SG&A. I'd now like to touch on certain transportation investments we made in the quarter. These are incremental transportation costs incurred on top of the core transportation inflation we experienced, so we've included these in our COVID-19-related costs in the margin bridge.","E-commerce

As you can see by Q3 organic net sales exceeding guidance, demand was higher than we expected during the quarter. To adequately service this demand, we made the decision to invest approximately $15 million in the quarter. This meant aggressively seeking out every available truck and adjusting how we ship to customers.","Demand,

CAG,2021,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"To best service demand for certain brands, we had to bypass our normal distribution network and ship directly to customers. While we incurred additional costs to implement these actions, which impacted our operating margin, this enabled us to minimize out of stocks, maximize on-shelf availability and maximize profit dollars. COVID has provided a period of significant elevated consumer trial of our brands, and our innovation has outperformed expectations, allowing us to gain share with existing and new consumers. Investing to keep product on shelves to support this momentum and to support our retail customers while they manage tighter inventory levels was an easy business decision for us.","Demand,

CAG,2021,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"While we expect demand to remain elevated for the foreseeable future, we believe we will be in a position to start rebuilding inventory over the next two quarters, which we believe will start removing the need for these incremental investments. I want to take a moment to comment on the input cost inflation we're seeing in the market and provide an overview of what we're doing to navigate it. As you can see on Slide 42, inflation increased 3.9% in the third quarter.

CAG,2021,3,Dave Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"We expect the rate of inflation to continue to accelerate over the next few quarters. Fortunately, we have a variety of levers that can be used to offset this pressure, including pricing. We have already mobilized our inflation-justified pricing plans with some actions already in market, others communicated to customers, and some yet to come.

Slide 44 summarizes the drivers of our third-quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. In the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 increased by 25.5% compared to the same period a year ago.

We expect fourth-quarter operating margin to be in the range of 14% to 15%. This estimate includes the combination of continued transportation investments to support product availability at similar levels to Q3, the lag in timing between our pricing actions, and the expected acceleration of inflation, as well as a continuation of the A&P investment increase that started in Q2.

When we began this journey over five years ago, we've recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio, it just had to be modernized. So, we set out to aggressively do just that.","E-commerce Growth, New Innovation, Portfolio Modernization, Performance, Journey",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And you'll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales come from products launched within the preceding three years. As you can see on Slide 10, our innovation performance has continued to exceed our 15% goal. What's equally important is the consistency of our innovation performance. Investments we've made over the last five years in our innovation capabilities enabled us to continue launching new products since the pandemic began.","Innovation Performance, Retail Sales, Goal Achievement, Consistency, Investments",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Customers trust our innovation track record and rely on our new products to drive consumer trial and overall category growth.

CAG,2021,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Turning now to Slide 12, total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 8.3% versus a year ago thanks to strong growth in each of our four main frozen categories. Importantly, our terrific frozen vegetables business returned to strong growth in the quarter as we brought on our additional capacity investments online.

Recall that Birdseye previously faced some supply constraints as we worked to bring new capacity online.

Continuing to Slide 14, you can see how Birdseye has attracted and retained more new buyers than our competition since the pandemic began. Frozen vegetables category remains highly relevant to consumers and we believe the steps we've taken over the past several quarters to modernize the Birdseye brand and expand capacity have positioned us well to build on our category leadership.

CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk through the details of our second-quarter fiscal '21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. I'll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the quarter which were captured on Slide 22.","Performance Highlights, Q3 Outlook, Slide 22, Q&A",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"As Sean mentioned, outstanding execution by our teams across the company enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, margin, profitability, and deleveraging during the second quarter while we continued to invest in the business. Reported and organic net sales for the quarter were up 6.2% and 8.1%, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. We continued our strong margin performance from Q1 as Q2 adjusted gross margin increased 139 basis points to 29.9%. Adjusted operating margins increased 250 basis points to 19.6%.","Net Sales, Margin, Profitability, Deleveraging, Investment",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.7% to $712 million in the quarter. And our adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.6% to $0.81 for the second quarter. Slide 23 breaks out the drivers of our 6.2% second-quarter net sales growth. As you can see, the 8.1% increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by a 6.6% increase in volume related to the growth of at-home food consumption.","Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Net Sales Growth, Volume Growth, At-home
Food Consumption",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,The favorable impact of price mix which was evenly driven by favorable sales mix and less trade merchandising also contributed to our growth. The strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impacts of foreign exchange and a 1.7% net decrease associated with divestitures. The Peter Pan peanut butter business is still part of Conagra Brands and thus included in our organic results. We expect the sale of Peter Pan to be completed in Q3 at which point it will be removed from organic net sales growth.,"Price Mix, Sales Mix, Foreign Exchange, Divestitures, Peter Pan Peanut Butter",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"I will discuss the estimated impact of this divestiture shortly. Slide 24 summarizes our net sales by segment for the second quarter. On both the reported and organic basis, we saw continued significant growth in each of our three retail segments: grocery and snacks, refrigerated and frozen, and international. The net sales increase was primarily driven by the increase of at-home food consumption as a result of COVID-19, which benefited our retail segments but negatively impacted our food service segment.","Net Sales Growth, Segment Performance, At-home Food Consumption, COVID-19 Impact,

CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,The grocery and snack segment experienced strong organic net sales growth of 15.3% in the quarter. The segments we're getting net sales growth outpaced its growth in consumption as retailers continued to rebuild inventories. Our refrigerated and frozen segment delivered organic net sales growth of 7.8%. This growth is a testament to our continued modernization and innovation efforts and illustrates the increasingly important role refrigerated and frozen products play in meeting the evolving needs of today's consumers.,"Grocery and Snacks, Refrigerated and Frozen, Consumption, Innovation,

CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to the international segment. Quarterly organic net sales increased 9.1%. This segment experienced particularly strong growth in both Canada and Mexico. This quarter, our food service segment reported a 21.4% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by a volume decrease of 25.3% due to less restaurant traffic as a result of COVID-19.","International Segment, Food Service Segment, COVID-19 Impact, Volume Decrease, Net
Sales Growth",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 25 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the quarter versus the prior-year period. As you can see, in the second quarter, our adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Strong supply chain realized productivity, favorable price mix, cost synergies associated with Pinnacle Foods acquisition, and fixed cost leverage combined to drive 440 basis points in adjusted operating margin improvement more than offsetting the impact of cost of goods sold inflation and COVID-related costs in the quarter. Collectively, these drivers resulted in a 139 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin versus the same period a year ago.","Adjusted Operating Margin, Price Mix, Cost Synergies, COVID-related Costs,

CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"A&P increased 4.7% on a dollar basis primarily due to increases in e-commerce marketing A&P was flat on a percentage-of-sales basis this quarter versus Q2 a year ago. Finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable by 110 basis points primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales, the Pinnacle cost synergies, and temporarily reduced spending as employees work from home and significantly reduce their travel. I want to give you some additional perspective on our margin expansion. As I just mentioned, operating margin expanded 250 basis points for the quarter well ahead of our expectations.","A&P Growth, SG&A Rate, Margin Expansion, E-commerce Marketing, Cost Synergies",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Of this 250 basis point expansion in operating margin this quarter, approximately 60 basis points reflects our ongoing progress toward achieving our fiscal '22 margin target of 18% to 19%. We also saw an approximate 180 basis point margin benefit from price mix in the quarter primarily driven by mix, and to a lesser extent, favorable pricing in lower-trade merchandising. We expect to retain some of this benefit going forward, but exactly how much remains uncertain at this point. Additional 10 basis points of net margin expansion came from favorable fixed cost leverage across the entire P&L and COVID-related SG&A benefits, mostly offset by COVID-related cost of goods sold.","Margin Expansion, Price Mix, Fixed Cost Leverage, COVID-related Benefits, COVID-
related Costs",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We do not expect this net benefit to repeat next year. Slide 26 summarizes our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the second quarter. Our three retail segments, all operating profits increased by double-digit percentages versus the same period a year ago. Each retail segment benefited from higher organic net sales and strong supply chain-realized productivity.","Retail Segments, Operating Profits, Organic Net Sales, Supply Chain Productivity,
Slide 26",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"In the foodservice segment, however, operating profit decreased due to the COVID-related impacts of lower organic net sales and higher input costs that more than offset the impacts of favorable supply chain-realized productivity and cost synergies. Overall, we're pleased with the continuation of the strong Q1 margin results into the second quarter which are anchored by core productivity and benefits from the Pinnacle acquisition we expected to see.

Productivity, Cost Synergies",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"EPS increased 28.6% to $0.81. The growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion, and also benefited from a decrease in net interest expense as we've continued to reduce debt as prioritized. Slide 28 highlights our significant progress on the overall synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal '19. We captured an incremental $27 million in savings during the most recent quarter bringing total cumulative synergies to $246 million.","EPS Growth, Adjusted Operating Profit, Net Sales Increase, Margin Expansion,

Cost-of-goods-sold synergies have started to be a bigger portion of our synergy cash for the last two quarters and we expect them to make up a majority of our synergies going forward.

We are pleased to report that at the end of the second quarter, we achieved our net leverage ratio target of 3.6 times, down from five times at the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition and 3.7 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21.

Slide 30 summarizes our outlook. As Sean and I have both said throughout this presentation, we believe in the strength of Conagra's future.

CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We expect a continuation of elevated retail demand and reduced foodservice demand compared to historic pre-COVID-19 demand levels. We are currently seeing both of these trends continue in the third quarter to date. For the third quarter, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of plus 6% to 8%. We expect Q3 operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%, implying a year-over-year increase of 30 to 80 basis points.","Elevated Retail Demand, Reduced Foodservice Demand, Organic Net Sales Growth, Q3

CAG,2021,2,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"This estimate includes an expected acceleration of our AMC investment in e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2, reducing the estimated year-over-year Q3 operating margin expansion. As a reminder, Q3 operating margins are historically lower than Q2 operating margins given the leverage impact on the seasonality of sales. Given these sales and margin factors along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third-quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.60.

CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Our portfolio is well developed in the eating occasions that have seen the most significant and sustained shift to at-home eating, and our portfolio delivers against the cooking behaviors that consumers are adopting. We're attracting more new buyers than our peers, and consumers are choosing to stick with Conagra and come back for more. With our proven track record of innovation, we believe we will continue to attract new consumers and deliver food that meets their evolving needs. Let's drill down on some of the proof points that underpin these expectations, starting with why we believe at-home eating will remain elevated.","Elevated at-home

CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"since 2007. As you can see, the '08 recession was a catalyst for a 200-basis-point increase in at-home eating occasions, from 80% to 82% over the course of four years. Importantly, that rate held steady long after the recession ended, even when the economy returned to growth and employment hit record levels. With the COVID-19 disruption, we've already seen another 200-basis-point increase to 84% in the four months from March to June 2020.","Recession impact,
Eating habits, Basis points, Employment, Economic growth",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"History as a guide, the increased percentage of at-home eating occasions should persist even when economic growth returns. And as Slide 21 shows, as consumers are saving money in their food budgets, they are using their dollars and time differently. They're preparing to be at home for an extended period of time. Consumers are investing in their houses, their home gyms, their entertainment systems and their kitchens.","Consumer behavior,
Savings, Food budgets, Home preparation, Investments",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In the chart on the right, you can see that consumers are also spending more time cooking. Data is showing that consumers are tackling more complex mediums. In other words, they're upgrading their culinary skills. We don't expect these upgrades to homes, at-home entertainment, kitchens and cooking skills to go away anytime soon.","Consumer behavior,
Cooking skills, Home upgrades, At-home entertainment, Kitchen improvements",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"This all leads to one conclusion: more time at home, and, as a result, more consumption of food at home. The pivot to remote work is also a meaningful development. The significant workplace disruption we've experienced over the past several months has given way to a new normal remote workforce. The chart on the left of Slide 22 shows how even baseline projections see office vacancies remaining elevated over the coming years.","More time at home, Consumption of food at home, Remote work, Office vacancies, Baseline

CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Furthermore, on the right, we can see how remote workforce adoption has significantly increased. More working from home means more lunch is eaten at home and real opportunity for a portfolio like ours. And while we're well past the initial spike of stock-up behavior when COVID first emerged in the U.S. in March, at-home eating occasions have remained elevated, even increasing over the most recent two weeks of data.","Remote workforce

CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As the chart on Slide 23 shows, we're continuing to see a double-digit percent increase in total industry sales at retail versus the prior year. During our first quarter, food and beverage industry sales rose an impressive 14%. While we don't know exactly how these growth rates will trend going forward, we do know that we're entering the cold and flu season and that winter weather could limit the appeal of outdoor restaurant dining in many parts of the country. All of these factors give us reason to believe that the elevated levels of at-home eating should persist.","Industry sales, Total industry sales, Food and beverage industry sales, Cold and flu

CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,We also believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit. Let's start with Slide 24. Total at-home meals have increased almost 6% in the three months ending July 2020. That's almost seven billion meals.,"Total at-home meals, Increase in at-home meals, Benefit of Conagra, Slide 24, July 2020",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"When you take a closer look at this growth by daypart, the increases in meals and dollars are skewing toward lunch and dinner. And as you know, Conagra is well-developed in both of these dayparts. The chart on the right shows that, in fact, our portfolio overindexes in dinner and is almost at parity for lunch compared to the overall mix. And whether a consumer wants to cook from scratch to put those newly developed culinary skills to the test, or heat, and eat, Conagra's diverse portfolio can deliver a solution for every need in every daypart.","Lunch, Dinner,

CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So we are very well-positioned for when and how people are eating more at home. On Slide 25, you can see the benefits.

CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"This is further demonstrated by Slide 26, which shows we're attracting new buyers at a faster rate than any of our peers. Slide 27 shows that the buyers we're attracting overindexed to the coveted millennial and Gen X generations. As you might expect, we're seeing substantial millennial expansion in frozen, but, just as importantly, we're seeing their expansion in snacks and staples as well. Because of this, we're creating the groundwork for future growth above the category and above our peers.","Attracting new

CAG,2021,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We're attracting younger generations and building superior consumer lifetime value.

So in summary, executing our disciplined Conagra Way playbook over the last five years has grown our portfolio, grown our capabilities and positioned us to meet the evolving needs of our consumers while earning the confidence of our customers. We believe that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time as consumers seek affordable and convenient meals that meet the needs of their new normal, and we are confident that Conagra is well-positioned to see sustained benefit.

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our first-quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for questions. Let's look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, we started fiscal '21 on a strong note.","Financial
performance, First-quarter results, Outlook, Slide 33, Questions",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Elevated demand across our retail segments, coupled with effective execution, enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, profitability, free cash flow, and deleveraging. Compared to the same period a year ago, net sales and organic net sales for the first quarter were up 12.1% and 15%, respectively. Adjusted gross margin increased 244 basis points to 30.7%. Adjusted operating margin increased 450 basis points versus the same period a year ago, reaching 20.2% for the quarter.","Elevated demand, Net

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Adjusted EBITDA increased 34.5% to $647 million, and adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70, exceeding our first-quarter guidance. Slide 34 outlines the drivers of our first-quarter net sales versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the 15% increase in organic net sales was driven by a double-digit increase in volume, as well as favorable impacts from price/mix. Favorable pricing and sales mix both contributed to the growth in the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EPS, Net sales, Organic net sales, Price/mix",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Price/mix also included a benefit of approximately 70 basis points from a favorable change in estimate associated with a prior-period trade expense accrual. The organic net sales increase more than offset headwinds from divestitures and foreign exchange. As we pointed out in the past, the impact from divestitures continues to diminish sequentially as we anniversary the divestiture closing dates. Including the impact of the recently announced divestiture of HK Anderson, the full-year impact of divestitures is expected to approximate 100 basis points.","Price/mix, Organic

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,Turning to Slide 35. You'll find a summary of net sales by segment for the first quarter. We saw continued strong growth in each of the company's three retail segments on both a reported and organic basis. The net sales increase was primarily driven by consumers increasing their at-home food consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which benefited our three retail segments but negatively impacted the foodservice segment.,"Net sales, Retail
segments, COVID-19 pandemic, Foodservice segment",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"In the quarter, our grocery & snacks segment reported organic net sales growth of 20.7%. This segment benefited as consumers continue to purchase convenient, shelf-stable products to enhance their at-home eating experience. Segment growth in shipments this quarter exceeded growth in consumption as retailers began rebuilding inventories on brands, such as Hunt's, PAM, Duncan Hines, and Vlasic. The refrigerated & frozen segment also experienced strong growth in the quarter.","Grocery & snacks

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The 19% increase in organic net sales is a testament to our innovation and modernization efforts and the role our portfolio plays in meeting the needs of today's consumers. This segment also experienced shipment growth greater than consumption growth in the quarter, primarily as a result of Birds Eye. As Sean mentioned, we increased capacity in frozen vegetables during the quarter, enabling retailers to start replenishing their inventories. The international segment's 13.1% organic net sales growth came in stronger than we forecasted with each of the segment's regions posting growth higher than projected, primarily from COVID-related demand.","Innovation and
modernization efforts, Portfolio, Shipment growth, Capacity increase, International segment",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Our foodservice segment reported a 20.3% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by a volume decrease of 24.2% due to lower restaurant traffic. This marks an improvement from last quarter as some restaurant traffic began to rebound. Slide 36 outlines the drivers of the 450 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the first quarter. Our margin levers, such as realized productivity, price/mix, operating leverage, and synergies, drove a 610-basis-point increase in the quarter.","Organic net sales

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The specific drivers of this increase are: supply chain realized productivity of 290 basis points, price/mix of 250 basis points, cost of goods sold synergy of 90 basis points, and operating leverage of 60 basis points. Also, the net impact of divestitures, FX, and other items negatively impacted operating margin by 80 basis points. Cost of goods sold inflation was approximately 3.1% in the quarter, which negatively impacted gross margin by 220 basis points. We incurred approximately $34 million in cost of goods sold directly related to our COVID-19 response which negatively impacted gross margin by 150 basis points.","Supply chain realized

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Our A&P rate was favorable by 20 basis points in the quarter due to the favorable sales leverage. As on a dollar basis, we spent approximately the same amount as last year's first quarter. Finally, our SG&A rate was favorable by 190 basis points. Approximately 160 basis points was related to the combination of fixed-cost leverage on higher net sales and reduced spending related to COVID-19 as employees worked from home and did not travel.","A&P rate, SG&A rate,
Sales leverage, Fixed-cost leverage, COVID-19 impact",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The remaining 30-basis-point improvement was driven by synergies, partially offset by normal SG&A inflation and increases in stock-based compensation expense. We have certainly seen a margin benefit driven by the current environment, but it's also clear to see that we have made great progress improving the underlying operating margin of the business. Slide 37 shows our adjusted operating profit and margin summary by segment in the first quarter.

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Importantly, all four of our segments reported margin expansion in the quarter. These results demonstrate the tremendous operating margin improvement in our domestic retail and international segments. While the foodservice segment saw a decline in operating profit dollars, the segment reported a 28-basis-point increase in adjusted operating margin. This was aided by lower inventory write-offs and less trade spending in the quarter.","Margin expansion,

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 38 highlights that our adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70 in the quarter, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion. Turning to Slide 39. You will see a summary of our synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition in fiscal '19. After exceeding our fiscal '20 goal of $180 million, we have continued our strong synergy progress in the beginning of fiscal '21.","Adjusted EPS, Net

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"In Q1, we captured an incremental $35 million in savings, bringing total cumulative synergies through the end of the first quarter to $219 million. To date, the majority of our synergies have been in SG&A, and we expect the majority of the remaining synergies to be reflected in cost of goods sold.

As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.7 times, down from four times at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Given our income, we are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6 times by the third quarter of fiscal '21.

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Also, our cash flow remains very strong. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operating activities increased $78 million or 37% compared to the prior year. At the same time, we increased our investment in the business by increasing capex by $39 million or 36%.

activities, Capex, Supply chain investments, Brand growth",Conagra Brands
CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"This has led to our free cash flow increasing $39 million, 38% to last year's first quarter. As a result of our strong cash flows and progress reducing debt, we have greater financial flexibility to both invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. This, coupled with consistent successful execution of our strategic priorities and our ongoing confidence in the long-term strength of the business, led our board to approve a 29% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share or $1.10 per share on an annualized basis.

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"As we return cash to shareholders, we are also increasing our investments in the business, as evidenced by the 36% increase in Q1 capex I just mentioned.

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"However, the dynamics surrounding COVID-19 continue to make forecasting with specificity a challenge. What we can share is that we anticipate a continuation of elevated retail demand throughout the second quarter. We are, therefore, providing second-quarter guidance, as noted in the release and on this slide. We expect organic net sales growth of plus 6% to plus 8% in the second quarter.","COVID-19 dynamics,

CAG,2021,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We expect adjusted operating margin in the second quarter to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. Relative to Q1 operating margin, we expect less operating leverage benefit, and we expect to increase our marketing support, both above the line and below the line. We believe there are opportunities to increase brand-building investments where capacity permits. Given these operating margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver second-quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.70 to $0.74.","Adjusted operating

Of course, our ability to achieve these targets assumes continued performance end to end by our supply chain. Finally, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal '22 targets this morning.

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Over the past five years, we have been purposefully architecting one of the largest transformations in the food industry.

At this point, the degree to which demand will return to historical norms is still uncertain and the timing of the changes in consumer demand is also uncertain. However, we believe that demand will likely remain elevated in the near term given both consumer perceptions about returning to work and eating outside the home as well as the fact that consumers are discovering and rediscovering the pleasures, conveniences and tremendous value proposition of dining at home.","Portfolio response, consumer demand, COVID-19 impact, near-term outlook, cultural

Here at Conagra, we talk about infusing a refuse to lose attitude, and never before have we seen our team make such extraordinary efforts. The team's commitment has enabled us to meet the elevated demand from our customers and the communities we serve and deliver the strong results that we are announcing today.

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"During the fourth quarter, we experienced significant growth across our core operating metrics, including 21.5% growth in organic net sales and a 108.3% growth in adjusted EPS. These results helped to contribute to our rapid progress in reducing our leverage, and I'm proud to say that we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 4.0 times, down from 4.8 times in the third quarter. As you can see on slide 9, our growth was not confined to one area, but was driven by strong retail sales across our portfolio, spanning staples, frozen and snacks. Our strong growth in e-commerce continued to accelerate both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we've done over the past several years to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly paid off.

Our absolute sales on new innovation introduced this year increased 43% compared to our innovation slate of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, we stated at our initial Investor Day that our goal was to have 15% of total sales coming from products launched within the past three years.

For the fourth quarter, total Conagra frozen retail sales grew 26.2% over last year, with strong growth across each frozen category, including single serve meals, vegetables, multi-serve meals and plant based meat alternatives. And as slide 13 shows, as we grew we also gained share in the important frozen meals category during the quarter, continuing a trend we've seen for some time now. The Conagra Way playbook continues to pay off.","Frozen retail sales growth, category growth, share gain, frozen meals category, Conagra

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And while the trends have remained strong, there's even more opportunity, particularly in frozen vegetables. Birds Eye faced some unique dynamics in the quarter. As I said earlier, the category remained extremely relevant for consumers. We continue to see robust demand for frozen vegetables, and our retail sales up 26.5% during the quarter. Importantly, Birds Eye holds the top position in category share and has 2 times the share of the next branded player. Given the incredible surge in demand we experienced during the fourth quarter and our number one brand position, we hit a ceiling on capacity.","Birds Eye sales growth, frozen vegetable demand, category relevance, brand share,

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Furthermore, we made the decision to temporarily close a plant during the quarter due to COVID-19 which further constrained capacity. The good news is, the plant is safely back up and running flat out. In addition, we have made the strategic decision to bring on more external partners to fulfill demand and rebuild inventory. These investments in our supply chain will allow us to efficiently meet the elevated demand we are seeing today and expect to see going forward.

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Turning to snacks. Recall that our snacks business over-indexes to convenience stores which saw softer traffic due to COVID-19 during our Q4. Also, the seeds category was impacted by the postponement, and in many areas of the country cancellation, of baseball and softball seasons. Baseball and seeds go hand in hand, and the loss of these opportunities had a negative impact on the category. Even despite these discrete headwinds, the snacks business delivered a terrific 20.1% year-over-year growth and a 26.4% growth on a two year basis.","Snacks business growth, convenience store traffic, seeds category impact, baseball and

Our total staples business grew an incredible 46.3% for the quarter. The six brands to the right are our largest staples brands, accounting for over 50% of our staples sales at retail pre COVID, and each experienced considerable growth in the quarter. These businesses are proving to be a distinct benefit to our portfolio.","Staples business growth, brand performance, category relevance, portfolio benefits, slide

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So while we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year, we are particularly excited about what the quarter has taught us about the opportunity that lies ahead as consumers have shifted their behaviors and eating habits.","Consumer behavior, eating habits, quarterly results, yearly performance, opportunity
ahead",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 18 shows some of the key ways in which we're seeing consumers' behavior shift in response to COVID-19. Many consumers are rediscovering the enjoyment associated with at home eating, whether it's making fun baked goods, cooking with the family or enjoying a movie night with some snacks. Numerous consumers are also discovering new things about food during this time. Many are learning how to truly cook for the first time or discovering they can recreate restaurant favorites at home. We believe that many of these activities have staying power and are likely to persist even after a post COVID world in whatever new normal we settle into. We also believe our broad and refreshed portfolio of innovative products is best suited to meet consumers' needs as they engage in these food behaviors.","Consumer behavior shift, at-home eating, rediscovering enjoyment, new food discoveries,

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And slide 19 shows the strong growth during the quarter across our iconic brands, demonstrating how well suited our portfolio is to meet these behaviors. Our ability to meet the changing consumer needs is balanced across our three domains. Slide 20 shows how household penetration grew during the quarter in staples, snacks and frozen.","Strong growth, iconic brands, portfolio suitability, changing consumer needs, household

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And, as we've been able to modernize and innovate our iconic brands we are attracting younger consumers. Slide 21 shows that new consumers to our brands over-index in the younger millennial and Gen X market segments. Driving new trial is always a key focus for us. The investments that we've made over the past five years in updating our food with bold on trend flavors and modern food attributes were promised on the belief that if we can get people to try our food, they will come back for more, and that is exactly what's happening.","Attracting younger consumers, new trial focus, investments in modernization, bold flavors
and food attributes, consumer repeat business",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 22 shows the continuously improving repeat rates from consumers who tried our foods for the first time in March when the pandemic really started to accelerate in the US. The improved repeat rates are broad based across many of our iconic brands. Importantly, when we attract new triers to our brands, they are coming back to purchase again more often than they did a year ago. It's worth noting that this trend holds true for the big three Pinnacle brands, validating our work over the last 12 months.","Repeat rates, consumer trial, brand repeat business, improved repeat rates, trend
validation",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And slide 24 shows we're not just seeing an increase in repeat buyers, but we're seeing an increase in the frequency at which they return. Customers are not just coming back for more; they're coming back time and time again. And [Technical Issues] to the strength of our trial and repeat results, on an absolute basis, we are outperforming our peers in terms of new trials.","Increase in repeat buyers, frequency of return, trial and repeat results, absolute
performance, technical issues",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Let's take frozen as an example. Slide 25 demonstrates how our Banquet, Healthy Choice and Marie Callender's brands are leading frozen single serve peers in new buyer acquisition. And, as slide 26 shows, these new frozen buyers are disproportionately coming from the millennial and Gen X market segments, similar to what we see in total Conagra trends. And like the total Conagra trends we discussed, not only are we attracting new buyers, but we're seeing higher repeat rates in our frozen segment than our peers. Similarly, despite the supply constraints we faced that I noted earlier, Birds Eye continued to lead its category in terms of both new consumers and repeat purchases compared to peers during the quarter.","Banquet, Healthy Choice, Marie Callender's, frozen single serve, millennial and Gen X

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"All of these trends have important implications for our value creation opportunity as we look ahead. We believe the dynamic environment in which we find ourselves provides a unique window of opportunity to maintain the current momentum such that we maximize our long-term value creation potential. To make that possible, we need to make investments focused on doing everything in our power to ensure the physical availability of our products.","Momentum, value creation opportunity, investments, product availability, long-term
potential",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Instead of choosing to simply accept the elevated demand as transitory and focus on maximizing near-term margins, we have chosen to bolster the long-term earnings potential of our Company. We plan to accomplish this through investing in the key areas you see on this slide which include increasing capacity, both internal and external; innovation; inventory; e-commerce; and safety. By investing behind today's elevated trial rates, we will build relationships with new consumers and maximize consumer conversion. The lifetime value of these consumers easily justifies these actions.","Investing, capacity increase, innovation, inventory, e-commerce, safety",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 31 shows some highlights of our fiscal '21 innovation slate. Some of these items began launching in Q4, and we will continue to roll out these new products throughout the year. Overall, we are confident that the investments we are making will produce strong ROIs. They will also maximize our long-term value creation and ultimately shareholder value.","Innovation slate, new product launches, ROIs, long-term value creation, shareholder

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Turning to our guidance on slide 32. We know that you would like as much information about our expectations for the year as possible. Given the very dynamic nature of the external environment, forecasting the full year right now is more difficult than normal. As of today, therefore, we're providing Q1 guidance. We hope that when we report Q1 results, we will be in a position to give you a further update on our outlook. While we don't expect the next few months to drive as much change as the past few, we expect to know a lot more by then.","Guidance, external environment, Q1 guidance, Q1 results, future outlook",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Dave is going to go into more depth regarding the guidance, so I'll just hit the highlights here. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect to deliver organic net sales growth of 10% to 13%, adjusted operating margin of 17% to 17.5%, adjusted EPS of $0.54 to $0.59.

CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,We are deeply saddened by the recent events we've seen unfold across our nation. It's heartbreaking and unacceptable that racism and racial injustices continue to exist around the world. Our goal at Conagra is to work together in a constructive manner where everyone has a voice and has the opportunity to be heard.,"Racism, racial injustices, Conagra, nation, voice",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"D&I is not only part of our value system at Conagra, it's a business imperative. We serve a wide cross section of the population, and therefore it makes clear sense our organization represents the consumers we serve. D&I has always been a focus for Conagra Brands. But like many others, we can and we'll up our game. We are working with an external diversity and inclusion consultancy to help us identify specific opportunities that will have the most impact. We're also hosting listening sessions with employees throughout the organization.","D&I, value system, business imperative, consumers, opportunities",Conagra Brands

CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Before I discuss the details of the quarter, I want to take a moment to wish you all well. I hope you and your families are continuing to stay healthy and safe.","wish, health, safety",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"I'll kick off this portion of the call by pointing out a few highlights for the quarter and the full fiscal year which are captured on slide 34. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance for Q4 and the fiscal year. As Sean discussed earlier, in the fourth quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented demand in our retail businesses, which more than offset the softer foodservice demand. This increased retail demand, combined with our strong execution, enabled us to exceed the most recent full year fiscal '20 guidance for total Company sales, profit and free cash flow metrics.","Q4, fiscal year, COVID-19, retail, foodservice",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The key takeaways for Q4 and fiscal '20 are: organic net sales increased 21.5% in the fourth quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Adjusted operating margin increased almost 400 basis points for the fourth quarter and over 100 basis points for the full year. Adjusted EPS more than doubled in the fourth quarter and grew 13% for the full year. And adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6% for the full year to just under $2.3 billion, helping to reduce the leverage ratio to 4.0 times at the end of fiscal '20.","Q4, fiscal year, organic net sales, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EPS",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Let's start with the net sales bridge on slide 35. As you can see, our 21.5% organic net sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by 21% volume growth, with price/mix contributing 0.5 percentage point. Divestitures were a 310 basis point headwind in the quarter. This headwind will diminish sequentially as we continue to anniversary the divestiture closing dates going forward. Foreign exchange was a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter, with the weakening of the Mexican peso representing about two-thirds of the headwind. This was a bit higher than we were expecting for Q4. Finally, the 53rd week added 810 basis points for the quarter, which was more of a net sales tailwind than we expected due to the elevated COVID related demand at the end of the quarter, taking total reported net sales growth to plus 25.8% for Q4 versus a year ago.","net sales bridge, organic net sales growth, volume growth, price/mix, divestitures",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to slide 36, you see our sales summary by segment. In the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, we saw strong growth across our three retail focused businesses. Our Grocery & Snacks segment reported very strong organic net sales growth of 40.4%. The grocery business proved to be a significant asset as consumers reengaged with convenient shelf-stable products to facilitate and enhance the at home eating experience.","retail focused, organic net sales growth, Grocery & Snacks, fiscal year",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,The Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued to perform very well in the quarter. The segment reported organic net sales growth in each quarter of this fiscal year and has now had positive organic net sales growth in 11 of the last 12 fiscal quarters. This consistency shows that our modernization efforts have been working and are sustainable.,"Refrigerated & Frozen, organic net sales growth, quarterly performance, modernization
efforts, consistency",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The International segment's 19.8% organic net sales growth was due to strong growth in Canada and better than expected growth in the Mexican and export businesses due to the pandemic. Foodservice reported an organic net sales decline of 31.5%, which was better than expected as many restaurants continued to serve customer consumers with curbside pickup, drive-through or partial capacity.","International, Canada, Mexico, foodservice, decline",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 37 outlines the progress we've made on our Q4 adjusted operating margin versus the prior year. Throughout the quarter, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and COGS synergies continued to be effective. We also benefited from value-driven operating leverage in the quarter, approximating 100 basis points. These tailwinds were partially offset by increased COVID related costs, dilution from significant Foodservice operating margin declines and a 170 basis point headwind from inflation, resulting in a net gross margin improvement of approximately 110 basis points.","Q4 adjusted operating margin, gross margin expansion, realized productivity, pricing,
mix, COGS synergies, value-driven operating leverage, COVID related costs, inflation",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Given the already increased demand for food at home, we chose to pull back a bit on A&P in the quarter. That, coupled with increased net sales, drove a 100 basis point improvement to operating margin. While adjusted SG&A expense increased 5.7% in Q4 versus a year ago, net sales grew much faster, resulting in a 180 basis point tailwind to operating margin.","t1, t2, t3, t4, t5",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to slide 38, you can see that our adjusted operating profit was $562 million in the quarter, an increase of 63.5%. Adjusted operating margin increased just below 400 basis points to 17.1%. This chart clearly summarizes the outstanding operating margin improvement during Q4 in our domestic retail and international segments. This was partially offset by our Foodservice segment, which had significantly lower operating profit due to the 32% organic net sales decline, unfavorable fixed cost leverage on that sales decline, higher inventory write-offs and higher input costs.","t1, t2, t3, t4, t5",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to slide 39, we've summarized the various drivers of adjusted diluted EPS in Q4 versus a year ago. As you can see, our adjusted EPS increased $0.39 in the quarter, representing growth of over 100% from the same quarter last year. While the increase in EPS is primarily driven by the increase in operating profit associated with the net sales and margin increases, we also had higher income from Ardent Mills as COVID related demand was a net benefit. We also estimate a $0.05 per share benefit from the 53rd week.","t1, t2, t3, t4, t5",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to slide 42. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in Q2 fiscal '19 through the end of the fourth quarter and fiscal '20, we've reduced net debt by nearly $2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we reduced gross debt by $271 million and net debt by $725 million, improving our leverage ratio to 4.0 times at the end of Q4, down from 4.8 times at the end of Q3.","t1, t2, t3, t4, t5",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,4,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"What's not shown on this slide but is important to note is that we improved the funded status of our pension plans during fiscal '20 by $80 million, with the total underfunded status declining to approximately $50 million. For context, the pension plans' underfunded status were approximately $565 million at the end of fiscal '17, a reduction of over $500 million. This significant improvement was driven by planned pension contributions, lump sum payments to participants and actual returns on plan assets exceeding expectations.","t1, t2, t3, t4, t5",Conagra Brands

CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Today, I'm going to address two main topics; our response to COVID-19 and its impact on our business as well as the underlying trends that we saw in the third quarter, which ended just before the impact of COVID-19 started.

We're incredibly proud of our teams who have been producing and delivering without disruption. While we all remain focused on executing through this rapidly evolving situation, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we've made significant progress against the operational objectives we established for fiscal 2020.","Supply

CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In many ways, our progress against these objectives is enhancing our ability to navigate this crisis.

I'm proud to say that through the third quarter, we remained squarely on track with all of these objectives.","Progress, Integration, Synergy capture, Consumption growth, Innovation",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And from a financial standpoint, the third quarter results are in line with the expectations we provided at CAGNY. As we previously described, industry softness, which started in December in foodservice and pivoted to retail in January put pressure on consumption trends in several of our key categories, which more than offset share gains.","Industry

CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As expected, consumption trends recovered in February, prior to COVID-19 impact.

At that time, there were very few reported cases in the U.S., and notably no widespread change in behavior.","Consumption trends, COVID-19 impact, Third quarter, Behavior, Recovery",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we all know, that has changed significantly in recent weeks. From the second week of our fiscal fourth quarter to-date, we've experienced the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 as consumers have stocked up on food and shifted rapidly to eating more at home.

CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We will provide more detail on the impact of COVID-19 in a moment, but first we would like to walk you through the highlights of the third quarter. During the third quarter, our performance was in line with the updated expectations that we provided at CAGNY. Organic net sales growth decreased 1.7% while our adjusted operating margin was 15.7% and our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.47 for the quarter.","Performance, COVID-19 impact, Organic net sales growth, Operating margin, EPS",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we noted at CAGNY, we saw category softness in January that was greater than anticipated. At the time we told you that our more recent data was improving and we expected to bounce back and that's exactly what happened.","Category

CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As you can see on Slide 7, Total Conagra retail sales returned to growth in the final four weeks of February and sustained a normal rate into the first week of Q4. Clearly, even before the current disruption due to COVID-19, we were well on track and had already seen the expected rebound in consumption trends. Not only did we see growth of 0.9% in the four weeks ended February 23rd but what we saw in the week ended March 1, which is in our fiscal fourth quarter, reaffirmed this return to consumption growth.","Consumption trends, Retail sales, Growth, COVID-19 disruption, Track",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And, during the quarter, we continued to deliver on integration, synergies, and deleveraging. On integration, we have been converting Legacy Pinnacle plants over to SAP. And through Q3, this multi-year process has been progressing on plan. We captured $33 million in incremental synergies, increasing our total through the end of Q3 to $145 million and we made further progress on reducing our net debt position by paying down $450 million of debt during the quarter.","Integration, Synergies, Deleveraging, Debt reduction, Progress",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 9 demonstrates our continued success in the important Frozen category. As both graphics demonstrate, we maintained strong growth during the quarter across our Frozen portfolio both for Total Conagra Brands and Legacy Conagra Brands.

CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Not only did we have yet another quarter of gaining share of shelf and share of sales, but we also did so at an accelerated rate. Our Snacks segment reported solid growth in the third quarter. Total Snacks were up 2.9% during the quarter and 8.7% on a two-year basis.

CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 15 shows a milestone for Conagra as we bend the trend on Legacy Pinnacle on both a one-year and a two-year basis. Recall that in December 2018, we outlined a number of actions that were needed to get Pinnacle back on track. We also indicated that we did not expect to see the impact of those actions until the second half of fiscal 2020, which as you can see here is exactly what has occurred.","Legacy

CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 16 shows how we've been able to bend the trend in the Big 3 Legacy Pinnacle brands by implementing the Conagra Way playbook. We started with Wish-Bone where the missteps came from several executional issues including a label change, which we quickly addressed to stabilize the brand. As a result, we saw an immediate spike in retail sales before returning to more normal levels.","Bending

CAG,2020,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Birds Eye, which is our biggest brand, took a little longer as the playbook required us to remove lower performing SKUs, which negatively impacted sales and distribution.

As a reminder, we've made significant investments to expand Gardein's manufacturing capacity, which came online earlier this fiscal year. As the slide shows, the brand's growth is attributed to more than just meatless burgers and includes meatless options for chicken, seafood and sausages, to name a few.

CAG,2020,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"I'll start my remarks this morning by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter, which are outlined on Slide 23. As Sean discussed, our Q3 performance was consistent with the expectations we've provided at CAGNY. This included broad-based category softness early in the quarter and a return to consumption growth in February prior to the COVID-19 related surge in demand.","Performance for the quarter, Category softness, Consumption growth, COVID-19

CAG,2020,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Moving to Slide 25, you can find our sales summary by segment. In the quarter, organic net sales for the Grocery & Snacks segment decreased 3.6%. The Snacks business continued to perform well.

Throughout the quarter, the segment continued to benefit from the growth in the Canadian Snacks business and Frozen businesses. Recall that earlier this year, we said that the business in India had a transitory headwind that would rebound in the second half and that is what we saw in Q3. These benefits were more than offset by economic challenges primarily in Mexico and certain planned value-over-volume actions.","International segment, Net sales, Organic net sales, Canadian Snacks business, Frozen business",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 8% in Q3 while organic net sales decreased 2.2% as divestiture subtracted 5.8%.

CAG,2020,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to Slide 26, you can see the adjusted operating bridge for the quarter versus the prior year. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, input cost inflation did start to increase in Q3. In the quarter, inflation was just over 3%, which translated into a 240 basis point headwind to margin.

Our adjusted operating profit decreased 8.9% in Q3 and our adjusted operating margin came in at 15.7%.

First, we ended the quarter with $99 million of cash on hand. We expect stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and because of the increased retail demand we're experiencing in light of COVID-19.

We delivered organic net sales growth of 1.6% during the quarter, which brings our year-to-date growth to 0.1%. As we've talked about previously, we expect fiscal 2020 to be back half weighted, based on the cadence of the actions we're taking, including our innovation launch schedule.

As you can see on slide 11, the execution of our playbook has allowed us to expand our adjusted operating margin by 21 basis points in the first half of this year, as compared to the same period last year.

In international, the second quarter brought continued strong performance in Canada as well as distribution gains in Mexico. In Foodservice, recall that in Q1, we made the strategic decision to opt out of a particularly low margin contract consistent with our value over volume strategy. This past quarter, we've seen strong sales as we predicted in our Snacks business as well as in the Gardein and Udi's brands. In addition, operating margins improved year-over-year.","International,

CAG,2020,2,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Overall, we see good progress through the first half of the year.

CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal '20 performance as well as the updates to our guidance. We'll then move to Q&A. As Sean noted, October 26, marked the first anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As a result, about one month of Legacy Pinnacle performance is included in our organic results for the second quarter, which ended on November 24, 2019. I'll start by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter, which you can find on slide 32.","Second Quarter
Performance, Fiscal '20 Guidance, Pinnacle Acquisition, Organic Results, Q&A",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Reported net sales for the second quarter were up 18.3% versus the same period a year ago, primarily reflecting the continued impact of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition. Organic net sales increased 1.6% driven by 1% volume growth and 0.6% price mix favorability. As Sean mentioned, every segment delivered organic net sales growth this quarter. For the second quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 14.1% to $804 million, primarily driven by the net impact of the addition of Pinnacle's gross profit as well as cost synergies.","Pinnacle Foods
Acquisition, Organic Net Sales Growth, Adjusted Gross Profit, Segment Performance, Cost Synergies",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Price mix and supply chain productivity also benefited the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by input cost inflation, increased brand-building investments with retailers and a reduction in profit from the divestitures of the Wesson oil, Gelit, and DSD snacks businesses over the last year. Adjusted SG&A came in at 9.2% of net sales for Q2 as we continue to recognize SG&A synergies from the Pinnacle acquisition. Adjusted net income increased 8.3%, as the improvement in operating profit and cost synergies more than offset the impact of higher interest expense associated with the Pinnacle transaction and the reduction of profit from recent divestitures.","Price Mix, Supply Chain

CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"It's also worth noting that adjusted EBITDA, which includes equity method investment earnings and pension and post-retirement non-service income increased 17.2% to $610 million in the quarter. As I'll describe in more detail in a moment, our adjusted diluted EPS decreased 6% to $0.63 for the quarter. Slide 33 outlines the drivers of second quarter net sales growth of 18.3% versus the same period a year ago. We delivered year-over-year volume growth for the quarter. And as you can see, we continue to drive an increase in price mix, despite the additional retailer investments to support brand building that we highlighted last quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA, Diluted

CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Total retailer investments reduced the net sales growth rate by 150 basis points, which was a bit favorable to our expectations. Our slotting related expense, which is closely tied to new innovation launches increased as planned. But we also deliver -- delivered better-than-expected efficiencies in other trade programs. The increase in net sales associated with acquisitions includes 61 days of Pinnacle before it entered the organic base, which added approximately 20% of net sales, and was offset by a 2.9% net sales decrease from the divestitures of the Wesson oil, Gelit and DSD snacks businesses.","Total Retailer

CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Moving to slide 34, you can see our sales summary by segment. As Sean discussed, we made very good progress across the portfolio and delivered organic net sales growth in all four segments during the second quarter. Grocery & Snacks' net sales increased 14.2% in Q2, with the acquisition of Pinnacle adding 16.9% and the divestiture of the Wesson oil and DSD snacks businesses subtracting 3.6%. Organic net sales for this segment increased 0.9%, reflecting continued strong end market performance, and innovation successes across many of our snacking brands.","Grocery & Snacks, Organic

CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to Refrigerated & Frozen, quarterly net sales and organic net sales for the segment increased 20 -- 28.8% and 2.4% respectively. Once again, this segment benefited from a robust slate of innovation across multiple brands including Birds Eye, Healthy Choice, Marie Callender's, and P.F. Chang's. Our International segment continued to benefit from growth in the Snacks and Frozen businesses in the second quarter. International net sales increased 7.3% primarily due to the acquisition of Pinnacle.","Refrigerated & Frozen,
Innovation, Segment Performance, Acquisitions, International",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Organic net sales increased 1.8% driven by an increase in volume. Net sales for the Foodservice segment increased 6.8% in Q2, with an organic net sales increase of 0.8%. The organic net sales increase was mostly driven by a 3.6% improvement in price mix, partially offset by volume declines of 2.8% as a result of the segment's continued execution of value over volume, which drove additional operating margin improvement.","Organic Net Sales Growth,

CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 35 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the quarter versus the prior year. Inflation in Q2 was roughly in line with our expectations. At the same time, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and synergies more than offset inflation in the quarter. We're just beginning to lap the anniversary of the steel inflation headwind we began to experience during the same period last year. But we do estimate increased inflation related to proteins moving forward. We continue to estimate full year fiscal '20 inflation of approximately 2.8%.","Inflation, Gross Margin

CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"With respect to A&P, we continue to focus on driving the right level of spend on the highest ROI opportunities. In this quarter, our working A&P, that is A&P investments that reached the consumer directly increased year-over-year. The overall decrease in A&P shown on slide 35 was driven by lower spending on non-working expenses, such as research costs, along with A&P synergies associated with the Pinnacle deal.","A&P Spend, ROI

CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 36 outlines our significant progress to-date on overall Pinnacle synergy capture. We realized $42 million of cost synergies this quarter, bringing total cost synergy realization $112 million from the close of the acquisition through the second quarter. Just to clarify, this $42 million is the incremental synergy benefit versus a year ago, as we captured $1 million of synergies in Q2 last year.","Pinnacle Synergy Capture,

As we dug in with the benefit of more information after the acquisition closing, we found additional synergy opportunities. Accordingly, at our Investor Day in April, we announced an increase to our total Pinnacle related cost synergy target to approximately $285 million through fiscal '22. From a cadence standpoint, we announced that 55% of that total or approximately $160 million was expected to come by the end of fiscal '20.","Synergy, Pinnacle,

Today, we are increasing our synergy capture expectation for fiscal '20 from approximately $160 million to approximately $180 million. And we are updating our total synergy target from approximately $285 million to approximately $305 million through fiscal '22. The $20 million of additional synergy is primarily driven by favorable SG&A, A&P and trade efficiency.

As you can see, our adjusted EPS of $0.63 decreased by $0.04 this quarter compared to the same period last year. The increase in adjusted operating profit and the benefit from Ardent Mills, were more than offset by increases in interest expense and shares outstanding.

CAG,2020,2,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 39 summarizes net debt and cash flow information. I'm pleased with the work being done across the organization to achieve our deleveraging and free cash flow targets. We have continued to make strong sequential improvements in reducing debt and improving the overall financial health of the business. We expect our deleveraging to accelerate in the second half of fiscal '20 due to the seasonality of our cash flows.

Fiscal 2020 is on track following a very solid Q1. We continue to implement the Conagra Way to profitable growth by executing against the principles and plans we shared at Investor Day. We're applying our value over volume playbook to the Legacy Pinnacle portfolio and we've made important progress strengthening the foundation of the business and repositioning Pinnacle's leadership brands for profitable growth. We're also pleased to report that our ongoing integration and synergy capture related to the Pinnacle business and our deleveraging progress remain squarely on track.","Fiscal 2020, First

Looking ahead, we remain confident that our second half results will reflect stronger growth than the first half. We'll lap the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition and the easier comps due to the start of our value over volume execution across its portfolio. We'll also begin to benefit from the exciting new innovations that are being introduced to the market. Therefore, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2020 guidance for all previously communicated metrics. Our agenda this morning is to provide an update on our work on the Legacy Pinnacle business, discuss our continued progress on Legacy Conagra and share some additional details on our expectations for the remainder of the year.","Legacy Conagra,

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Turning to the Legacy Pinnacle portfolio. Before diving into the details here, I'd like to take a step back and review the central tenets of our value over volume playbook, which is essentially our approach to optimizing the base business and establishing a stronger foundation on which to build. As you've heard me say before, value over volume is a disciplined approach to growth that acknowledges not all volume is created equal and consumer demands are always evolving.","Value Over Volume
Playbook, Legacy Pinnacle Portfolio, Central Tenets, Growth, Consumer Demands",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The approach dictates that we consistently apply rigor to portfolio management, value over volume involves eliminating weaker SKUs in advance of the launch of higher performing new products and the associated brand building investments. It also involves renovating the core and getting the fundamentals right. These fundamentals include pricing, promotion, assortment, distribution, product quality and packaging.","Portfolio
Management, Value Over Volume, Brand Building, Fundamentals, Pricing",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We previously shared that our application of value over volume to the Legacy Pinnacle portfolio would be a key priority. And as you can see on Slide 7, we're making real progress. In fact, we're seeing very similar patterns to what we saw in Legacy Conagra a few years ago. We've trimmed low-quality SKUs from the marketplace. We've seen TPDs decline near term, but importantly, we've also seen base velocities improve sharply. We demonstrated on brands like Banquet and Healthy Choice in Legacy Conagra this creates a much stronger foundation on which to infuse brand-building investments.","Value Over Volume,

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Wish-Bone is one of the key Legacy Pinnacle brands where we're furthest along in strengthening the foundation. As we've discussed previously, Wish-Bone was challenged by several issues; service, quality and the label change execution. We identified the issues and took action fixing the service challenges, improving labels for better and variety communication and also upgrading the product quality.","Wish-Bone, Legacy

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As you can see on Slide 8, we've stabilized the business. In fact, we grew it in Q1. We also remain highly focused on executing our playbook on the Birds Eye and Duncan Hines brands. Low performing SKUs have come out of the market and fundamentals are improving. Keep in mind that we're in the very early stages of recognizing the benefits from our new innovations in these categories. The shelf reset windows at large customers are different than they are for Wish-Bone. So the timing of their recoveries is different. We do anticipate improvement in the second half of fiscal 2020 for both of these brands as they begin to benefit from the addition of our new innovation slate. We're confident that the Birds Eye and Duncan Hines brands will continue to stabilize and are on track for profitable growth.","Stabilization,

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We also remain on track across all our integration, synergy and deleveraging initiatives as highlighted on Slide 10.

As we consistently said, we remain firmly committed to maintaining a solid investment grade credit rating. Overall, we had a solid first quarter on Legacy Pinnacle, we've made good progress in strengthening the foundation across the portfolio and look forward to continued improvement in the back half of the year as we begin to benefit from the new innovations.","Balance Sheet,

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Turning to Legacy Conagra. The business started the year well and we're pleased with the trends we're seeing. The Legacy Conagra business delivered solid performance during the quarter. Together, the two large domestic retail businesses outperformed their planned organic net sales growth. Yet again, we saw terrific momentum in our Legacy Conagra frozen and snacks businesses. As expected, our grocery sales performance in Q1 was impacted by some holdover from the Hunt's and Chef Boyardee dynamics that we detailed last quarter.","Legacy Conagra,

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we'll share with you today, we have action plans in place and trends are already improving. But we also experienced some unplanned softness in our International and Foodservice segments during the quarter and this negatively impacted our top line performance. This softness relates to some one-time issues and both segments are expected to recover in the second half. Importantly, despite these top line headwinds, our International and Foodservice segments over-delivered their profit plans for the quarter.","Action Plans,

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Let's get into each of these items in more detail. Turning to slide 13, you can see that total retail sales for the Legacy Conagra business were up 0.9% from the same period a year ago, demonstrating 2.7% growth over the two-year period. While I'll walk you through the year-on-year drivers of the fiscal year in a moment, you can see in this chart that the two-year growth rate has been fairly stable for the past four quarters and we're entering a period of easier comparisons on a one-year basis.","Total Retail

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"On slide 14, you can see that we continued our momentum in the Legacy Conagra frozen portfolio throughout the first quarter with retail sales growing 2.5%. In addition, our Legacy Conagra frozen meals business continued to outperform our peers in Q1. In fact, it has become the industry leader in the frozen category. Our Legacy Conagra meals business -- frozen meals business now has been in Number 1 position in share of total retail sales and gained share of category dollars in Q1.","Retail Sales
Growth, Frozen Portfolio, Industry Leader, Share of Total Retail Sales, Share of Category Dollars",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 16 demonstrates that we're also gaining share of shelf. As we discussed, in some instances, our actions to remove low-performing products drives lower TPDs as we create more holding power for our higher velocity items. In other cases, we've seen TPDs expand. In either event, our goal is to grow share of shelf and that's exactly what we're doing. As we know, our retail customers run the ultimate meritocracy. They will give more space to the products that move off the shelf the fastest. This data demonstrates that we're earning more shelf space by having products that consumers demand.","Gaining Share of
Shelf, Low-Performing Products, TPDs Expanding, Retail Customers, Meritocracy",Conagra Brands
CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Importantly, shelf space is a leading indicator that bodes well for our opportunity to grow sales. Frozen wasn't the only leader in our Legacy Conagra portfolio in Q1. Snacks also maintained momentum through the first quarter and delivered strong results across a variety of brands and categories. Total retail sales in snacks were up an impressive 7.2% versus a year ago. Meat snacks and seeds emerged as particularly strong leaders with an increase in retail sales of 9.4% and 8.5%, respectively. Overall retail dollar sales in snacks demonstrated sustained performance improvement throughout the first quarter, having grown 9.8% on a two-year basis.","Shelf Space,

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Similar to frozen, our Legacy Conagra snacks business is also outperforming its peers and gaining share as demonstrated on slide 18. Turning to the Legacy Conagra grocery portfolio for a moment, if you recall, last quarter we faced headwinds in our grocery portfolio related to pricing and promotional challenges. As the cost of steel cans increased, we implemented inflation justified pricing on Hunt's canned tomatoes and Chef Boyardee to partially offset the increased cost. However, our private label competition in canned tomatoes kept prices flat, and in some instances, actually decreased prices. And on Chef Boyardee, we lost some high-quality merchandizing. The effect of these dynamics was a higher-than-expected volume decline in Q4. We planned for this decline to continue through the first quarter as a carryover from Q4, and it did. We've already begun implementing action plans for each of these brands to reverse this trend.","Legacy Conagra

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"But before I get into the year-to-go, I'll cover Foodservice and International.

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The International segment was impacted by external events in Puerto Rico and India that shifted the timing of sales previously expected in Q1 to the second half. While this shift in timing impacts our quarter-to-quarter results, we expect that it will have no net impact on the top line for the fiscal year. Partially offsetting this timing shift, our International segment benefited from growth in snacks and frozen.

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In our Foodservice segment, we made the strategic decision this quarter to opt out of a particularly low-margin contract consistent with our value-over-volume strategy. While this decision negatively impacted our top line in the near term, it was the right thing to do for the health of the business and benefited our Q1 margins in the segment. Furthermore, we expect stronger top-line performance in Foodservice for the balance of the year with new items coming to market. We also expect better-than-anticipated performance from Gardein within the Foodservice segment, which will start to be included in our organic number during the second quarter.","Strategic

First, we are providing more promotional support on Hunt's and Chef Boyardee to better compete in markets. Second, we've got a strong investment plan for Q2 for the new innovation that's about to hit the market. In fact, the second quarter will mark the peak of our investment cycle as we incur launch expenses to tee-up our slate of new products.

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We'll see innovation build across many of our segments in the second half of the year. We expect our in-store presence to be much stronger and drive growth. In some categories, this will be on the back of increased TPDs and in others, it will come on the back of increased facings on high-velocity items. We will also benefit from easier comparisons in the back half of the year, as we lap prior-year value-over-volume activity and increased competition.

CAG,2020,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Let's go into each of these items in a bit more detail. Starting in the second quarter, we began launching new smart promotional support for Hunt's and Chef Boyardee to improve volume trends.

The first two weeks of our second quarter have shown the benefit of these strategic promotions.

I'll walk through more detail in a moment, but I'll start here by noting a few highlights. Compared to the same period a year ago, net sales for the first quarter were up 30.3%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. Organic net sales were down 1.7%. The decrease in organic net sales was primarily driven by the unplanned softness in International and Foodservice and the planned declines in our Grocery & Snacks segment that Sean discussed.","Net Sales Growth,

International organic net sales continued to benefit from growth in the snacks and frozen businesses in certain regions. However, the segment's organic net sales were down versus plan in prior year, due to discrete items in our businesses in Puerto Rico and India.

While we're confident in our long-term trajectory, and as fiscal 2019 overall positioned us well for the future, our financial results for Q4 did not meet our expectations. Our Q4 results were hampered by several unique items, each of which we will unpack for you today. Q4 organic net sales growth in the Legacy Conagra business missed our guidance by 240 basis points, which equates to about $43 million. The unexpected items that drove this shortfall included negative impacts of intensified promotional competition in our Hunt's, Chef Boyardee and Marie Callender's businesses. This drove about three-fourths of our sales miss this quarter. We view this as a transitory renting of market share that happens from time-to-time.

CAG,2019,4,Sean M. Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We also experienced some unexpected manufacturing and co-packer related challenges in the quarter. These issues were one-off in nature, and have been addressed.

CAG,2019,4,Sean M. Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Let's take a closer look at how this merchandising dynamic affected our Marie Callender's brand. Fiscal '19 was an important year for Marie Callender's, as we undertook significant changes to modernize the brand and improve profitability. These changes included adding modern attributes and flavor profiles with simplified higher quality ingredients, transitioning from trays to goals (ph), rightsizing portions and optimizing lower performing SKUs. As a result of these changes, the underlying brand health is far better and our new Marie Callender's items have significantly higher velocities than the meals they replaced.

CAG,2019,4,Sean M. Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 14 highlights, one example, where our competitor's product was discounted to drive significant incremental or promoted growth. As we move through the fourth quarter, our competition became more aggressive on price and displaced some of the very valuable merchandising support that we had anticipated from Marie Callender's. We don't believe that the short-term renting of our market share is a sustainable way to compete. We'll stay true to the Conagra Way playbook and our principled approach.

But we may from time to time, take short-term actions to protect our share as we look to continue to build for the long term. We also experienced some unanticipated effects of our disciplined approach to pricing in our Grocery portfolio. As you can see on slide 15, the cost of steel cans increased 14% year-over-year. As we took inflation justified pricing on Hunt's and Chef Boyardee to partially offset the increased cost, we experienced higher than expected volume declines.

CAG,2019,4,Sean M. Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Last quarter, we said that we saw a competition announcing price increases, and you can see that reflected in all other increase of 4.5%. But what we did not anticipate is that private label would stay flat, and in some instances actually decrease price. By the end of the quarter, price gaps were simply too wide for consumers to ignore, and we lost volume. Similarly, on Chef Boyardee, we took price increases throughout the year. In Q4, the elasticity impacts of these increases were exacerbated by a decrease in merchandising support that was beyond our expectations.

CAG,2019,4,Sean M. Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Finally, our Q4 EPS was also impacted by weakness in the Ardent Mills joint venture. Ardent Mills profit eroded during the quarter, lower than anticipated wheat prices and reduced volatility in the wheat markets negatively impacted Ardent's results. Q4 presented a variety of headwinds to navigate. Ultimately, our results did not meet our expectations. But we were not thrown off course. While we had our challenges, there were also clear signs of continued progress during the quarter. With respect to our Legacy Conagra business, Q4 saw a continuation of the strong performance in our Snacks business and positive results from frozen single-serve meals that we have talked about all year.

Let's turn to our Snacks business, which continues to exceed our expectations. Slide 22, details the growth we delivered in Q4, which included contributions from every key snacking vertical; popcorn, meat snacks, sweet treats, and seeds. Overall, retail dollars sales in our Legacy Conagra snacking portfolio grew 12.6% on a two year basis in the fourth quarter.

We believe we have a tremendous opportunity to contemporize our newly acquired leadership brands to capitalize on key growth pockets. One area of the Pinnacle portfolio, where we now see far greater growth in innovation opportunities than previously forecast is the Gardein brand.

CAG,2019,4,Sean M. Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We start by sizing the total opportunity. Based on our analysis of product substitution in other categories, almond milk for cow's milk as an example, we can reasonably predict the opportunity for plant-based meat alternatives. And here's where it gets really exciting, because the opportunity shouldn't be viewed as just a percentage of fresh meat. We think the opportunity is a percentage of all foods that contain meat. Based on this view, our analysis shows that plant-based meat alternatives could achieve a 15% share of both of these market segments. That means the opportunity here, could be in the range of $30 billion just in the US. And you know there's even more opportunity internationally. So the financials are compelling. I think many of you may be surprised by the numbers on slide 33, showing just how large the Gardein brand is already. It has quadrupled in size over the past four years, and is now the second largest brand in the meat alternative space with annual sales of more than $170 million at retail and across Foodservice channels.","Opportunity,

CAG,2019,4,Sean M.

These expanded resources are already well under way and we expect them to be operational in the fall of 2019. And we anticipate that capacity will be used to produce more than just burgers.

CAG,2019,4,Sean M. Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 36 focuses just on the plant-based meat alternative space within the retail channel. As you can see here, plant-based alternatives to beef are the largest protein alternative today, driven by the fact that products like veggie burgers have been available at retail for a long time. However, alternatives to chicken have built a substantial beachhead and this space is the fastest growing plant-based alternative by far.","Plant-

The brand already provides a diversified portfolio of products, particularly in the under-appreciated alternative to chicken segment.

Gardein's corn burger platform is under-developed, and we are in the process of creating the next generation of beefless burger to better compete in this popular segment.

CAG,2019,4,David S. Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 42 outlines our performance for the quarter and the full fiscal year. I'll walk through more detail in a moment, but I'll start here by hitting the key points. Compared to the year-ago period, net sales for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year were up 32.9% and 20.2% respectively, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. Organic net sales excluding Trenton were down 0.7% for the quarter. While the quarter did not come in as we expected, we believe the issues in the quarter are transitory as Sean discussed and do not impact our fiscal year '20 guidance or long-term algorithm. Despite the Q4 challenges, we delivered organic net sales growth of 0.3% for the fiscal year, which is above last year's organic growth rate.","Net

CAG,2019,4,David S. Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"Adjusted operating profit was up 25.7% in the fourth quarter, and up 23.4% for the full year. These increases are primarily driven by the inclusion of Pinnacle's profit. A few points on margins. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 13.2% and full-year was 15.4%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year and above our guidance range. While adjusted gross margin decreased for the full year, adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points. This relationship reflects the gross margin impact of our ongoing shift of marketing investments from A&P to above the line retail marketing. As well as leverage at the SG&A line, where we have benefited from our commitment to a lean operating environment and Pinnacle synergies.","Adjusted

Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.36 for the quarter, down 28% from the prior year.

CAG,2019,4,David S. Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"For the full fiscal year, Grocery & Snacks, Organic net sales remained largely in line with the prior year. The Refrigerated and Frozen segment continued to benefit from innovation during Q4 across multiple brands, including Banquet, Healthy Choice, Marie Callender's and Reddi-wip. However, these benefits were more than offset by lower than expected merchandising support on Marie Callender's, the P.F. Chang's manufacturing challenges that resulted in a recall and to a lesser extent continued declines in certain refrigerated businesses. These headwinds, led to a decrease in reported and organic net sales in Q4.","Grocery &

CAG,2019,4,David S. Marberger,Chief Financial Officer,"For the full year, however, the segment reported good growth with net sales and organic net sales up 1.9% and 0.9% respectively. As Sean mentioned, the implementation of our Conagra playbook led to improved results in International for the quarter and full year. The segment's fourth quarter reported numbers were impacted by the divestitures of the Canadian Del Monte business and Wesson oil business, which combined to reduce the net sales growth rate by approximately 10.2%.

For the quarter, the Foodservice segments reported and organic net sales were down 12.6% and 0.6% respectively. The sale of the Trenton facility and divestiture of the Wesson oil business reduced the net sales growth rate by 12% in the aggregate. The segment's Q4 organic net sales results reflect continued execution of our value over volume strategy and the impact of inflation justified pricing.

As Sean mentioned, we have seen these situations before and will remain agile in how we respond to competition. Consistent with what we've been saying since December, we continue to expect Legacy Pinnacle sales trends to improve in the second half of fiscal '20. We also expect margins to improve during the second half of fiscal '20 as the innovation related investment will be higher in the first half as I just mentioned.

There's a lot to cover this morning; we have strong Legacy Conagra results to discuss, a positive Pinnacle integration update to share, deleveraging to discuss, and a preview of our April 10th Investor Day. But the most important takeaway from everything Dave and I will discuss today is what these results mean, the Conagra Way to profitable growth delivers. The impact of our unwavering commitment to the Conagra Way over the past several years has been consistent progress, most recently resulting in the continued strong momentum in core Legacy Conagra Brands during the third quarter, particularly in our leading frozen and snacks businesses. We are now aggressively applying this approach to Pinnacle and it's working to keep the technical integration on track as well as driving a reinvigorated innovation lineup.","Legacy

CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we said in Q2, we expect that innovation to lead to improved Pinnacle trends in the second half of fiscal 2020. It also enabled us to gain traction on delevering. In the short five months since closing the Pinnacle transaction, we've reduced debt by $685 million. Overall, we are confident we will deliver quality long-term growth at Conagra and we'll share our robust innovation pipeline and new long-term financial algorithm on April 10th along with details of the increased cost synergy opportunities that we see. Before I get into the quarter, let me talk a bit more about the Conagra Way. We'll unpack this even further at Investor Day, but this playbook is our bedrock and you've seen us execute it for several years now. The Conagra Way to profitable growth is relentlessly principle based and firmly grounded in the consumer. It advocates that growth is essential and that we cannot and will not cut our way to prosperity.","Innovation, Deleveraging, Growth, The Conagra Way, Investor Day",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"It acknowledges that our ability to build strong brands requires differentiated capabilities, particularly those that fuel innovation; areas like demand science, precision marketing, and omni-commerce. And the Conagra Way recognizes that our success requires a highly disciplined approach to portfolio management, which you've seen us execute consistently for the past four years. Importantly, our disciplined approach is repeatable and scalable. It built our healthy and growing frozen and snacks businesses and serves as the basis for how we're approaching the rest of our portfolio, including Pinnacle. We're confident about how we do things around here because it works. We don't take shortcuts. We do things the right way, a way that best positions us for maximum value creation over the long haul.

CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"First up is the Legacy Conagra business. We continued to deliver good consumption growth in our Legacy Conagra segments in the quarter with strong trends on both a year-over-year and two-year basis. As you can see on Slide 8, Legacy Conagra's domestic retail segments had another good quarter. Q3 growth in our Legacy segments was once again based on solid fundamentals tied to the increasing strength of our brands. Our retail sales and base velocities remained in fertile territory and continued to gain momentum on a two-year basis. Turning to our segment results. Refrigerated & Frozen was up 240 basis points in the quarter with Frozen again delivering terrific growth, 490 basis points. Refrigerated was down but as I mentioned last quarter, apart from Reddi-wip, we have yet to renovate these brands and bring new innovation to the marketplace.","Legacy

But turning back to Frozen, we've talked a lot in prior quarters about the successful implementation of our playbook in Frozen. As you can see on Slide 10, that success continued in Q3. We reinvigorated and continued to lead the Frozen category and our fundamentals remained strong in the quarter with improvement in consumption trends, TPDs, and base sales velocity. Our approach is having a positive impact on our results and importantly, it's also driving category growth in frozen single-serve meals. Our rigorous approach to modernizing and premiumizing our brands through renovation and innovation has delivered impact for Conagra and for our customers.

The team has done a lot of great work to develop a strong multi-year pipeline of innovation across our Legacy Conagra frozen brands and across refrigerated brands like Hebrew National, Egg Beaters, and Reddi-wip. Turning to our Legacy Conagra Grocery & Snacks segment, we have more positive news to report. The snacks business grew by 8.2% during the quarter. This tremendous growth validates our recent investment in the business. Looking at our snacks business in more detail on Slide 14. The growth we delivered in Q3 came with contributions from every key snacking vertical; popcorn, meat snacks, sweet treats,and seeds. On a two-year basis, retail dollar sales for our Legacy Conagra snacking portfolio were up an impressive 14%. Dissecting the snacks growth which we've done on Slide 15; you'll see that while TPD's were down, base velocities increased significantly.","Innovation,
Legacy Conagra Frozen Brands, Refrigerated Brands, Snacks Business, Two-Year Basis",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In other words, our growth in snacks during the quarter was driven by bringing terrific products to market that consumers wanted. Those products were in high demand and moved off shelves very quickly and growth through improved consumer pull is sustainable growth. Of course TPDs have been an important metric in assessing brand health historically, but TPDs are not always a helpful barometer of brand vitality. As an example, look at the Slim Jim results. Slim Jim is one of our healthiest brands and is driving strong snacks growth, but Slim Jim's TPDs declined nearly 18% year-over-year as we optimized our assortment. With that data point alone, you'd think the brand was struggling, but it was not. Velocity was up more than 28% and the net result was a retail sales improvement of more than 7% in the quarter. Our Slim Jim business became stronger by increasing shelf inventory and facings on our best selling, fastest moving items and by pruning low velocity SKUs.","Sustainable
Growth, Consumer Pull, Brand Vitality, Optimization, Retail Sales Improvement",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"These actions led to higher sales for both Conagra and our customers and TPDs did not tell the story. We saw the exact same dynamic on Swiss Miss in Q3 and I share this because it's a good reminder that TPD optimization does not always come through TPD growth. I'm very excited about the innovation that we deployed across snacks in the last year and even more excited about the impact of that innovation, but we're not even close to being done. To the point I highlighted earlier regarding Refrigerated & Frozen, our innovation and renovation machine is humming and we have a terrific multi-year pipeline built out for the brands you see here. I won't go further into it now, you'll have to wait until Investor Day. So in summary on Legacy Conagra, we feel very good about our momentum. We're pleased with the results we delivered in Q3 and are confident that with the Conagra Way, we'll continue to deliver.","Innovation, TPD

CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Turning to Pinnacle priorities on Slide 18. It's been a short five months since we completed our acquisition of Pinnacle, we've accomplished a great deal in that time with much more to come. I'll spend a few minutes covering each of our focus areas, integrating the business; reinvigorating Birds Eye, Duncan Hines, and Wish-Bone via innovation; and deleveraging. First, let's talk about the integration. I couldn't be happier with our progress on this front so far. We've said all along that the similarities between Legacy Conagra and Pinnacle made a combination of our two companies an obvious opportunity and the fact that we've been able to quickly align our organizations and deliver our integration work plan to-date is evidence of how well the two companies mesh. Put a finer point on it, work transitions are on track and processes are being aligned; systems integration are well on their way with key milestones being hit; and importantly, we captured approximately $12 million of cost synergy in Q3 which paces ahead of our expectations.","Integration,
Innovation, Deleveraging, Cost Synergy, Pinnacle Priorities",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We continue to expect to over deliver the $215 million of cost synergies we previously announced and we'll share more detail on refined cost synergy opportunities next month. Thank you to the entire Conagra team across Legacy Conagra and Pinnacle for all their terrific work to-date on the integration. We've also been spending time in Q3 undertaking a concentrated effort to begin deploying the Conagra Way to the Pinnacle portfolio and first up is our proven value over volume philosophy. We are starting the process of cutting slower turning and lower margin SKUs while redesigning Pinnacle's customer investments for better ROI. Retail sales and TPDs continued their downward trends in Q3, but base velocities improved as shown in the chart on the right. Non-investment grade SKUs were the ones being pruned in the quarter and that means that the Pinnacle products remaining on shelf are higher quality and generating consumer takeaway.","Cost Synergies,
Conagra Way, SKU Pruning, Retail Sales, Base Velocities",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As we did with our Legacy Conagra business several years ago, we are creating a stronger foundation on which to build. While we won't be happy until total retail sales begin to turn in the Pinnacle portfolio, we are confident that the value over volume process under way gives us that stronger foundation. As we introduce future innovation slates into the market, the net result will be more profitable sustainable growth. To be clear, our Pinnacle-related work is incredibly focused. Right now, it's all about strengthening Pinnacles Big 3; Birds Eye, Duncan Hines, and Wish-Bone. Pinnacle historically referred to these brands as leadership brands and with good reason. However, in the second half of last year, each of these businesses struggled with executional issues. These challenges hurt sales and profit representing the vast majority of Pinnacle's drop off on each.","Stronger
Foundation, Total Retail Sales, Innovation Slate, Executional Issues, Second Half",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"While recent performance in these great brands has been below historical norms, as we discussed last quarter, we're confident that we can reinvigorate them through great innovation and Q3 brought the beginning of our implementation of focused action plans for each brand. First, let's talk about Birds Eye. Birds Eye is an iconic billion dollar brand previously the largest in the Pinnacle portfolio and now the largest in the Conagra portfolio. Recently, however, the Birds Eye brand was slow to respond to key consumer trends, opting out of innovating in important growth pockets. That is changing. The differentiating capabilities that come with the Conagra Way include a well-developed innovation muscle and the know-how to identify and capitalize on consumer trends. Applying these capabilities to Birds Eye means that we're not only opting in to the innovation opportunities in this key category, but opting in in a big way.","Birds Eye,
Innovation, Consumer Trends, Portfolio Size, Conagra Way",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Here again we've already built a multi-year pipeline of innovation and renovation that will deliver a sequenced deluge of new Birds Eye products. We'll share a lot more in April. Now let's turn to Duncan Hines. While Duncan Hines' recent results have been disappointing, it faces a different situation than Birds Eye. Recall the Duncan Hines brand actually did a fair amount of innovation over the past two years. The brand moved into broader snacking with a very innovative idea for Mug Cakes. With this innovation, the Pinnacle team was clearly heading in the right direction. However, the execution of that innovation was not up to our standards. Inefficient SKUs proliferated while competitors entered the space with a more provocative execution, generated better velocities, and gained share. And that new innovation from the competition caused Duncan Hines to suffer. The good news is that we see the solutions here as straightforward even if they'll take a bit of time to cycle into the marketplace.","Innovation,
Execution, Competition, Standards, Solutions",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 23 shows how deploying the Conagra Way to Duncan Hines is leading to a restage of the product with simplified branding, a larger size impression, an optimized SKU range, and an upgraded product with the simple addition of the hero ingredient consumers want, frosting. And finally, let's talk about Wish-Bone where the situation is again unique. In the summer of 2018 Wish-Bone labels were updated, but unfortunately the execution came up short. Despite a more modern design, the labels did not effectively communicate the flavor variety and variety communication is absolutely essential in salad dressing. Take a look at the picture on the left. The modernized label communication was flawed and sales velocities declined quickly and considerably following the label change. Fortunately, this issue has an obvious fix. The right side of Slide 24 shows our updated label. It prominently features the dressing variety.","Deploying
Conagra Way, Simplified Branding, Larger Size Impression, Optimized SKU Range, Hero Ingredient",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Again, a simple solution, but one that will take a bit of time to cycle into the marketplace. After it does, we believe that consumer takeaway for this iconic brand will improve. Overall, the health of the big three Pinnacle brands is critically important and you can be assured that our teams have spent the last five months incredibly focused on each of them. There is definitely more work to do and it will take some time for customers to add our new innovation into their shelf resets. Again as we said in Q2, we expect innovation to lead to improved Pinnacle trends in the second half of fiscal 2020. But the point I want you to take away today is that we have dug into what exactly ails each brand and we are squarely on top of the solutions. But topline growth isn't our only focus, we're also focused on improving margins across the Pinnacle portfolio and generating more cash from each dollar sold.","Simple Solution,
Focused Work, Customer Innovation, Second Half Growth, Margin Improvement",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Over the last several years we've built capabilities that address each of the margin levers noted on Slide 25 and deployed them across the Legacy Conagra portfolio. And now we're focused on getting Pinnacle's gross margins back on track with solid realized productivity above our cost synergy initiatives, margin accretive innovation, improved pricing capabilities, a better brand mix, a better channel mix, and trade optimization. In other words, we're intensely focused on infusing the Conagra Way into Pinnacle. Part of this is simply ensuring that our newest team members, those from Pinnacle, understand the fundamentals of our approach. I've always said that the cultures at Conagra and Pinnacle have many overlaps, particularly with respect to our common embrace of a lean and agile culture and that's still my belief.","Margin Levers,

CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"But we also approach some things differently and we're excited to share our Conagra processes and tools, particularly those that drive innovation based growth such as demand science, precision marketing, and omni-channel selling. I'm proud of how our combined organization is working together in the short time since the completion of the deal. Shifting to our balance sheet, I'm very pleased with our disciplined focus on deleveraging in the last five months. We're committed to a solid investment grade credit rating and as I said earlier, in a little less than five months since closing the transaction, we've already reduced debt by $685 million. We expect leverage ratios to improve over time as we increase our EBITDA growth from both the realization of cost synergies and the application of the Conagra Way to the Pinnacle portfolio. We will also continue to prioritize debt reduction in our approach to capital allocation.","Conagra

CAG,2019,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I want to be clear that while we always view our portfolio with a lens toward optimizing growth and returns, we do not expect to need to make any additional divestitures in order to hit our leverage target. Looking ahead, you can be certain that we will not take our foot off the gas in the Legacy Conagra business and we've already mobilized to aggressively apply our playbook to the Pinnacle portfolio and we'll continue to work to return those brands to growth. Finally, we remain squarely focused on executing our margin enhancing capabilities across the entire Company. As you probably glean from my remarks so far, we've got a great Investor Day coming up in a few weeks. As I mentioned earlier, we will be going into depth on the Conagra Way, how it has benefited Legacy Conagra and how it's being applied to Pinnacle to build long-term sustainable growth. And while we've previewed a couple of the innovations we've been working on, there's a full slate of new products on deck that we will show you.","Growth, Returns,

And finally, we will be providing updates to our financial algorithm, including new data on cost synergies. We hope that you will be able to join us in Chicago on April 10th.

CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through the quarter and elements of both the Legacy Conagra and Pinnacle businesses. With approximately two months left in fiscal 2019 and the sale of the Wesson oil business now complete, I will also share our perspectives on the balance of the year. Slide 31 outlines our performance for the quarter. Net sales for the third quarter were up 35.7% compared to a year ago, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. Organic net sales, excluding the effect of the sale of Trenton, were up 1.9%. Organic net sales growth was largely in line with our expectations driven by the strong performance of our Legacy Conagra domestic retail segments, which when taken together exceeded 2.5% organic growth in the quarter. For the quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 30.5% to $781 million and adjusted gross margin declined 115 basis points to 28.9%.","Growth, Sales,
Performance, Organic Growth, Margin",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"While we continued to make good progress in driving Legacy Conagra realized productivity and price mix, Pinnacle's gross margin of 26.2% in the quarter reduced total Company gross margin. In addition, the shift from A&P expense to above the line brand building investments with retailers reduced gross margin by approximately 100 basis points. I'll walk through the adjusted gross margin bridge shortly. In line with that shift, total Company A&P expense decreased 13.9% to $67 million or 2.5% of net sales in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was up 23.4% compared to the prior year and was 10.1% of net sales. The increase was driven by the addition of Pinnacle expenses, partially offset by synergies and lower incentive compensation expense due to a lower stock price compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating profit increased 47.5% for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 16.3%, up 130 basis points compared to the year ago period exceeding expectations.","Gross Margin, A&P

CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Adjusted EBITDA increased 35.9% to $554 million from $408 million a year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.51 for the quarter, down 16.4% from the prior year. I will review the drivers of Q3 EPS performance in a moment. Slide 32 outlines the drivers of our net sales change versus the same period a year ago. Organic net sales growth ex Trenton of 1.9% reflects a 120 basis point increase in Legacy Conagra volume. Total price mix contributed 70 basis points as favorable price mix of 210 basis points was partially offset by increased brand building investments with retailers of 140 basis points. Total Conagra net sales grew 35.7% driven by a 34.3% net benefit from the acquisitions of Pinnacle and Sandwich Bros., the divestiture of the Canadian Del Monte business, and our exit of the foodservice business produced in the Trenton facility. FX negatively impacted net sales by 50 basis points versus the prior year.","EBITDA, EPS, Net
Sales, Price Mix, Acquisitions",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Slide 33 outlines our net sales performance by reporting segment. The Grocery & Snacks segment grew reported and organic net sales by 2.9% driven by continued excellent performance in the Legacy Conagra snacks business. Net sales of snacks increased 8.2% in the quarter led by strong end market performance by Orville Redenbacher, ACT II, Snack Pack, Slim Jim, and Duke's. The Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued its momentum in the third quarter with reported net sales growth of 3.3% and organic net sales growth of 2.4%. The acquisition of Sandwich Bros., which closed in the third quarter last year, added 90 basis points to the net sales growth. Volume grew 3.5% behind strong growth across the frozen portfolio, including Marie Callender's, Healthy Choice, Banquet, P.F. Chang's, and Frontera.","Grocery & Snacks,
Refrigerated & Frozen, Acquisition, Volume Growth, End Market Performance",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The International segment's organic net sales were down 90 basis points in the quarter as favorable price mix was more than offset by volume declines concentrated in certain global export markets that benefited favorably in the prior year quarter from hurricane related shipments. Foodservice organic net sales declined 60 basis points in the quarter as the segment continued to execute its value over volume strategy. These benefits can be seen in the strong Foodservice profitability metrics I will review shortly. Page 34 shows Q3 and implied Q4 net sales for Pinnacle versus a pro forma prior year number adjusted for Conagra's fiscal calendar and accounting policies. For Q3, Pinnacle net sales reflects a mid-single digit percentage point decline versus the comparable year ago period on a pro forma basis. As expected, overall consumption declined during the quarter driven by Birds Eye, Wish-Bone, and Duncan Hines.","International,
Foodservice, Net Sales, Volume, Consumption",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We also exited low ROI promotions. Additionally, the segment's year-over-year performance was negatively impacted by this year's later Easter holiday season. To help you better understand Pinnacles net sales on our fiscal calendar, we have included estimated Q4 Pinnacle net sales versus a pro forma prior year. We have also included additional pro forma sales detail in the appendix of today's presentation. Moving to Slide 35, you can see that Legacy Conagra adjusted operating profit increased 10.3% and Legacy Conagra adjusted operating margin came in at 16.5% for the third quarter, significantly above year ago performance. Note the 326 basis point improvement in Foodservice adjusted operating margin for Q3 versus the prior year as the segment executes its value over volume strategy. The Pinnacle segment's adjusted operating profit totaled $130 million.","ROI, Promotions,
Easter Holiday, Operating Profit, Margin",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"This performance was above expectations due to lower SG&A and approximately $12 million of synergies realized during the quarter, which were delivered ahead of schedule. The Pinnacle segment's adjusted operating margin was 18.2% or 15.6% when including the $19 million of adjusted Pinnacle general corporate expenses that had been accounted for in the Company's total corporate expenses and not in the Pinnacle reporting segment. Total Conagra adjusted operating profit was up 47.5% versus a year ago and adjusted operating margin was 16.3% for the third quarter, up 130 basis points. Slide 36 outlines the adjusted gross margin change for the quarter. As you can see, realized productivity and favorable price mix improved gross margin 260 basis points, more than offsetting inflation during the quarter and covering the increase in continued investments and brand building with retailers.","SG&A, Synergies,
Operating Margin, Gross Margin, Inflation",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The gross margin of 26.2% on Pinnacle reduced overall Conagra gross margin 100 basis points versus the prior year. Slide 37 details Pinnacle's adjusted profit margins by comparing performance this quarter to the most comparable Pinnacle Foods quarter a year ago from their earnings release, which was Pinnacle's first quarter of calendar year 2018. Pinnacle's Q3 adjusted gross margin declined 100 basis points versus this prior year comparison. Certain Pinnacle expenses were reclassified from cost of goods sold to SG&A to conform to Conagra's accounting policies in the third quarter. Without this reclassification, Pinnacle's Q3 gross margin would have been down approximately 200 basis points. Headwinds to gross margin came from inflation on crops, packaging and transportation, increased business investments, and unfavorable volume mix and absorption. These headwinds were partially offset by continued realized productivity in the Pinnacle business.","Gross Margin,
Pinnacle, Profit Margins, SG&A, Inflation",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"As Sean mentioned, we are deploying the Conagra Way to improve Pinnacle gross margins moving forward and we'll discuss this more at Investor Day. Pinnacle's adjusted operating margin, which was not impacted by the accounting reclassification, was flat year-on-year. Operating margins benefited from SG&A favorability and $12 million in synergy capture. These tailwinds offset gross margin declines and an increase in transaction related amortization. Slide 38 outlines the drivers of our adjusted EPS performance for the quarter versus a year ago. The bridge shows Legacy Conagra EPS drivers followed by Pinnacle adjusted operating profit and the incremental capital costs associated with the acquisition. Starting on the left, Legacy Conagra EPS performance was driven by increased adjusted operating profit, which was offset by lower pension and post retirement net -- non-service income due to reduced asset return assumptions related to fully funding the pension plan last year.","Gross Margins, SG&A,
Synergies, EPS, Acquisition",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"EPS was also reduced by lower adjusted equity method investment earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture as well as a higher Q3 adjusted effective tax rate of 24.3% versus 19.7% a year ago due to the prior year rate impact of passing tax reform. The impact of increased Pinnacle adjusted operating profit offset by higher incremental interest expense and share dilution from Pinnacle acquisition financing reduced EPS by approximately $0.08. Slide 39 summarizes select balance sheet and cash flow information. Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $745 million for the 39 weeks ended Q3, down versus the prior year. This decline was all realized in the first half as Q3 cash flow was up versus Q3 in the prior year. CapEx for the 39 weeks ended Q3 was $236 million or approximately 3.4% of net sales for the same period, in line with our expectations.","EPS, Tax Reform,

CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"In the quarter, we paid a dividend at an annualized rate of $0.85 per share. Gross debt was $11.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, a reduction of $435 million versus the end of Q2. Net debt at the end of the third quarter was $10.8 billion and the net debt leverage ratio was approximately 4.9 times on the latest 12-months pro forma EBITDA, in line with our expectations. Since the end of the third quarter through today, we have paid off another $250 million in debt. At the end of the third quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately nine years; our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7%, and total fixed rate debt approximated 83%. As of today, our variable rate term loan balance has been reduced from $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter to $600 million. We remain committed to a solid investment grade credit rating and achieving our leverage ratio target of 3.5 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA by the end of fiscal '21.","Dividend, Debt,

CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"As Sean noted, we do not expect that any additional divestitures will be required for us to achieve our target leverage ratio. We believe that any further divestitures could accelerate our timetable to achieve the target ratio. Slide 40 summarizes our updated fiscal year 2019 outlook for both the Legacy Pinnacle segment and total Conagra inclusive of the impact of Pinnacle from the closing date of October 26, 2018 to the end of the Conagra fiscal year on May 26, 2019. The updated organic net sales growth guidance removes Wesson for the entire fiscal year. All other metrics include Wesson's actual results only for the time period the business was owned and now exclude expected results for the remainder of the fiscal year. We expect organic net sales growth ex Trenton to be approximately 1%. We expect Pinnacle reported net sales to be within the original net sales guidance range and we've now tightened that range to $1.71 billion to $1.73 billion.","Leverage Ratio,

CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Our guidance on profit metrics is changing to reflect our ongoing real-time A&P optimization. We now expect adjusted gross margin for total Conagra to be below the previously provided range of 29.3% to 29.6%. Again, the primary drivers of this are the continued brand building investments with retailers along with increased cost of goods sold investments to support product and packaging innovation, and higher inflation on the Pinnacle business. Despite the lower gross margin, we expect adjusted operating margin to be above the range of 14.9% to 15.2% driven by more favorable SG&A expense as well as faster synergy capture. We are reaffirming our expectations for the effective tax rate and we now expect total Company net interest expense to be favorable and below the prior range of $390 million to $395 million as we have reduced debt ahead of our forecast. We have no change in our expected full-year share count.","Gross Margin, SG&A Expense,
Synergy Capture, Effective Tax Rate, Net Interest Expense",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We are also reaffirming our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.03 to $2.08. We expect our improved operating margin and lower interest expense to offset the EPS impacts of the Wesson divestiture and lower-than-expected equity method investment earnings. Finally, we expect to exceed our prior synergy target of $20 million for fiscal 2019 and we are reaffirming our expectation for transaction-related amortization. As Sean mentioned, we will provide an update on synergies at Investor Day. Slide 41 provides a bit more detail on the organic net sales growth guidance. As I noted before, our prior guidance included Wesson for the full year. We are now excluding Wesson from our revised figure. By removing Wesson, our year-to-date organic sales growth increased by 20 basis points. Based on our performance through Q3, our guidance of approximately 1% organic net sales growth for the fiscal year excluding Wesson implies organic net sales growth of approximately 1.7% for the fourth quarter.","EPS, Synergy Capture, Net Sales

Fiscal 2019 is off to a good start, with performance in the first quarter largely in-line with our expectations. We sustained our solid top-line performance, delivering net sales growth in each of the four operating segments behind strong underlying fundamentals, and our operating margin came in slightly above our expectations despite a continued challenging inflationary environment. We continued to optimize our marketing investments to deliver a stronger ROI. Once again, this included shifting some low ROI investments from A&P marketing to above-the-line retailer investments.

Brand Affinity, Physical Availability, Mental Availability",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 9 provides more context on our approach. We make marketing investments based on their ability to increase physical and mental availability because our products need to be easy to find and quick to mind. I'll touch first on physical availability. Ensuring our products are easy to find requires that we have great products and packaging design, but it's more than that. As I mentioned earlier, we need our products placed where the consumers are and timed to be available when they want to buy them. We need to be in store and online, across channels and across stores, and this takes investment.","Physical Availability, Mental
Availability, Marketing Investments, Products and Packaging Design, Channel and Store Distribution",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We also need our products to be quick to mind because it's not just about showing up. More importantly, it's about getting noticed. Clearly, we are doing a better job at that today than we had done historically. What's behind that is a wholesale overhaul of how we drive mental availability. In the old days, it was done exclusively through A&P spend and almost all of that was in the form of traditional TV and print advertising. These days, the majority of our A&P marketing is in the form of highly efficient digital and social marketing. Further, we now have the analytical capability to be able to identify those A&P investments that are not working. When we find them, we eliminate those programs and redeploy the investments with retailers. These enhanced partnerships with retailers are helping our brands get noticed and be appreciated for the relevant innovative benefits they bring consumers.","Mental Availability, Marketing

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And for those of you trained to believe that above-the-line marketing spend is deep discounting, think again. Slide 10 clearly outlines that our average unit price change has been positive every quarter for more than two years. In addition, the percentage of products sold on promotion has decreased in all but one quarter over that same time period. We'll stay true to our value-over-volume strategy and focus on making disciplined investments and building brand equity, not low-quality promotions.","Value-Over-Volume Strategy,

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Turning to our refrigerated and frozen segment on Slide 11, as you know, this has been a key area of focus for us in terms of improving our top line trend given the strong underlying category fundamentals and our untapped brand potential. We continued to drive organic net sales growth in the quarter, reflected in the quarterly sales chart on the left side of the page. Now, some of you may see the chart on the left and think growth is slowing. But take a look at the chart on the right. On a two-year basis, growth has been accelerating. We are now showing growth on top of growth.","Refrigerated and Frozen Segment, Top

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As you can see on Slide 12, within the segment, the momentum in our frozen business continues to accelerate. Consumption growth remains very strong and we're seeing this growth in the current quarter, and taking a look at the right-hand side of the page, on a two-year basis. And the good news is that we believe we still have a lot of room to grow in frozen. As our distribution performance continues to improve, we expect dollar sales growth to continue to follow suit. Going forward, we're confident in our ability to further grow TPDs because of the exciting new innovation hitting the shelves during fiscal 2019.","Frozen Business Momentum,

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"This fiscal year's innovation slate is broader than fiscal 2018's, as we are expanding frozen into new day parts with an eye on modern wellness and new cuisine offerings. We're also introducing new handheld options. This slide includes some of our new innovations from Healthy Choice, Marie Callender's, P.F. Chang's, and Odom's Tennessee Pride.

Our single-serve meals are the fastest growing, both in terms of retail sales and total points of distribution. While we're pleased with the progress in our frozen portfolio, we're not resting on what we've accomplished to-date. We continue to see years of runway in frozen and expect the space to benefit from the long-term demographic tailwinds we spoke about at CAGNY.

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Turning to our grocery and snacks segment on Slide 15, while it's still early days in our efforts to renovate brands in this segment and provide the appropriate support behind them, we are pleased to have returned to positive organic net sales growth on a year-over-year basis in the last two quarters, led by the snacks business.

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Most of the discussion regarding this segment will be focused on the snacks and sweet treats businesses where we see tremendous opportunity.

Opportunity, Grocery Portfolio, Iconic Brands, Renovation",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"As those of you who are more familiar with our company know, some brands in our portfolio are what we describe as ""reliable contributors."" These are not brands that we expect to deliver outsized growth but they are also not brands that we ignore or allow to atrophy. In fact, it's quite the opposite. We surgically invest in these brands to ensure they will continue to generate stable, consistent cash flow to help drive growth.","Reliable Contributors, Brand

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"One example of a reliable contributor is Chef Boyardee, highlighted on Slide 16. This summer, we launched Chef Boyardee throwback recipes, reminiscent of those dishes Chef Hector Boyardee actually cooked up back in the day, made with high-quality, simple ingredients. This is a premium product at a premium price and it's margin accretive to the base Chef Boyardee offering.

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And as a nod to the nostalgic Chef jingle from yesteryear, we very efficiently created a music video to promote Chef Boyardee Throwback. This fun video is a mashup of the new and the old. It features Lil Yachty, a popular rapper, singer, and songwriter, with Donny Osmond. Amazingly, this song reached No. 3 on Spotify's Most Viral playlist and there's been a tremendous amount of user-generated content through Instagram and Snapchat.

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Now, turning to Slide 17, as a reminder, we have a nearly $2 billion snacks and sweet treats business and we see tremendous opportunity to grow it. Our portfolio in snacks is large but focused, and as we have shifted our efforts to manage these brands the way snack businesses are meant to be run, with a greater focus on speed, agility, and innovation, we've started to see the impact of our efforts. The snacking universe is performing well overall and our categories are growing. On top of that, we are gaining share.

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Consumption trends in snacks and sweet treats are also positive, as shown on Slide 19. Again, our two-year CAGR shows just how much we've delivered in recent years. Our two-year growth in snacks and sweet treats continues to accelerate and the great news is that we're just getting started. At the upcoming National Association of Convenience Store Show, also known as NACS, in Las Vegas, we will debut our new approach to snacks and sweet treats to retailers.

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 21 illustrates a few of the things we're doing within snacks, starting with innovation and price/pack architecture. We are ramping up our core innovation capabilities as we recognize the need to be faster and introduce new varieties across our portfolio. We're also focusing on optimizing our price/pack architecture with multiple product configurations. This is particularly important, not only in C stores where we already have a strong position, but also in other outlets, like drug and dollar.","Innovation, Price/Pack Architecture,

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We're also taking a more innovative approach to shelving and displays. This means getting off the shelf, where some of our traditional grocery products play, and creating new points of interruption in-store in secondary and tertiary displays. These innovative display vehicles are intended to help keep our brands top-of-mind with consumers, drive impulse purchases, and accelerate our sales growth.","Innovative Approach, Shelving,
Displays, Top-of-Mind Consumers, Impulse Purchases",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And, finally, we're taking a new approach to channel penetration. Historically, we have focused primarily on the traditional channels: grocery, C store, supercenter, club, and dollar. As a snacks business, we recognize the importance of having a ubiquitous presence, which means selling across the continuum, including QSR, on-premise, and eCommerce. The concept I discussed earlier, investing to drive both physical availability and mental availability, is critical in this business. Snacks are available everywhere and always within reach. That's why it's important for our brands to be in every channel in which consumers expect to see snacks.","New Approach, Channel Penetration,
Ubiquitous Presence, Mental Availability, Physical Availability",Conagra Brands
CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"It's also important for us to stay top-of-mind, the mental availability I mentioned. Some of our investments in new channel penetration, such as in coffee shops, won't necessarily drive meaningful volume. But those investments are extremely meaningful in terms of getting in front of our consumers and positioning the brand. We've made progress on this front with several of our key snack brands. You'll see brands such as Angie's Boom Chicka Pop at coffee shops, Duke's on airplanes, and David seeds at ballparks across the country. In addition, we're continuing the focus on the eCommerce channel, which has also led to over 40% growth in ConAgra's eCommerce sales for the last quarter.","Top-of-Mind, Mental Availability,

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So, to wrap up, we will continue to roll out innovation to drive top-line momentum, we'll continue to focus relentlessly on margin drivers to fuel growth, and we will remain disciplined in our strategic investments to drive brand saliency, distribution, and consumer trial.","Innovation, Margin Drivers, Brand

CAG,2019,1,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"During the second quarter, our year-over-year comparisons, particularly in the grocery and snacks and foodservice segments, will be challenged by the impact of last year's hurricanes, which drove a 200 basis point increase in net sales growth in that period. However, this is just a timing issue in Q2 and Q3 and, again, we are reaffirming our full-year fiscal 2019 guidance.

CAG,2019,1,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"As planned, adjusted SG&A for the quarter was up 9.7% compared to the prior year and was 11.7% of net sales.

Three years ago this month, I hosted my first call as CEO of ConAgra.

It's been hard work, but we have built a much healthier business and one that is less promotional with a greater percentage of volume coming from loyal households at a higher margin. By investing in renovation and innovation, we've improved the quality of our portfolio and positioned the business for sustainable growth.","primary focus, momentum, underlying sales trends, base velocities, loyal households",Conagra Brands
CAG,2018,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Our aggressive efforts to modernize iconic brands and add new on-trend brands have been critical to driving results. Slide 12 shows a snapshot of our successful innovation efforts in fiscal 2018 with several more on the way in fiscal 2019 and we're just getting started. And finally in order to build a truly winning company overall, we had to look inward at our culture and the way we operate. This resulted in a complete overhaul that has touched every area of the business.","innovation efforts, successful innovation, on-trend brands, cultural overhaul, winning

CAG,2018,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We right-sized the organizations and now have fewer layers and broader spans of control, resulting in a lean company with a focus on self-service. And across the board, we've made an effort to encourage a collaborative work environment, making ConAgra a better place to work and fostering a results-oriented culture of innovation and productivity. All of this has translated into very strong returns for our shareholders. Since the Board prepared to move in a new direction in August of 2014, total shareholder return is nearly 104%, almost doubling the return of the S&P 500.","right-sizing, lean company, collaborative work environment, strong returns, total

CAG,2018,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So, that's the backdrop to today's exciting announcement. The bottom line here is that in the past three years, we have done heavy lifting in order to build a strong platform for future growth while also generating tremendous shareholder value. Importantly, it has positioned us to acquire Pinnacle Foods and accelerate our ability to generate value. By acquiring Pinnacle, we're combining two portfolios with industry-leading growth to create an $11 billion company with iconic brands in frozen, snacking, refrigerated and grocery categories.","heavy lifting, strong platform, shareholder value, acquiring Pinnacle, iconic brands",Conagra Brands
CAG,2018,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The new company will be a leader in frozen foods and will have enhanced scale overall to better partner with customers. In addition to our complementary portfolios, ConAgra and Pinnacle have similar results-oriented cultures. We believe Pinnacle will be an excellent cultural and operational fit. When coupled with our proven track record of executing strategic transactions, we will be able to implement a smooth integration process.","new company, frozen foods, scale, cultural fit, integration process",Conagra Brands
CAG,2018,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"In addition to the strategic and cultural benefits, we expect attractive financial returns with an IRR above our WACC and EPS accretion in the first full fiscal year following close. Dave will take you through the details, but let me point out a few highlights of the transaction. Pinnacle's shareholders will receive an implied value of $68 per share in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $10.9 billion. This transaction price represents a 15.8 times adjusted EBITDA multiple before synergies based on Pinnacle's estimated fiscal year 2018 results and 12.1 times adjusted EBITDA, including run-rate cost synergies.","strategic benefits, cultural benefits, financial returns, transaction details, multiple",Conagra Brands
CAG,2018,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS in fiscal '20 with that accretion increasing as strong cost synergies phase in. As we have said many times before, we remain committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating with a focus on de-leveraging over the next few years. We expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar 2018, subject to Pinnacle's shareholder approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Now, for those of you who may not be familiar with Pinnacle, the company's full-year 2017 net sales were $3.1 billion, the majority of which came from its frozen and grocery segments.","transaction accretion, credit rating, de-leveraging, regulatory approvals, Pinnacle

Like ConAgra, Pinnacle has been a leader in innovation and has delivered solid top-line results over time. Following the completion of the transaction, the new ConAgra Brands portfolio will be comprised of iconic brands with leading positions in strong categories.

For our most recent fiscal quarter, ConAgra Brands had the second highest year-over-year growth rate in the industry and Pinnacle was fourth. We believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to continue strong consumption trends with the expanded brand portfolio and broader in-store reach of the combined company. Slide 20 demonstrates how the acquisition will improve our overall scale as well as our position in frozen foods.","fastest growing portfolios, industry growth rate, brand portfolio, broader in-store

While I already touched on frozen, this transaction also enhances our portfolio of brands across other attractive domains, including snacks and sweet treats. As we've discussed before, this domain is an extremely compelling and exciting opportunity.

CAG,2018,4,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Much like ConAgra, Pinnacle shares our focus on innovation and on maintaining a lean and efficient operating structure and close ties with customers. This like-minded approach will be critical as we combine the two companies. So in summary, the strategic rationale is clear.

At the same time, we will remain committed to a healthy capital structure, including a solid investment-grade rating. With our greater scale across leading iconic brands and an unwavering focus on driving innovation and profitable growth and a strong balance sheet and cash flow, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to drive long-term shareholder value.With that, I'll hand the call over to Dave to share more financial details on the transaction and on our fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 results.

CAG,2018,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reiterating how excited we are about this transaction. I will start by sharing some additional details pertaining to the deal and we'll then briefly discuss our strong fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2018 financial performance before we open it up for Q&A.Building on Sean's comments, we are acquiring Pinnacle Foods in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $10.9 billion, including Pinnacle's outstanding net debt of $2.7 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Pinnacle's shareholders will receive $43.11 in cash and 0.6494 shares of ConAgra stock for each share they hold, equating to an implied price of $68 per Pinnacle share.","transaction details, financial performance, deal valuation, shareholder value, Q&A",Conagra Brands
CAG,2018,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Pinnacle's shareholders are expected to own approximately 16% of the combined company, assuming our issuance of incremental equity to the public to assist in funding the deal. This transaction price represents an adjusted EBITDA multiple of 15.8 times pre-synergies based on Pinnacle Foods' estimated fiscal-year 2018 results and 12.1 times adjusted EBITDA, including run-rate cost synergies. We secured a committed $9 billion bridge facility until permanent financing is raised. We expect to finance the $10.9 billion transaction by issuing $3 billion of ConAgra Brands' stock to Pinnacle's shareholders and raising $7.9 billion of cash.","transaction price, adjusted EBITDA multiple, financing options, shareholder ownership,

CAG,2018,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The cash is expected to be raised through the issuance of $7.3 billion of transaction debt and the generation of $600 million of incremental cash proceeds from either a public equity offering and/or divestitures. We've assumed that we would issue the full $600 million in equity in calculating the deal metrics, but the ultimate mix of equity issuance and divestitures will depend on timing considerations, credit implications and market conditions. ConAgra Brands' pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio is expected to be approximately five times at closing. ConAgra is committed to a solid investment grade rating and has a targeted leverage ratio of three point five times as we prioritize de-leveraging.","cash raising, transaction debt, equity issuance, divestitures, leverage ratio",Conagra Brands
CAG,2018,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We also expect to refinance all of Pinnacle's debt in connection with the closing. Assuming an end of calendar year 2018 closing, we expect the transaction to be low single-digit accretive to adjusted EPS on a percentage basis in fiscal year 2020, the first full fiscal year following close, and to be high single-digit accretive to adjusted EPS on a percentage basis by fiscal year '22. We are expecting $215 million in run-rate cost synergies by the end of fiscal year '22, which represents approximately 7% of Pinnacle's net sales. We estimate a cash cost to achieve those synergies of $355 million, split approximately 60% operating expense and 40% CAPEX.","refinancing debt, adjusted EPS, cost synergies, cash costs, fiscal year 2020",Conagra Brands
CAG,2018,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The synergies are expected to be driven by savings across procurement, logistics, manufacturing and SG&A. We expect to recognize approximately 60% of the synergies by the end of fiscal year '20, with the remainder phased in through fiscal '22. Our current estimate of incremental and tangible amortization from the deal is $55 million.

CAG,2018,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"We expect to maintain our annual dividend of $0.85 per share during fiscal '19 and in the future, we are targeting modest dividend increases as we prioritize de-leveraging. In late Q4 of fiscal '18, we suspended our share repurchase program. Going forward, we will only repurchase shares if we are tracking ahead of our leverage targets. Also, we have approximately $720 million remaining on our capital loss carry-forward, which does not expire until the end of fiscal year '21.","dividend, share

Now, I realize that you'll have questions regarding the transaction announcement, but before we take your questions, let me quickly summarize our strong earnings results for the fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2018. As Sean mentioned earlier, we continued to execute against our transformation plan in fiscal 2018 and delivered strong fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2018 results. Net sales for the fourth quarter were up 5.6% compared to a year ago. Organic net sales grew 2% driven by solid growth in both of our domestic retail segments.","divest assets,

For the fourth quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 6.1% to $573 million and adjusted gross margin improved 12 basis points to 29.2%. For the full year, adjusted gross profit decreased 0.5% and adjusted gross margin was 29.7%. In the quarter, A&P expense decreased to $59 million or 3% of net sales.","net sales,

CAG,2018,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"For the full year, A&P expense decreased to $279 million or 3.5% of net sales. Our decline in A&P expense was offset by increased retailer marketing investment to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution and consumer trial in store. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was up 3.4% and was 11.1% of net sales.

Slide 31 outlines the puts and takes on our full-year adjusted gross margin decline.

Instead of going through the details of each segment this quarter, I will just call out a few big takeaways. First, in the fourth quarter, all four of our operating segments grew operating profit and expanded operating margin. Second, both domestic retail segments grew organic net sales in the quarter.","Marketing, Operating Profit, Operating Margin, Growth, Segments",Conagra Brands

An increase in adjusted gross profit drove $0.06 of the EPS increase. Lower SG&A and A&P expense added $0.02 of improvement, which was offset by unfavorable interest expense and a slight decrease in the Ardent Mills joint venture income of $0.01. Tax reform and share repurchases added $0.03 of EPS improvement.Slide 35 outlines the drivers of our full-year adjusted EPS improvement of plus 21% versus a year ago.","Momentum,

CAG,2018,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"The slight decrease of $0.02 in adjusted gross profit for the year was more than offset by lower SG&A and A&P expense, which drove $0.10 of the EPS improvement. Another $0.10 of improvement came from increased Ardent Mills joint venture income and favorable interest expense. We saw a $0.06 favorable impact from tax and a $0.13 contribution from share repurchase activity. Slide 36 summarizes select balance sheet and cash flow information for the fiscal year.","Adjusted

CAG,2018,4,Dave Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Net cash flow from operating activities for continuing operations was $920 million for the year, down from $1.1 billion last year primarily driven by the $300 million pension plan contribution we made in the fourth quarter. We had capital expenditures of $252 million, up slightly versus the prior year. During 2018, we paid dividends of $342 million and repurchased approximately $967 million worth of stock.

We are now adding a new line item named pension and postretirement non-service income. The impact of this change is that we will reclassify $86 million of pension income out of adjusted operating profit and into this new line item below adjusted operating profit, reducing adjusted operating margin by 110 basis points.

As we noted last quarter, now that our pension plan is more fully funded, we can reduce future volatility by changing the pension asset mix to a higher percentage of fixed income securities and a lower percentage of equity and other securities. The net impact of this change is a non-cash P&L headwind in fiscal year '19 as the new line item pension and postretirement non-service income will move from $86 million in fiscal '18 to approximately $40 million in fiscal '19. Note that this $46 million income reduction represents approximately $0.09 of negative EPS impact in fiscal '19.On Slide 39, we summarized our stand-alone fiscal 2019 outlook, which does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Pinnacle.","Historical

As part of the transaction, the Foodservice segment exited a non-core co-manufacturing agreement that generated $79 million in net sales in fiscal 2018.

We expect pension and postretirement non-service income of approximately $40 million for fiscal '19. We expect an effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 24%, consistent with what we guided to at CAGNY.

We remain on track to deliver on our three-year stand-alone fiscal 2020 financial algorithm, which uses fiscal 2017 as the base year. As outlined on Slide 41, today, we are truing up our algorithm to reflect changes in pension accounting standards and our strategic decision to shift marketing investments from A&P to above the net sales line retailer marketing.

Due to this marketing shift, adjusted gross margin is now expected to be approximately 30.5%. As a result of the new pension accounting reclassification, adjusted SG&A excluding A&P is now expected to be approximately 11.8%.

Our primary focus this fiscal year has been on the top line and we are particularly pleased with our momentum on this front as underlying sales trends, notably consumption, continue to strengthen across our domestic retail segments.The investments we are making behind our brands to drive enhanced saliency, distribution, and consumer trial are having the intended impacts.","Solid

CAG,2018,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"These investments were largely above the line this quarter and consistent with our strategy to partner with retailers to acquaint our consumer base with our modernized brands and new innovation. The timing of these increased investments converged with greater-than-expected inflation in the quarter, including higher transportation costs, as well as higher-than-expected reductions in retail customer inventories. Combined, these factors created near-term pressure on our gross margin despite the fact that we continue to price ahead of our categories. Our M&A activity continued this quarter.","Investments,

As a reminder, the guidance we most recently provided at CAGNY already accounted for the impact of the tax law changes. Today's incremental increase is based on our underlying performance.

As you will recall from last quarter, our shipments exceeded consumption largely behind the hurricanes. Of our 230-basis-point improvement in top-line growth in Q2, we estimated that approximately 220 basis points were related to the hurricanes.

Our deliberate efforts to cut unprofitable SKUs and pull back on low-quality promotions are now largely behind us.

Total points of distribution are coming back in a much higher-quality fashion, base velocities have improved dramatically and base dollar sales are in positive territory again.As you can see on Slide 12, these trends have allowed us to continue to price above our categories.

It's been heavy lifting but it's also been tremendously rewarding and we are just getting warmed up with another robust innovation slate set to hit the market in fiscal 2019.As most of you know, we started our efforts to bend the top-line trend by focusing on frozen, given the strong underlying fundamentals of the category and the uncapped potential we identified in our brands.

Frozen consumption was up nicely again in the quarter continuing a strong trend in the domain.And we think we have a lot of room to go from here, as our distribution performance continues to improve and dollar sales growth has followed.

By focusing on and leveraging the unique characteristics and strengths of these brands, we've returned each of them to growth and reestablished the relevancy of frozen meals and we see substantial runway for continued growth ahead.As we showcased last month at CAGNY, we are very excited about our fiscal 2019 frozen innovation. We will extend into new dayparts, expand modern wellness and new cuisine offerings, and pursue hand-held options. A sampling of these new innovations can be found here on Slide 18.","Frozen Brands,

CAG,2018,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Taking a step back, one of the things we are most determined about in frozen is that, given our strong performance, we have ample room to capture our fair share of shelf space and grow organically.As highlighted in the chart on Slide 19, we have a much larger share of dollar sales than we have of TPDs. We are working with retailers to highlight this fact. As they review their planograms, we expect them to trim overskewed products, those that are shown above 100 in this index, and add more of the underskewed products, like ours, that have earned more space on the shelf. We expect this to be a tailwind for our frozen business going forward as we gain our fair share of distribution.","Fair Share,

CAG,2018,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Progress we've made in frozen demonstrates that our plan is working and we are not resting on what we've accomplished to date.Turning to our grocery and snacks segment on Slide 20, as we noted earlier, we expected this segment's sales to be down in Q3, given the impact of the hurricanes in Q2. Recall, we saw sales exceed consumption in the second quarter. However, in Q3, sales were down more than expected, primarily related to an unanticipated reduction in retail customer inventory levels near the end of the calendar year. While this adjustment in inventory levels negatively impacted the quarter, we expect this shift in customer behavior to be a one-time transitory occurrence.Despite the unexpected impact of the reduction in retail customer inventory levels in Q3, when you look at the normalized cohort of Q2 and Q3 combined, which removes the impact of these timing dynamics, we remain on track.","Frozen

When you look just at our base business in grocery and snacks, trends are even more encouraging. Non-promoted consumption exceeded our internal expectations in the quarter and we've seen solid share performance as well.

Again, these are encouraging signs and reflect the impact we can have as we bring the right approach to brand building and innovation across our portfolio.We expect to accelerate from here with a particular focus on snacking. We are energizing our snacking playbook with ramped-up innovation, a focus on driving impulse consumption, marketing with a purpose, and better price-pack architecture.

We recognize that today's world requires a different approach to marketing. We are focused on making investments that engage the consumer with our brands and that could include traditional TV and print ads, distribution investments, merchandising, sampling, digital marketing, and even customer loyalty programs. As you can see on Slide 26, we are focused on reaching the consumer where they are on their path to purchase, including by leveraging targeted digital engagements and incentives prior to their arrival in the store.On Slide 27, you can see a sample of some of the brand investments we are making with our retail partners.","Innovation,

CAG,2018,3,Sean Connolly,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Some of our marketing investments may appear above the net sales line and some of it may be below, but the overall goal is to add incremental support, especially where we have new renovation and innovation. These investments will be brand- and customer-specific, as we acquaint consumers with our modernized portfolio and new innovation. And based on our strong consumer trends, these efforts are clearly paying off. As I noted at the outset, the timing of these investments converged with higher than anticipated inflation.As highlighted on Slide 28, inflation is trending well above the 2.7% we anticipated as part of our initial fiscal 2018 guidance.","Marketing

As we've said before, margins may move around quarter to quarter beyond our normal seasonality and as we continue through our transformation, we will look to exit lower-margin businesses and enhance our portfolio with margin-accretive innovation and acquisitions quarter to quarter.

We are proud of the 430 basis points of margin expansion we achieved from fiscal 2015 to 2017 and we are not done.While there were a few transitory factors impacting our gross margin performance in Q3, overall, our operating margin remains strong and our fiscal '18 guidance shows that we continue to see operating margin expansion. Dave will provide a bit more detail on the specific factors that impacted near-term margin performance, but the bottom line is that none of these factors change our long-term margin outlook or our commitment to chip away at the margin opportunity over time.Turning to Slide 31, M&A remains a central part of our plan.

CAG,2018,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"While the third-quarter organic net sales were negatively impacted by hurricane-related timing shifts between the second and third quarters as well as some unexpected customer inventory contractions in the third quarter, we see continued net sales progress. Our value-over-volume strategy and product innovation are working.Second, gross profit was impacted by several factors this quarter, including our intentional choices on how to invest in the top line. We continued to focus our brand building activity on above-the-line marketing investments with retailers and we've reduced A&P investments. This impacted gross margin.We also saw challenges on the cost side.","Value-Over-

CAG,2018,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Our core productivity programs continue to deliver but their benefits were more than offset by significant input cost inflation in the quarter, including transportation. Since we don't provide gross margin results at the segment level, you'll see this flow through to operating margin in the segment performance.Also, the grocery and snacks segment experienced some transitory operating costs that impacted operating profit and margin. While the quarter presented a variety of dynamics to work through, the teams stayed focused on fundamentals and, as you can see, we've reconfirmed our net sales guidance and increased our EPS outlook for the year.So let's dig into the details. Reported net sales for the third quarter were up 0.7% while organic net sales were down 2.2%, reflecting timing shifts in sales between the second and third quarters and overall customer inventories contracting more than anticipated around calendar year-end.","Core Productivity

CAG,2018,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"As Sean mentioned, total organic net sales for the second and third quarter combined grew 0.1%, showing continued positive momentum.Adjusted gross profit dollars were down $27 million, or 4.3%. Adjusted gross margin was 30% for the third quarter, in line with the second quarter and down approximately 155 basis points from the prior year. A&P expense decreased 13.7%, or $12 million. As seen in the second quarter, the decline in A&P was more than offset by increased above-the-line marketing investment with retailers to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial in store.","Total Organic

CAG,2018,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"These retailer investments helped deliver strong consumption growth in the quarter.Adjusted SG&A was relatively flat to the prior year and was 10% of net sales, slightly favorable to the year-ago quarter as we continue to run a lean organization. We like that our adjusted SG&A spend as a percentage of net sales remains top-tier in the industry. Adjusted operating profit was down $12 million, or 3.6% for the quarter.

Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61 for the third quarter, which was up 27.1%, driven primarily by lower tax rates.Slide 35 outlines the drivers of our third-quarter net sales change versus a year ago. Total company organic net sales were down 2.2%. Volume decreased 2.8%, driven mostly by the shift in timing of sales between the second and third quarters as well as a higher than expected reduction in retailer inventories near the calendar year-end, particularly in the grocery and snacks segment.Overall price mix increased primarily from favorable products and customer sales mix in foodservice along with positive pricing in the International segment and favorable price mix in the refrigerated and frozen segment from new products.","Gross Productivity,

CAG,2018,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,This was partially offset by continued increases in above-the-line marketing investments. The acquisitions of the Duke's and Bigs brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and Angie's and Sandwich Bros. in fiscal year 2018 added 240 basis points to third-quarter net sales growth.

CAG,2018,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Inflation in ingredients, packaging, and transportation were the major drivers of gross margin decline. Inflation of 3.7% in the quarter drove approximately $50 million of gross profit decline, negatively impacting gross margin by 2.5 percentage points. Transportation represented approximately 25% of total inflation for the quarter. Above-the-line marketing investments with retailers to drive enhanced distribution and consumer trial represented eight-tenths of a percentage point of the gross margin decline.","Inflation, Gross

CAG,2018,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Favorable price mix and strong gross productivity mitigated some of the gross-margin decline but realized productivity was suppressed due to transitory costs in our grocery and snacks business, which I will discuss shortly.Moving to adjusted operating margin, the 1.6-percentage-point decline in gross margin drove operating margins down for the quarter. This was partially offset by SG&A and A&P favorability as we continued to manage SG&A tightly and shift A&P investment to above-the-line marketing investment with retailers. We expect A&P to fluctuate quarter to quarter as we continue to evaluate the balance between below and above-the-line marketing opportunities.Slide 37 highlights our results by reporting segment.

CAG,2018,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Volume was also impacted by higher than expected retailer inventory reductions and deliberate actions to optimize distribution on certain low-margin items.Additionally, price mix declined approximately 2% as we increased above-the-line marketing investments with retailers. This investment is paying dividends as overall grocery and snacks consumption has improved driven by base velocity improvements, as Sean discussed. Adjusted operating profit of $178 million decreased 16% or $34 million, with adjusted operating margins down approximately 370 basis points versus the prior year. The segment's operating margin compression was driven by four discrete items including some that were transitory in nature.First, input costs and transportation inflation were the largest headwinds on operating profit and margins in the quarter, representing $15 million of operating-profit decline.","Volume, Price Mix,

CAG,2018,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Second, we increased above-the-line marketing investments with retailers to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial of key brands. Consumption improved in both the second and third quarter supported by these investments. Third, despite strong gross productivity cost savings in supply chain, realized productivity in the quarter was reduced by certain transitory operational offsets. For example, we had unexpected plant maintenance and production downtime, higher-than-normal inventory writedowns on certain discontinued and slow-moving items, and unfavorable overhead absorption given the volume declines in the quarter.","Above-the-Line

CAG,2018,3,David Marberger,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Lastly, while the recent growth-focused acquisitions aided the segment's operating profit growth rate, they also reduced the operating margin percentage. This is because these businesses have maintained strong A&P investments as well as elevated SG&A levels as they integrate into the company.In our refrigerated and frozen segment, reported net sales grew to $689 million, a 3.2% increase.

Adjusted operating profit of $127 million decreased 0.6% in the quarter. The benefits of net sales growth and realized productivity improvements were more than offset by increased input cost for proteins, packaging, and higher transportation cost.In our International segment, reported net sales were approximately $223 million for the quarter, up 8.9% versus the prior year.

It was funded with a one-year term loan at a rate of three month LIBOR plus 75 basis points. Given the timing of this contribution, we deducted this payment on our fiscal 2017 tax return at the old rate, reducing cash taxes by approximately $105 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.
