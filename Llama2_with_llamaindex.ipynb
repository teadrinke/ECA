In the third quarter, we delivered strong top-line growth, comparable operating margin expansion, and earnings per-share growth. Our strategy is working. These results continue our track record of consistent delivery., Strong top-line growth, Comparable operating margin expansion, Earnings per-share\\ngrowth, Strategy working, Consistent delivery, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And given our year-to-date performance, we are raising both our top-line and bottom-line guidance. This morning, I\\'ll provide a brief update on the global consumer landscape, then I\\'ll focus much of my time on business performance across the segments and discuss how we\\'ve been investing to further strengthen our capabilities to capture longer-term growth opportunities. John will end by discussing financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for full year 2023, and some early considerations for 2024. The global operating environment is always dynamic, and this quarter was no exception., Raising guidance, Global consumer landscape, Business performance, Investing in\\ncapabilities, Financial details, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Some markets improved sequentially, while others dealt with a variety of factors, ranging from transitory weather conditions, ongoing inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and conflicts. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth this quarter, driven by positive volume, some pricing actions in the marketplace, and carryover pricing coming into the base from last year. Volume grew 2% and sequentially improved each month in the quarter with September being our strongest month. Our year-to-date volume growth remains consistent with underlying performance compared to 2019., Market performance, Revenue growth, Volume growth,\\nGeopolitical tensions, Inflationary pressures, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And overall, our industry remains vibrant and is expanding, and we are executing to capture that growth. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. Consumer sentiment continues to vary around the world. In developed markets, consumer spending in aggregate has held up quite well., Industry growth, Volume and value share, Consumer sentiment, Global markets,\\nExecution, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, However, some consumers feel pressured. We\\'ve seen some shift to discount channels and switching to private label brands in a few markets and categories. The intensity of this activity was largely the same across Europe compared to the previous quarter but was less pronounced in the U.S., Australia, and Japan. In the developing and emerging markets, the picture is more mixed., Consumers feeling pressured, Shift to discount channels, Switching to private\\nlabel brands, Geographical differences, Mix in developing and emerging markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re seeing broadly consumer strength across Latin America, India, and in parts of Central and Southeast Asia. On the other hand, consumer confidence in spending has yet to fully recover in Africa and China. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities give us a distinct advantage, and we are leveraging these capabilities to ensure we have the right product in the right package in the right channel and at the right price points to meet consumers where they are. Notwithstanding the dynamics in play around the world, we have many levers to pull and continue to deliver through varying market conditions., Broad consumer strength, Execution capabilities, Market dynamics, Geographical\\ndifferences, Levers to pull, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'ll share some more details from each region. Starting with Asia Pacific. We delivered organic revenue growth, but operating income declined, primarily as a result of investing ahead of the curve to participate in longer-term opportunities and incurring additional costs from strategic portfolio rationalization. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we grew top line and profit by linking our brands to drinking occasions, coupled with strong execution., Asia Pacific, Organic revenue growth, Operating income, Strategic portfolio\\nrationalization, Linking brands to drinking occasions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Thailand, we launched Coke Kitchen, which connected consumers to influencers who share their favorite recipes with Coca-Cola. We also partnered with foodservice aggregators to drive combo meals. Campaign attracted nearly 1 million consumers, and we significantly increased the attachment rate of our beverages with meals ordered through foodservice aggregators. In Japan, we\\'re gaining volume and value share year to date., Thailand, Coke Kitchen, Foodservice aggregators, Campaign, Volume and value share, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to see strong momentum from our Coca-Cola, Georgia Coffee and I LOHAS campaigns and have stepped up execution in vending, e-commerce and community channels. However, in China, volume declined as the sparkling soft drink category is taking longer to recover. Our results were also impacted by some strategic conditions that deprioritize lower-profit categories. Our focus is to restore momentum to the sparkling soft drink category and capitalize on revenue growth management and execution opportunities., Campaigns, Execution in vending, e-commerce and community\\nchannels, Volume decline in China, Strategic conditions, Restoring momentum, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In India, we delivered double-digit volume and top-line growth, which resulted in the highest value share gain over the past three years. We\\'re winning in the marketplace by generating 2.6 billion transactions at affordable price points and driving availability across rural regions. Across Asia Pacific, as part of our World Without Waste strategy to help drive a circular economy for packaging materials, our system launched 100% recycled PET packaging in India, Indonesia, and Thailand. Moving on to EMEA., India, Volume and top-line growth, Marketplace win, World Without Waste strategy,\\nCircular economy, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We delivered strong organic revenue and operating income growth. In Africa, macro conditions remain challenging, and our business was further impacted by natural disasters in Morocco and Libya. Despite this environment, we drove transaction growth through accelerated refillable PET expansion, digitizing nearly 100,000 outlets and adding 80,000 coolers year to date. In Europe, consumers are still facing pressure, and our business was unfavorably impacted by cool weather., Strong organic revenue and operating income growth, Macro conditions in Africa,\\nNatural disasters in Morocco and Libya, Transaction growth through refillable PET expansion,\\nDigitizing outlets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Despite these dynamics, we gained value share through strong performances in sparkling soft drinks and tea. We did this by partnering with our system to drive value for key customers and our consumers. We continue to see promising early results for Jack Daniel\\'s and Coca-Cola in Europe. We are learning and expanding in our core, including our recent announcement of our Absolut Vodka and Sprite., Strong performances in sparkling soft drinks and tea, Partnering with system to\\ndrive value for key customers and consumers, Early results for Jack Daniel\\'s and Coca-Cola in\\nEurope, Expanding core brands including Absolut Vodka and Sprite, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And last, in Eurasia and Middle East, we recruited consumers through innovative, occasion-based marketing events like Fanta Fest Turkiye, which focused on snacking occasions with concerts by prominent local artists. They also launched 100% recycled PET package this summer. In North America, we generated strong organic revenue growth and delivered margin expansion by executing across our total beverage portfolio. We continue to see away-from-home channels outperform at-home channels., Innovative marketing events, Fanta Fest Turkiye, Recycled PET package, Strong\\norganic revenue growth, Margin expansion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Within sparkling soft drinks, elasticities are holding up well, and we continue to drive quality leadership with Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta. For example, our systems stepped up in-store activation on Sprite Lymonade legacy with increased displays at point of sale, which drove higher household penetration and repeat purchases. Fanta drove nearly 2 points of vale share gain year to date through innovations and new graphics, including the latest Halloween iteration of the WhatTheFanta platform. Outside sparkling, Bodyarmor and Powerade trends are stabilizing., Sparkling soft drinks, Elasticities, Quality leadership, In-store activation,\\nHalloween iteration, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And fairlife, Core Power, smartwater, and Gold Peak generated value share gain. And in the U.S., to protect water resources, we renewed a decade-long partnership with the Department of Agriculture to restore and improve watersheds in national forests and grasslands. Water is a critical priority for our system and the communities that we serve. In Latin America, we generated double-digit top-line and profit growth by executing on all facets of our strategy, which resulted in value share gains in four of our top five markets., Fairlife, Core Power, smartwater, Gold Peak, Value share gain, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the fifth market, Mexico, we\\'re seeing improving value share trends over the last few months. We\\'re increasingly linking our brands to consumers\\' passion points to build deeper connections. In Brazil, through Coke Studio, we partnered with the town music festival, where we hosted 60 hours of concert and engaged with artists and influencers, which generated 1 billion impressions and reached nearly 50 million consumers. We continue to drive affordability through refillable packaging of larger PET packages., Improving value share trends, Linking brands to consumers\\' passion points, Coke\\nStudio partnership, Affordability through refillable packaging, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In developing and emerging markets, refillables are an important tool, both to eliminate waste and offer products at lower price points. Last, our systems stepped up availability, replacing over 270,000 coolers year to date, which increased our share of visible inventory in [Inaudible]. Global ventures generated strong overall growth. At Costa, we strengthened our revenue growth management equation while driving transactions growth., Refillables, Eliminating waste, Offering products at lower price points, Strong\\noverall growth, Revenue growth management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This was supported by strong innovation and marketing campaigns, such as our global Summer of Ice, expansion of the refreshment category, and the introduction of our personalized [Inaudible] drop loyalty activation in the U.K. Additionally, Innocent gained value share in both the U.K. and France. Finally, Bottling Investment Group grew organic revenue and operating income through expanding affordable immediate consumption entry packs and progressing for strengthening route to market and optimizing trade promotions., Strong innovation, Summer of Ice, Refreshment category expansion, Personalized\\ndrop loyalty activation, Bottling Investment Group growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, At the same time, we\\'re working toward decarbonizing our operations in India through using 200 electric vehicles with plans to add more before the end of 2023. Beyond the quarter, we continue to have confidence in the long term. We see momentum continuing across our industry, and our system is galvanized more than ever to capture this opportunity.

Starting first with marketing and innovation. Our marketing transformation is increasingly making our brands more relevant to consumers. Today, Gen Z spends seven to nine hours per day on screens., Marketing transformation, Relevance to consumers, Screen time, Digital\\ninitiatives, Strategy, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, However, very little time is spent watching traditional TV. We\\'ve been shifting our media spend toward digital. In 2019, digital was less than 30% of our total media spend and year to date is over 60%. Through digital campaigns with segmenting the population that\\'s disproportionately reaching consumer where we earned higher return on investments., Traditional TV viewing, Shifting media spend to digital, Digital campaigns,\\nSegmentation for higher ROI, Consumer reach, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve seen tremendous engagement through digital-first campaigns for Coke with meals, Sprite Heat Happens, and Fuzetea\\'s Made of Fusion, among others. We\\'re taking bold steps to be at the forefront of both consumer and nonconsumer-facing generative AI. For example, we launched Create Real Magic, which turn consumers into digital creators. We also brought gen AI into our creative process for the award-winning Coca-Cola Masterpiece film and later gave fans the chance to collect a piece of this work through the sale of NFTs., Digital-first campaigns, Generative AI, Consumer-facing AI,\\nCreative process, NFT sales, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Recently, we launched Coke Y3000, which is our eighth iteration in the Coke Creations platform. Coca-Cola Y3000, the world\\'s first futuristic flavor co-created with AI. The launch has demonstrated strong initial results. On the nonconsumer-facing side, we implemented generative AI to improve access to insights, market data, research, and trends., Coke Y3000 launch, Futuristic flavor co-created with AI, Strong initial results,\\nGenerative AI for access to insights, Nonconsumer-facing side, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Moving on to revenue growth management and integrated execution. As a system, we\\'re accelerating eB2B platforms that allow for better tailoring of product, price, and packaging architecture, reducing out of stocks, and optimizing placement of physical inventory. Year to date, we\\'ve connected 6.9 million customers to eB2B platforms. We continue to expand coverage and offer customers personalization at scale., Revenue growth management, Integrated execution, eB2B platforms, Customer\\npersonalization, Inventory optimization, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Initial pilot suggests that customers who receive AI-written push notifications and be more likely to purchase recommended SKUs, resulting in incremental retail sales. And we\\'re just scratching the surface of what\\'s possible, but we\\'re investing in digital capabilities now to expand our potential down the road. To sum it all up, we\\'re encouraged by our results year to date, and this is reflected in our updated 2023 guidance. We have many levers to pull and have proven that we can deliver in many types of markets around the world., AI-written push notifications, Incremental retail sales, Updated 2023 guidance,\\nProven delivery in various markets, Encouraging results year to date, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to win on a local level, maintain flexibility on a global level, and reinvest to build our system for the long term. With that, I\\'ll turn the call over to John., Winning on local level, Maintaining flexibility on global level, Reinvesting for\\nlong-term system building, Turning over to John, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\\'ll comment on our third quarter performance and highlight our updated 2023 guidance. I\\'ll also provide some early commentary on 2024 and the actions we are taking to continue to deliver on our objectives. As James mentioned, we delivered strong third quarter results., Third quarter performance, Updated 2023 guidance, Early commentary on 2024,\\nDelivery of objectives, Strong results, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Starting with the top line. We grew organic revenues 11%. Unit case growth was 2%. If you exclude the impact of suspending our business in Russia, we have delivered positive volume growth in each quarter since the start of 2021., Top line growth, Unit case growth, Positive volume growth excluding Russia,\\nSuspension of business in Russia, Quarterly delivery of positive volume growth since 2021, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Concentrate sales were in line with unit cases for the quarter. Price/mix growth was 9%, driven by pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets, along with carryover pricing, coming into the base from last year. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 20 basis points for the quarter., Concentrate sales, Unit cases, Price/mix growth, Comparable gross margin,\\nComparable operating margin, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, This was primarily driven by strong top-line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.74 was up 7% year over year despite higher-than- expected 4% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $7.9 billion year to date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by $720 million transition tax payment and $230 million in M&A-related payments., Strong top-line growth, Impact of refranchising bottling operations, Increase in\\nmarketing investments, Currency headwinds, Comparable EPS and free cash flow, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Our balance sheet is strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.5 times EBITDA is below our target range of two to 2.5 times. Recently, we entered into a letter of intent to refranchise our Philippines bottler. As we progress on our refranchising journey, we aspire to improve the return profile of our business. In 2015, when Bottling Investments Group was more than 50% of our net revenue, our return on invested capital was approximately 17%., Strong balance sheet, Net debt leverage, Refranchising journey, Return profile of\\nbusiness, ROIC in 2015, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Today, Bottling Investments Group makes up less than 20% of net revenue, and our return on invested capital is over 23%, nearly a 7-point increase. After this transaction closes, our remaining assets in the Bottling Investments Group will include operations in India, Africa, and several smaller locations, primarily in Asia Pacific. We will remain disciplined in our refranchising approach by making sure we best position our system to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our business performance year to date gives us confidence that we can deliver on our raised 2023 guidance., Today\\'s Bottling Investments Group revenue share, Return on invested capital, Remaining\\nassets in Bottling Investments Group, Refranchising approach, 2023 guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 10% to 11%, which will be led by price/mix and includes positive volume growth. We do expect pricing in developed markets to moderate in the fourth quarter as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. There are also a few hyperinflationary markets that will continue to drive price/mix. There will be one additional day in the fourth quarter., Organic revenue growth, Price/mix growth, Positive volume growth, Pricing initiatives,\\nHyperinflationary markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, We now expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per-share growth of 13% to 14%. And based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect currency to be an approximate 4-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 6-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We now expect our underlying effective tax rate for 2023 to be 19%., Comparable earnings per-share growth, Currency headwind,\\nPer-case commodity price inflation, Underlying effective tax rate, Full year 2023 expectations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, All in, we are updating comparable earnings per-share growth of 7% to 8% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations. That\\'s approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. This guidance does not include any payments related to our U.S., Comparable earnings per-share growth, Free cash flow, Cash from operations, Capital\\ninvestments, 2023 guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, income tax dispute with the IRS which are unlikely to occur in 2023. Given the momentum of our business, the strength of our balance sheet and some proceeds that we expect to receive from bottler refranchising, we have increased flexibility to continue to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareowners. While it is too early to provide specific items on 2024, we want to share some considerations based on what we know today. We\\'re encouraged by our top-line momentum across the majority of our markets., Income tax dispute, Business momentum, Balance sheet strength, Proceeds from\\nbottler refranchising, 2024 considerations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, There are a handful of hyperinflationary markets where it is either not possible to hedge or it\\'s costly to do so. In these markets, we\\'ve demonstrated that we can manage currency pressures by taking price with local market inflation, and we will continue to follow this approach. While some commodities are normalizing, we also have input costs that could be impacted by tensions and conflicts. With respect to advertising spend, our bias is to continue to reinvest behind our brands while maintaining flexibility., Hyperinflationary markets, Currency management, Input costs, Advertising spend, Brand\\nreinvestment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Regarding currency, if we assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be an approximate low single-digit currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate mid-single-digit currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Of course, several factors could impact both our currency outlook and broader business outlook between now and February. Over the past few years, we\\'ve delivered U.S. dollar EPS growth, and we have many levers to continue to do so., Currency headwind, Full year 2024 expectations, Business outlook, U.S. dollar EPS growth,\\nLevers for growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 3, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, So in summary, we are encouraged by our business results and confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments over the long term. Thanks to the incredible commitment of our system employees around the world, we\\'re very clear on the direction we are heading and well equipped to execute on the strategies to get us there, and we continue to invest to drive sustainable long-term growth. We remain focused on capturing the opportunities available to us. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions., Business results, Long-term commitments, Strategies for growth, Investment, Opportunities\\navailable, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. After a strong start to the year, we continued our momentum in the second quarter. Our combination of strong, loved brands and an aligned pervasive distribution system is allowing us to win in many different operating environments. Given our strong first-half results and the resilience of our business, we are raising both our top-line and bottom-line guidance today., Strong start to the year, Momentum in the second quarter, Strong brands, Aligned\\ndistribution system, Top-line and bottom-line guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, To give you the full picture of our results and our raised guidance, I\\'ll start by discussing second-quarter performance and provide perspective on the current business and consumer environment. Then I\\'ll highlight our performance across categories, including how we are driving quality leadership throughout our portfolio. Finally, I\\'ll touch on why we\\'re confident in our ability to deliver our long-term objectives. And then, John will end by discussing our results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2023., Second-quarter performance, Current business and consumer environment, Portfolio\\nperformance, Long-term objectives, Quarterly results and revised guidance for 2023, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the second quarter, competing macro forces were at play across our markets. On the positive side, many supply chain pressures eased, concerns surrounding the stability of the banking sector diminished, and energy prices continue to pull back from record highs. However, global inflation was still elevated, and geopolitical tensions continue to exist in some markets. Despite this confluence of factors, we delivered 11% organic revenue growth in this quarter., Second quarter performance, Macro forces, Supply chain pressures, Geopolitical tensions,\\nOrganic revenue growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Volume was flat, and after a slower start, it sequentially improved with June being our strongest month in the quarter. In the first half of 2023, we delivered volume growth that was consistent with our underlying performance since 2019. More broadly, our industry is strong, and we believe we have significant headroom to grow both volume and value. And we continue to gain share., Volume growth, First half of 2023 performance, Industry strength, Share gain, Sequential\\nimprovement, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, During the quarter, we gained value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. As we look toward the second half, the global inflationary environment is impacting consumers and our business differently across geographies. In developed markets like North America and Western Europe, inflation is beginning to moderate, and labor markets remain strong. Our elasticities continue to be relatively low., Value share gain, Global inflationary environment, Consumer impact, Elasticities, Second\\nhalf outlook, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, However, we have seen some willingness to switch to private label brands in certain categories.Across the sector, consumers are increasingly cost-conscious. They\\'re looking for value and stocking up on items on sale. In these markets, our pricing is largely in place and is expected to moderate as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. It\\'s more important than ever to be consumer-centric and to partner with customers to provide affordable and premium propositions, which deliver value through basket and incidence growth., Consumer behavior, Cost-consciousness, Private label brands, Pricing, Consumer-centric\\napproach, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In many developing and emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, consumers are more accustomed to persistent inflation. However, the number of markets with intense inflation has expanded. Five of our top 40 markets are currently experiencing over 20% annual inflation. In these markets, it\\'s equally important to leverage revenue growth management capabilities to balance affordability with premiumization to be able to take price with local market inflation, which helps offset the currency pressures., Inflation in developing and emerging markets, Persistent inflation, Currency\\npressures, Revenue growth management capabilities, Balancing affordability and premiumization, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, There are, as always, a few markets affected by specific local factors. In China, economic recovery slowed in the second quarter, and inflation has declined. Consumer confidence is below pre-pandemic levels, and we continue to monitor our leading consumer indicators and take action to win in the market. In India, business was unfavorably impacted by unseasonable rain and cooler temperatures in the quarter., China economic recovery, Inflation decline, Consumer confidence, Leading consumer\\nindicators, Market impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, However, the growth outlook remains intact. In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics from inflation to currency devaluation to shifting consumer needs, our business is proving to be very resilient. We have many levers to pull to manage successfully through different operating environments, and we remain consumer-centric and focused on growth. Our recipe for success is unchanged., Growth outlook, Market dynamics, Consumer needs, Operating environments, Consumer-centric\\napproach, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to deliver on our strategy through a combination of world-class marketing and innovation, excellence in revenue growth management, and strong execution.

A great example is our Recipe for Magic, which was activated in more than 50 markets and celebrates consuming Coca-Cola with meals. The campaign was supported by experiences using local chefs, leveraging approximately 750 influencers globally and was brought to life through social media and recipe-focused billboards. The Coke and Meals campaign also allowed Coca-Cola to strengthen its local relevance., Coca-Cola marketing, Consumption occasions, Local experiences, Influencer marketing,\\nLocal relevance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, For instance, in the away-from-home channel in Italy, Coca-Cola has grown incidence with pizza, the No. 1 consumed meal with approximately 3 billion pizzas each year, from 10% to 20% over the past four years. While the Coca-Cola brand is ubiquitous, we tailor our price pack architecture to consumption occasions and are continuing to drive both affordability and premiumization. During the second quarter, we grew basket incidents and volume per trip by double digits while increasing price per liter., Coca-Cola marketing, Italy away-from-home channel, Pizza consumption, Price pack\\narchitecture, Affordability and premiumization, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Moving on to sparkling flavors. We are seeing strong engagement from consumers across our staple of brands, which include Sprite, Fanta, FRESCA and Thums Up. At the same time, we have significant headroom to drive further quality leadership across developed and developing markets. With Sprite, we are driving brand awareness by connecting consumers to passion points and personalized experience at a more granular and locally relevant levels through our global heat happens platform., Sprite marketing, Fanta marketing, FRESCA marketing, Thums Up marketing, Quality\\nleadership, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In North America, Sprite celebrated hip-hop\\'s 50th anniversary with the launch of Sprite Lymonade Legacy and sponsorship of concept tours, exclusive experiences, and collaborations with prominent artists. We partnered with local pop stars and a Grammy producer in China using our global Sprite Limelight music program for Gen Z drinkers across 1,500 college locations. In South Korea, the Sprite Waterbomb Festival similarly generated strong results. In India, the Joke in a Bottle promotion allowed consumers to scan packages and receive customized and localized jokes through WhatsApp to beat the heat., Sprite marketing, North America, China, South Korea, India, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In June, Sprite was awarded most resilient brand by Kantar for adding the greatest number of new households in 2022 of any FMCG brand. Turning to water, sports, coffee, and tea. We are segmenting the broader opportunities and using our refreshed resource allocation capabilities, prioritized markets, and subcategories that offer the highest return on our investment.

Early results show promising velocities, and Fuze Tea grew volume double digits during the quarter. vitaminwater is another example. During the quarter, we relaunched vitaminwater zero in North America with a new sweetness system of monk fruit and stevia, which generated value share gains., Fuze Tea marketing, Green Tea Mexico, Summer limited edition, Turkey, Volume growth, vitaminwater\\nmarketing, North America, New sweetness system, Value share gains, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are capitalizing on consumer needs for rapid hydration, a fast-growing subsegment within sports drinks, with the launch of BODYARMOR FLASH I.V. in the U.S. and Flashlyte in Mexico. While still early, both saw strong consumer interest during the quarter and have demonstrated promising initial results., BODYARMOR FLASH I.V., Flashlyte, Rapid hydration, Sports drinks, Consumer interest, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our juice, value-added dairy, and plant-based beverages have delivered nine consecutive quarters of double-digit top-line growth and gained both volume and value share during the quarter. We continue to innovate and drive premiumization under the Simply trademark. Simply mixology, which provides consumers with great tasting mixes and ready-to-drink mocktails, kicked off an experiential campaign that celebrated the start of the summer in its national rollout. Also, fairlife had another exceptional quarter as both Core Power and fairlife nutrition plan continued their strong momentum., Double-digit growth, Top-line growth, Premiumization, Simply mixology, Fairlife, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In May, we announced a $650 million investment to build a state-of-the-art production facility to help drive the next wave of growth. Finally, we are encouraged by what we are seeing across alcohol ready-to-drink beverages. We continue to take a measured approach through exploring and applying our learnings. While still early, Jack and Coke has shown promising results., Investment, Production facility, Growth, Alcohol ready-to-drink beverages, Jack and Coke, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the Philippines, the combination of Jack and Coke and Lemon-Dou delivered strong share gains. The Schweppes Mojito rollout in India is also off to a good start. And these examples illustrate how our marketing transformation is coming to life. The strength of our total beverage portfolio gives us further confidence that we can continue to deliver by providing consumers beverage choices for every occasion., Jack and Coke, Lemon-Dou, Schweppes Mojito, Marketing transformation, Total beverage portfolio, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference, and we remain committed to building a more sustainable future for our company and the planet as we strive to grow our business. We continue to pursue progress toward our vision of a circular economy for packaging through innovation and partnerships. For example, in the U.S., we recently partnered with Republic Services to ensure we have an adequate supply of recycled plastic for our packaging. At the same time, we are embracing refillables., Purpose, Sustainability, Circular economy, Innovation, Refillables, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We recently kicked off a program with customers in four U.S. cities to test repeatable fountain cups with plans to expand elsewhere. We successfully navigated the first half of the year, which supports our decision to raise guidance for the full year. And instead of trying to predict the many directions things could take, we remain focused on delivering our key objectives that we outlined in February., Program, Repeatable fountain cups, Guidance, Key objectives, Focus, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In other words, number one, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer-centricity to drive top-line momentum; two, investing for the long-term health of our business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel; and three, generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. Our system has never been stronger, and our global network model is allowing us to quickly adapt to changing environments. We believe we are well positioned to deliver our updated guidance and objectives, thanks to our incredible system and employees around the world., Pursuing excellence, Investing for long-term health, Generating U.S. dollar EPS\\ngrowth, Strong system, Global network model, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the momentum of our business and our strong second-quarter results. Starting with the top line. We grew organic revenues 11%., Momentum, Strong results, Organic revenues, Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Unit cases were flat. As James said, volume for the second quarter got off to a slower start but ended on a positive note. Concentrate sales were one point ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of concentrate shipments. Price/mix growth was 10% for the quarter, driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year along with some new pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of hyperinflationary markets., Unit cases, Volume, Concentrate sales, Price/mix growth, Hyperinflationary markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 40 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 90 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top-line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments and higher operating costs versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, second-quarter comparable EPS of $0.78 was up 11% year over year despite a higher-than-expected 6% currency headwinds., Comparable gross margin, Comparable operating margin, Second-quarter comparable EPS, Currency\\nheadwinds, Marketing investments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Free cash flow was approximately $4 billion year to date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by a $720 million transition tax payment that was made during the second quarter, as well as M&A-related payments. Our balance sheet is strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.6 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to invest to drive long-term growth., Free cash flow, Working capital benefits, Transition tax payment, Balance sheet, Capital allocation\\npriorities, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, As James mentioned, we are encouraged by what we are seeing in the marketplace. While we continue to spin our strategic flywheel faster to generate top-line-led growth, we have also progressed on our margin agenda as demonstrated by our consistent track record of offsetting cost headwinds to sustain steady gross margins. We have numerous levers available to drive top-line growth and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our spend over the long term. Our all-weather strategy, coupled with the great plans that we have in place to continue to create quality leadership across our portfolio, give us good visibility to deliver on our raised 2023 guidance., Encouraging marketplace, Strategic flywheel, Gross margins, Top-line growth, All-weather strategy, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% which includes positive volume growth while continuing to be led by price/mix. There are a few considerations to keep in mind. We expect pricing in developed markets to moderate through the year as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. In developing and emerging markets, we aim to take price with local market inflation., Organic revenue growth, Price/mix, Pricing initiatives, Developed markets,\\nEmerging markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, To the extent that intense inflationary markets drive elevated price/mix, the impact is oftentimes offset by currency as it is frequently difficult to hedge our exposure. Due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in the fourth quarter. We now expect comfortable currency-neutral earnings-per-share growth of 9% to 11%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are updating our currency outlook of an approximate three- to four-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate four- to five-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full-year 2023., Intense inflationary markets, Currency hedging, Reporting calendar, Currency outlook, Comparable\\nnet revenues, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Inflationary pressures are beginning to moderate in some ways, including freight rates that are favorable compared to last year. That said, several commodities that are prevalent in our basket, like sugar and juice, remain elevated. And we have some hedges that we\\'ll be rolling off to less favorable rates. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023., Inflationary pressures, Freight rates, Commodity prices, Cost of goods sold, Hedge positions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, Our updated underlying effective tax rate for 2023 is now 19.3%. All in, we are updating comparable earnings-per-share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. If you exclude the transition tax payments made in the second quarter and various payments associated with M&A transactions, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance., Underlying effective tax rate, Comparable earnings-per-share growth, Free cash flow, Capital\\ninvestments, Long-term guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing U.S. income tax dispute with the IRS. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to build a culture that emphasizes raising the bar in every aspect of how we do business. Thanks to the tremendous ongoing commitment of our system employees around the world, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for 2023 and drive value for our stakeholders over the long term., Guidance, U.S. income tax dispute, Culture, System employees, Stakeholders, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2023, 2, John Murphy, President and Chief Financial Officer, With that, operator, we are ready to take questions., Guidance, U.S. income tax dispute, Culture, System employees, Stakeholders, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a strong year for us. We executed well and grew amid a challenging macro environment. We did this in part by focusing on expanding the sphere of what we can control., 2022, execution, growth, macro environment, control, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We delivered on our top-line and bottom-line guidance, and we continue to create value by investing in our loved brands, even as we face a very dynamic backdrop. Today, I\\'ll reflect on our fourth quarter and the year\\'s performance and set the stage for 2023. I\\'ll also share how we\\'re operating differently today, which makes us confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 guidance and well equipped for a future that continues to be volatile and uncertain. John will then discuss our results and our 2023 outlook in more detail., Delivery, Guidance, Value creation, Operating differently, Uncertainty, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, During the fourth quarter, the environment remained dynamic as inflation, geopolitical tensions, pandemic-related mobility restrictions, and currency volatility persisted. Despite this range of factors, consumer demand held up relatively well, and our industry remained strong. In the fourth quarter, we remain focused on our growth strategy and continue to create value for our consumers and customers. We maintained agility to navigate this challenging environment and delivered 15% organic revenue growth in the quarter with strong growth across operating segments., Dynamic environment, Consumer demand, Growth strategy, Agility, Organic revenue growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This was driven by pricing actions across markets and revenue growth management initiatives to retain and add consumers. While we saw robust volume growth across many markets, this was more than offset by the suspension of our business in Russia and the impact on consumption driven by varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions and the surge in COVID cases in China. Overall, throughout 2022, we have maintained consistent volume growth relative to 2019. We gained both volume and value share for the consolidated business for both the quarter and the year., Pricing actions, Revenue growth management, Volume growth, Russia suspension, Pandemic-related\\nmobility restrictions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, So far, in 2023, the volume growth trends versus 2019 are in line with last year, and we are laser-focused on executing on our growth plans. Our streamlined portfolio of global and local brands and stepped-up consumer-facing investments continue to fuel the competitive edge of the Coca-Cola system to deliver value in any environment. Our networked organizational structure enables this strategy. We connected our operating units, our functions, and our platform services organization with strong end-to-end coordination, which helps us identify key opportunities for meaningful long-term growth., 2023 volume growth, Growth plans, Portfolio of brands, Consumer-facing investments,\\nNetworked organizational structure, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And on top of this, we remain well aligned with our bottling partners, which further builds on our strengths as a networked system. As we look to 2023, many uncertainties remain in the macroeconomy, whether from economic policies, consumer demand, inflation, supply chain, war, and geopolitics. Instead of trying to forecast and predict the many directions things could move, we are focused on delivering on our key objectives: firstly, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to continue the top-line momentum; secondly, investing for the long-term health of the business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel; thirdly, generating U.S. dollar EPS growth to deliver value for our shareholders., 2023 uncertainty, Macroeconomy, Consumer centricity, Top-line momentum, EPS growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to build the right capabilities and strengthen the system alignment, delivering a dynamic world. And we continue to invest to raise the bar. We are executing more efficiently and effectively on a local level while maintaining flexibility on a global level. Throughout 2022, we saw many examples of harnessing our enhanced capabilities to win locally., Building capabilities, System alignment, Investment, Execution efficiency, Winning\\nlocally, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our new marketing model is working with linked occasions and passion points to drive engagement.

We are tying our beverages to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences., Marketing model, Linked occasions, Passion points, Consumer connections, Local experiences, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, For example, in Vietnam, to support the reopening of away-from-home accounts, we launched the pilot of Coke is Cooking campaign in October. In this month-long campaign to help drive traffic back to stores, we partnered with more than 700 food shops. We created thousands of food and Coke combo deals that consumers purchased at these food shops, along with Coke is Cooking merchandising and digital support by local influencers. This was the first time we used an on-ground event as a commercial asset, creating a social and digital content generator., Coke is Cooking campaign, Vietnam, On-ground event, Social and digital content, Influencers, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The campaign resulted in more than 1 million combo transactions and 20% uplift for participating merchants. We are leveraging passion points locally to create immersive experiences and drive consumption. For example, in Latin America, our live music strategy created memorable in-person and digital experiences, elevating consumer engagement. We partnered with Rock in Rio, one of the biggest music festivals in the world, and created new opportunities for consumers to access content through livestreams and in the metaverse., Campaign results, Passion points, Immersive experiences, Latin America, Live music strategy, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As a result, we boosted our reach for approximately 700,000 attendees to more than 45 million consumers across the region, and our sales inside the festival increased 23% versus the last festival. In India, the Thums Up Stump Cam was a never-before-seen activation for cricket fans where consumers could scan a QR code on product label and get access to exclusive match moments of the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup through a camera installed on one of the wickets. Throughout the 45-day tournament, we used first-party data and artificial intelligence to send personalized content to consumers based on their favorite matches, and we amplified the experience through sports influencers. This campaign showed strong results with Thums Up growing volume ahead of our total sparkling portfolio in India during the activation period, contributing to strong volume growth for Thums Up for the full year., Reach, Sales, Thums Up Stump Cam, Personalized content, Sports influencers, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This drove about one quarter of India\\'s total volume growth of the year. Thums Up also experienced its highest monthly market share jump during the activation period. We are driving consumer interests of action through digital experiences using the power of partnerships across platforms. For example, in Germany, we partnered with our key online customer and created voice-based branded experiences with its voice assistant to drive engagement and grow positive brand perception., Driving volume growth, India, Digital experiences, Partnerships, Positive brand\\nperception, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This allowed consumers to learn more about Coca-Cola products and shop on voice assistant-enabled devices using only their voice. The campaign delivered strong results with a reach of 11 million impressions. Additionally, consumers engaged with this voice-based experience had a 25% add-to-cart rate. And lastly, we\\'re delivering new and unexpected innovation by leveraging Gen Z insights., Voice-based branded experiences, Reach, Impressions, Add-to-cart rate, Gen Z\\ninsights, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the U.S., we launched Minute Maid Aguas Frescas. The product is made with real fruit juices, is non-carbonated, and comes in three exciting flavors. It was originally available as a limited launch in 16-ounce ready-to-drink cans. A disruptive end-to-end digital media marketing campaign created early momentum, which led us to quickly scale this experiment to our Freestyle platform and other fountain offerings., Minute Maid Aguas Frescas, Real fruit juices, Non-carbonated, Limited launch,\\nDigital media marketing campaign, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In 2022, the product had a 60% repeat rate and won the Best New Product Award from Convenience Store News. We have been building our revenue growth management and execution capabilities for many years, and we\\'ve made good progress, as shown by our ability to offset much of the inflation we saw in 2022, and deliver strong volume and transaction growth. There is still much work to be done to maximize revenue by further segmenting our markets and consumers based on additional variables. We are leveraging digital and data-backed insights to better understand our consumers., Revenue growth management, Execution capabilities, Inflation\\noffset, Market segmentation, Consumer understanding, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This will help drive affordable propositions for basket incidence growth and recruit new drinkers. It will also lead to premiumization to drive price and mix. For example, in Europe, we grew both volume and value share for the last year. We partnered with key customers to drive growth through affordability and premiumization initiatives that tapped into the key consumption occasions of meals and breaks., Affordable propositions, Basket incidence growth, Drinkers recruitment,\\nPremiumization, Key consumption occasions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This end-to-end execution resulted in higher basket incidence and buying households across all key channels in Europe. Globally, this strong system execution focus generated 80 million additional shopping trips for our products and added 17 million households to our base. Through our step-up capabilities, we are getting better at synchronizing demand creation and demand fulfillment, driving top tier value creation for our customers. We measure success by the value we create for our stakeholders and by how we are creating a better-shared future for people, communities, and the planet., End-to-end execution, Basket incidence, Buying households, Demand creation, Value\\ncreation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, During 2022, we made progress across these sustainability priorities. We leveraged our marketing power to drive growth of our low- and no-calorie beverages and continue to provide smaller package choices to enable consumers to manage sugar intake. Approximately two-thirds of the products in our portfolio have less than 100 calories per 12 ounce of serving. On packaging, we set a new industry-leading goal to have 25% of our volume globally in refillable or reusable packaging by 2030., Sustainability priorities, Low- and no-calorie beverages, Package choices,\\nIndustry-leading goal, Reusable packaging, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Additionally, we are continuing to increase school energy efficiency and the use of HFC-free coolers to make progress on our science-based targets while creating a clear roadmap with our system and suppliers to achieve our carbon emissions reduction ambition. On water, as part of our 2013 water security strategy, we stepped up investments in nature-based water solutions, exemplified by the work we\\'re doing with The Nature Conservancy and other partners. Globally, we are working to strengthen the links between replenishment projects and nature-based solutions. We further embedded sustainability into our strategy by linking diversity, equity, and inclusion performance measures to our executive annual incentive program and by linking water and our PET packaging measures to our executives\\' long-term incentive program., Carbon emissions reduction, Science-based targets, HFC-free coolers, Water\\nsecurity strategy, Nature-based solutions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Overall, we continue to focus on using our leadership and scale to drive change while delivering results and building resilience. Finally, before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that our strong results in 2022 reflect the collective efforts of our system partners and the growth mindset of our system employees. Guided by our purpose, we are investing behind our capabilities and further cultivating our growth mindset to be well positioned to create value and deliver on our objectives. While we have momentum in our business, we know uncertainty remains as we turn the page to a new year., Leadership and scale, Change driving, Results delivery, Resilience building,\\nGrowth mindset, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We will continue to focus on expanding the sphere of what we can control to drive growth in 2023 and beyond.

With that, I\\'ll turn the call over to John., Focus expansion, Growth drive, CAGNY, In-person discussion, Turnover, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we continue to drive strong top-line-led results as we executed us for growth in a dynamic operating environment. We grew organic revenues 15%. Unit cases declined 1% as broad-based growth across most markets and investments in the marketplace were more than offset by the suspension of business in Russia and a decline in China., Strong results, Top-line growth, Organic revenues, Unit cases, Market investments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Concentrate sales were three points ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by one additional day on the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price/mix growth of 12% was driven by pricing actions across operating segments, along with revenue growth management initiatives and favorable channel and package mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, mainly driven by currency headwinds in the volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating BODYARMOR finished goods business. Underlying gross margin was in line with the prior year, driven by strong organic revenue growth, offset by higher commodity costs., Concentrate sales, Price/mix growth, Comparable gross margin, Currency headwinds,\\nCommodity costs, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We continued to significantly accelerate our marketing investments to engage and retain existing consumers, as well as gain new consumers. Despite higher costs across the P&L, increased marketing, and currency headwinds, comparable operating margin expanded 65 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by underlying operating margin expansion due to robust top-line growth across operating segments. Importantly, this resulted in a full year of comfortable operating margin being in line with the prior year, despite significant currency acquisitions and cost headwinds., Marketing investments, Comparable operating margin, Currency headwinds, Costs,\\nTop-line growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Below the line, we were impacted by higher net interest expense, along with lower other income due to cycling higher pension income from the prior year. Therefore, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.45 was in line with last year despite higher-than-expected currency headwinds. This resulted in full year comparable EPS of $2.48, an increase of 7% versus the prior year, driven by strong underlying business performance, partially offset by 10 points of currency headwinds. For the year, we delivered free cash flow of $9.5 billion, a decline of 15% versus the prior year., Net interest expense, Other income, Comparable EPS, Currency headwinds, Free cash\\nflow, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Much of the decline versus our expectations occurred due to the deliberate buildup of inventory in the face of a volatile commodity environment and higher-than-anticipated tax payments. Additionally, cash flow was impacted by cycling working capital benefits from the prior year and higher incentive payments in 2022. Even with these items, our underlying cash flow generation remains strong, and we continue to make progress on our cash flow agenda. Our three-year average free cash flow conversion ratio is above 100%, ahead of our long-term target., Decline in expectations, Inventory build-up, Tax payments, Cash flow generation,\\nFree cash flow conversion ratio, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt leverage of 1.8 times EBITDA as of the end of 2022, which is below our target range of two to 2.5 times. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long-term growth, as well as delivering dividend growth for our shareholders. At the same time, we remain mindful of maintaining our financial flexibility amid the ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and are learning from the last few years of how important it is to build resilience in all of our plans. As James mentioned, in 2023, we expect the operating environment to remain dynamic., Balance sheet, Net debt leverage, Capital allocation priorities, Dividend growth,\\nFinancial flexibility, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We have the right portfolio, a very focused strategy, a flexible and adaptable structure, and a system with the ability to reinvest in the business. This gives us the confidence that we will continue to deliver on our three key objectives: pursuing excellence globally and winning locally, investing for the long-term health of the business, generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. With that in mind this morning, we provided guidance for 2023 that builds on our strong results in 2022., Portfolio, Strategy, Structure, System, Guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, primarily led by price/mix amid the ongoing inflationary environment. And we expect comparable currency neutral earnings-per-share growth of 7% to 9% versus 2022. Since we provided our initial outlook on currency in October, the currency environment has improved but remains volatile. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 2- to 3-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 3- to 4-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023., Organic revenue growth, Comparable currency neutral earnings-per-share growth,\\nCurrency headwind, Full year 2023, Initial outlook, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. And all-in, we expect comparable earnings-per-share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.48 in 2022. We expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately 11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately 1.9 billion in capital investments., Commodity price inflation, Comparable cost of goods sold, Effective tax rate,\\nComparable earnings-per-share growth, Free cash flow, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, I would like to highlight that included in the 11.4 billion of cash from operations are two discrete items: transition tax payments of approximately 720 million and scheduled increase of 335 million versus 2022, payments associated with various M&A transactions of approximately 350 million. Excluding these, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing U.S. income tax disputes with the IRS., Cash from operations, Transition tax payments, M&A transactions, Free cash flow\\nconversion, U.S. income tax disputes, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Recently, the tax court issued an opinion on a case involving a separate company. The tax court will now apply this opinion to our case and ultimately render a final decision in our case, allowing us to move forward with the appeals process. As previously discussed, we intend to assert our claims on appeal, vigorously defend our position, and believe we will ultimately prevail. Overall, we don\\'t expect this to have a bearing on our ability to deliver on our capital allocation agenda and drive long-term business growth., Tax court decision, Appeals process, Capital allocation agenda, Long-term business\\ngrowth, U.S. income tax disputes, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2023. We expect price/mix to moderate through the year as we cycle our pricing initiatives from the prior year. While the inflationary environment appears to be cooling, we are still expecting to see elevated inflation across our operating costs. We have stepped up our marketing investments for the last few years, and we will continue to invest to support momentum., Price/mix, Inflationary environment, Marketing investments, Momentum, Cycling\\npricing initiatives, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, And given the ongoing backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see higher net interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one less day in the first quarter and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Having delivered strong results in 2022, we are focused on driving a top-line-led growth equation in many types of environments. We are well positioned to deliver on guidance for 2023, thanks to the incredible people we have around the world, the strong alignment we have with our bottling partners, and the great plans we have for the coming year., Rising interest rates, Net interest expense, Reporting calendar, Top-line-led\\ngrowth equation, Guidance for 2023, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, With that, operator, we are ready to take questions., Taking questions, Readiness, Growth equation, Guidance, Reporting calendar, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. After a strong first half of the year, we continued our momentum in the third quarter with effective execution across our global system despite a macro backdrop that remains challenging. In the face of these pressures, consumers stayed resilient, and we continue to invest behind our loved brands to drive value in the marketplace and growth in our business. Given our strong results year to date, and increased visibility into the rest of the year, we are raising our top-line and bottom-line guidance, while continuing to invest strategically., Strong execution, Resilient consumers, Investment in brands, Guidance raising,\\nVisibility into rest of year, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, So this morning, I\\'ll provide a business update and discuss how we are expanding the circumference of what we can control. Then I\\'ll pass to John, and he will discuss financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for the full year 2022 and some early considerations for 2023. During the third quarter, macroeconomic crosscurrents continued to impact the operating environment. The conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, which creates challenges in that country and beyond., Business update, Expanding control, Macroeconomic crosscurrents, Conflict in\\nUkraine, Guidance and considerations for 2023, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And we saw renewed pandemic-related mobility restrictions in China. Inflationary forces are driving costs, pricing, and interest rates higher, resulting in currency volatility in many parts of the world. Against this backdrop, our industry remains healthy and is growing both in value and volume, which continues to include some benefit from cycling COVID-related impacts from the prior year. In the third quarter, we delivered strong organic revenue growth across all operating segments., Renewed pandemic restrictions, Inflationary forces, Currency volatility, Industry\\nhealth, Organic revenue growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This was driven by pricing actions and robust volume growth. We had share gains overall and across most categories, as well as within both at-home and away-from-home channels. We accomplished this by investing in our business and providing the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and add consumers. Notably, we drove revenue growth ahead of transactions growth, which is also ahead of volume growth in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our revenue growth management capabilities., Pricing actions, Volume growth, Share gains, Revenue growth management,\\nTransactions growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Consumer elasticities in core categories have continued to hold up well.

Trademark Coke delivered strong growth through effective execution and occasion-based marketing., Asia Pacific, India, Share gain, Sparkling offerings, Trademark Coke, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Year to date, we drove approximately 2.5 billion transactions at affordable price points through the expansion of returnable glass bottles and single-serve PET packages. Sprite has grown to become a $1 billion brand in the market, driven by the success of locally adapted occasion-based global marketing campaigns like Heat Happens and Screentime. In Japan, we continue to strengthen our business. Amidst an inflationary environment in the country for the first time in many years, we took price increases in large PET packages., Transactions, Affordable price points, Returnable glass bottles, Single-serve PET\\npackages, Sprite brand growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Through intelligent innovation on small packs, we\\'ve gained value share, transactions, and household penetration year to date. Additionally, we continued our strong share gains in vending in the quarter, and we expanded our leadership position in e-commerce. In China, we grew volume in the quarter and achieved strong growth in sparkling soft drinks during the summer selling season, amid varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions. We focused on digital to unlock new opportunities., Intelligent innovation, Value share, Transactions, Household penetration, Share\\ngains in vending, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We deployed Fans Festival, a drink scan wind pilot at scale, which drove widespread brand exposure and connected consumer traffic to more than 30,000 outlets. We remain focused on executing RGM strategies to drive outlet expansion and increase key SKU availability. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we saw strong volume and transaction growth across most markets, driven by new product launches and continued recovery in away-from-home channels.

We focus relentlessly on excellence in execution and reduced retail out-of-stocks. We\\'ve built sustainable customer engagement in more than 80,000 points of sale year to date through a customer loyalty partnership program. In Eurasia and the Middle East, we remain resilient amid an unprecedented inflationary environment in many markets and some supply related disruptions., Africa volume growth, Africa value share growth, Execution excellence, Retail out-\\nof-stocks reduction, Customer loyalty partnership program, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, A cross-market launch of fee for activation and the Fanta Fest campaign were in key enablers of growth. With strong focus on execution, we placed over 50,000 coolers and have gained availability in 33,000 new outlets year to date. In North America, we drove volume and value share gains through strong core sparkling performance, complemented by robust innovation and music-led experiential marketing despite intermittent supply chain challenges.

In Latin America, we leveraged connected experiences and strong execution to drive top-line growth and sequentially improve on our share losses. We strengthened our connections with Use Through Music, leveraging the Coca-Cola Marshmallow flavor to stream Rock in Rio across the continent.

In Global Ventures, we witnessed robust volume growth. However, overall cost of performance was impacted by a dynamic operating environment in the U.K., along with investments in the marketplace as we expand internationally. China ready-to-drink value share grew with the strong performance of innovations like Costa Char Tea and Oak Coffee., Alignment, growth, volume, cost, international expansion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ready-to-drink in Japan is also delivering strong performance supported by sampling in-store execution and the launch of Caramel Latte. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong volume and top-line performance driven by a focus on affordable entry-pack expansion across all markets. Additionally, we\\'re driving availability and efficiencies in cost to serve. As we look forward beyond this year, we continue to see great opportunity for our industry., Ready-to-drink, Japan, Caramel Latte, Bottling Investments Group, affordable entry-pack expansion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are allocating resources in a disciplined way to gain share. Success from our marketing model is based on two critical components: linking occasions and passion points to drive engagement, and leveraging experiments to optimize our marketing. This drives deeper connections with consumers, reaching them in new and unique ways. The launch of the Bleeding is Magic global campaign for the FIFA World Cup celebrates the passionate journey of soccer fans by unveiling a suite of digital experiences that capture the full extent of fans\\' devotion to their beloved teams., Allocating resources, marketing model, linking\\noccasions, passion points, Bleeding is Magic campaign, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The campaign includes the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour as well as a digital hub called Coca-Cola Fan Zone, which creates in-person opportunities for fans to come together to trade Panini stickers behind the Coca-Cola labels. This campaign has already led to a gain of more than 3.5 million consumers for direct engagement. Building on our digital experiments, we also announced a strategic partnership in six countries with Grab, Southeast Asia\\'s leading connected app. This builds new consumer connections and offers a new level of convenience., Campaign, FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour, Coca-Cola Fan Zone, consumer engagement,\\nstrategic partnership, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Through a mix of offline advertising on the graph fleet, online advertising in the Grab app, gamification, and product sampling, we are building more purchasing occasions to grow demand for at-home consumption. Our innovations have delivered strong results with more than 25% contribution to incremental gross profit year to date. Our innovations span markets and categories, with 55% of year-to-date innovations outside of the sparkling category. Our pipeline is robust and we are excited about their unique consumer propositions., Offline advertising, online advertising, gamification, product sampling,\\ninnovations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, For example, Coca-Cola Creations is providing bold on-trend flavors designed to build both with younger consumers.

Our innovations are designed with scalability in mind to further support our growth portfolio. We expect inflationary pressures to continue, so we are leveraging all the levers of RGM at our disposal, including price, promotional intelligence and proactive mix management.

For example, in Japan, we are seeing strong results from our segmented approach. Instead of our key 500 ml PET pack for Fanta, we now sell on smaller 350 ml PET pack on the go and one larger 700 MLP back for home occasions. This dual-pack strategy has increased beverage incidents by 9%., Drives trip conversion, value growth, segmented approach, dual-pack strategy,\\nbeverage incidents, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Q3, retail value transactions and market share were all up for these packages. Our system is investing to grow our executional footprint, adding to what was already pervasive distribution, resulting in availability of our products in nearly two-thirds of all outlets globally. These strong results are clear proof points of what is possible when our alliance system leans forward for growth. Underpinning all of this work is our purpose to Refresh the World and Make a Difference., Q3 results, retail value transactions, market share, executional footprint,\\npurpose, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sustainability remains an integral part of our business and strategy and is a key driver of future growth and business resilience. While we have made progress toward our World Without Waste goals, we remain committed to do more and faster so we can grow our business the right way. We\\'re continuing to partner with other businesses, civil society, and governments to support cooperative action on this critical issue.

In North America and Latin America, Sprite has shifted all of its PET packaging from green to clear, improving the efficiency of recycling systems and increasing the availability of food-grade RPET. In Vietnam, we launched Coca-Cola bottles made from 100% recycled plastic, excluding the cap and the label. We now have more than 30 markets where we offer at least one brand in a 100% RPET package, with similar launches planned in additional markets next year., eco-friendly bottles, recycling systems, food-grade RPET, 100% recycled plastic\\npackages, market launches, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In an operating environment that increasingly puts more variables into the equation than we\\'ve seen in the past, we are focused on delivering and executing for growth. We are encouraged by what we are seeing in the business. We are committed to expanding the circumference of what we can control by delivering world-class marketing, disciplined innovation, excellence in revenue growth management, and laser-sharp execution in the marketplace, with a goal of operating at a higher level through these challenging market conditions. We are doing this with capable and aligned bottling partners around the world., delivering growth, executing for growth, committed to expansion, world-class\\nmarketing, disciplined innovation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The combination of strong loved brands and a pervasive distribution system is a formula for resilience in times like these, and we are pleased to be raising both our top-line and bottom-line guidance today.

Today, I\\'ll comment on our third quarter performance and provide considerations for our updated guidance to this year. I\\'ll also provide some early commentary on 2023 and what actions we are taking to drive a top-line-led growth equation to navigate this dynamic environment. We are encouraged with the continued momentum of our business, and we delivered another set of strong results in the third quarter., third quarter performance, updated guidance, top-line-led growth equation, dynamic\\nenvironment, business momentum, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We grew organic revenue 16%, unit cases grew 4%, with broad-based growth across most operating segments and targeted investments in the marketplace. Concentrate sales were in line with unit cases for the quarter. Our price/mix of 12% was driven primarily by pricing actions across operating segments, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 190 basis points versus the prior year., organic revenue growth, unit cases, broad-based growth, price/mix, comparable\\ngross margin, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, The underlying margin compression was approximately 60 basis points, with the rest of the impact coming from currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating the Bodyarmor finished goods business. We significantly stepped up our consumer and customer-facing investments to support our robust marketing agenda and strong innovation pipeline. Notwithstanding higher costs and continued investments in the marketplace, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 100 basis points, driven by strong top-line growth. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 50 basis points due to the impact of the Bodyarmor acquisition and currency headwinds., underlying margin compression, currency headwinds, consumer and customer-facing\\ninvestments, robust marketing agenda, strong innovation pipeline, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Below the line, we benefited from a lower-than-expected effective tax rate for the full year. All in, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.69 grew 7% year over year, and this was impacted by 11 points of currency headwinds. On cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $7.3 billion year to date driven by our strong business performance. This was 14% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to two items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter., lower-than-expected effective tax rate, third quarter comparable EPS, currency\\nheadwinds, free cash flow, working capital benefits, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Additionally, our net debt leverage is 1.8 times EBITDA, which is slightly below our targeted range of two and two and a half times. As we look to the operating environment, there are clearly many variables at play today, as James mentioned. We are spinning our top line and bottom line flywheels faster to fortify our business and manage through many types of environments, and we\\'re investing in the marketplace to create value for our customers and consumers. Given our strong results and the visibility we have for the rest of the year, we are raising guidance for the full year., net debt leverage, EBITDA, operating environment, top-line flywheels, bottom-line\\nflywheels, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 14% to 15% and comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 15% to 16%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we expect currency to be a seven-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a nine-point headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. We now expect an underlying effective tax rate of 19% in 2022. All in, we expect comparable earnings-per-share growth of 6% to 7% versus 2021., organic revenue growth, comparable currency-neutral EPS growth, currency headwind,\\nunderlying effective tax rate, comparable earnings-per-share growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022, through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less about $1.5 million in capital investments. There are some considerations to keep in mind for Q4 that we factored into our full year guidance. There is an additional day in the fourth quarter, however, we expect concentrate sales to end the year in line with unit case sales. We are investing in consumer-facing marketing to get a fast start for next year., free cash flow, cash from operations, capital investments, concentrate sales,\\nconsumer-facing marketing, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt. The environment remains volatile, and while we are preparing for many futures in 2023, we did want to share some early considerations for next year based on what we know today. We are encouraged by the momentum in our top line and we leverage our capabilities to sustain top-line growth with the ongoing inflationary backdrop. As we look to our cost outlook, we expect global inflation to continue to impact our expenses across the board and commodities to remain volatile., rising interest rates, floating rate debt, top-line growth, global inflation,\\ncommodity volatility, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We benefited from hedges in our commodity exposure this year. And even though some of the commodities have started to come off their highs, we expect another year of elevated inflation on a per-case basis next year. We estimate the underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. Regarding currency, if we were to assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be an approximate five- to six-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues, and an approximate seven- to eight-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023., hedges in commodity exposure, elevated inflation, underlying effective tax rate,\\ncurrency headwind, comparable earnings per share, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, However, given the amount of volatility in the currency markets, this initial view could change when we come back to you for the fourth quarter call in February. We are committed to delivering top-line-led growth and we remain focused and confident in our ability to achieve our three key objectives: investing for the long-term health of the business, winning locally and generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. We are pleased with our results so far and have the visibility to deliver on our updated guidance, creating value for our shareowners through strong top-line growth, cash flow generation, and dividend growth., top-line-led growth, currency markets volatility, key objectives, U.S. dollar EPS growth,\\ncash flow generation and dividend growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Our strong system leadership and the tremendous ongoing commitment of our people around the world gives us confidence that we will continue to deliver sustainable results in the year ahead.

In the second quarter, we delivered strong performance by continuing to execute on our growth strategy. our industry remained robust, and we gained both volume and value share in the quarter. Our first half 2022 results and the resiliency of our business give us confidence to raise our top-line guidance., strong performance, growth strategy, industry robustness, top-line guidance,\\nraising guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This is offsetting the meaningful increases in costs and currency headwinds to hold our bottom line U.S. dollar outlook of 5% to 6% growth, even as we accelerate investments in our business to drive future growth. These results are enabled by our organization\\'s purpose-led culture, strong alignment with our bottling partners, and the dedication and flexibility of our people while driving our growth agenda. This morning, I\\'ll discuss the current operating environment and how we\\'re delivering results and building for the future in that environment, and the progress on our sustainability agenda., holding bottom line outlook, investments in business, purpose-led culture, strong\\nalignment with bottling partners, dedication and flexibility of people, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how we are building resilience to manage through external factors worldwide. During the second quarter, the operating environment continued to be asynchronous with many moving parts. Some regions continued to experience broad-based macro strength while others are experiencing strong inflationary pressures. Some countries are still recovering from the pandemic, while China experienced pandemic-related lockdowns., building resilience, external factors, operating environment, macro strength,\\ninflationary pressures, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And the conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, and we\\'d like to send our thoughts and deepest sympathies to all of those who continue to be affected. With this as a backdrop, we have managed well with our bottlers and delivered robust revenue growth across all our geographic segments that encompass strong pricing actions and strong volume performance helped by away-from-home recovery. Consumer elasticities have largely held a better-than-expected year to date, though we are watching closely for signs of changing consumer behavior as the year goes on and as the average cost of the consumer basket continues to go up.

We gained share in sparkling soft drinks and juices, and our system is continuing to invest in the marketplace availability and execution to capture growth.

Performance in China was under pressure, driven by COVID lockdowns. Volume was down for all months in the quarter, but the team persevered through a challenging environment, and recovery began in June as most restrictions started to lift. We focus on the core, prioritized top SKUs, and reallocated resources to digital engagement, e-commerce, and O2O as consumer demand shifted to at-home consumption., strong innovation pipeline, launch of new products, performance in China, COVID\\nlockdowns, recovery in June, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In ASEAN and South Pacific, macro fundamentals remained strong despite ongoing supply chain headwinds.

We accelerated cooler placement, reduced retail out of stocks, and continued building RGM capability across markets. In Eurasia and Middle East, amid an unprecedented inflationary environment, the industry is growing, and the recovery of the on-premise channel is driving our growth.

We\\'re gaining share in the direct-to-consumer business and now reaching approximately 6.3 million consumers via digital channels. In global ventures, the cost of retail business was under pressure as footfall in the U.K. stayed below 2019 levels., Flavored alcohol beverage business, direct-to-consumer business, digital channels,\\nretail business, U.K. footfall, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, However, the Costa Express platform remained robust, and the launch of the new Frappe Range in the U.K. drove growth. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong top-line performance, driven by a focus on recruitment through affordable entry packs, including a relaunch of returnable glass bottles in India. Additionally, we saw continued sparkling soft drink share gains versus 2019 in the Philippines and Vietnam., Costa Express platform, Frappe Range, Bottling Investments Group, affordable entry\\npacks, sparkling soft drink share gains, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, While the macro environment is still asynchronous around the world, we\\'re operating in an industry with a relatively predictable pattern of growth and attractive growth potential over the long term. So we\\'re investing in our business and are anticipating the many futures as they come at us. We have managed a broad-based recovery coming out of the pandemic. Our five-year average organic revenue growth rate is at the top end of our long-term growth target of 4% to 6%, which is a proof point of our transformed and strengthened organization., macro environment, industry growth potential, investment, pandemic recovery,\\norganic revenue growth rate, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on raising the bar on the elements of our flywheels for top-line growth and, as I said earlier, expand the circumference of what we can control, namely through building our strong portfolio of love brands, excellence in revenue growth management and the power of our system execution. We\\'re making targeted investments to unlock our growth agenda. We\\'ve built capabilities in brand building, innovation, RGM, and execution, leveraging the power of scale while still being locally relevant to consumers. These investments enable us to win not only in today\\'s environment but continue to build our business for the long term., flywheels, top-line growth, brand building, revenue growth management, execution, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our new marketing model is focused on adding and retaining consumers. And we\\'re doing this through an ecosystem of experiences that link consumption occasions with consumer passion points. The launch of the Global Magic Weekends campaign with Trademark Coke, in partnership with more than 20 food service aggregators, is showing great results. This campaign engages consumers at key moments from gaming to music to meal times., new marketing model, consumer passion points, Global Magic Weekends campaign, food\\nservice aggregators, key moments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are seeing 3.5 times redemption levels for Coca-Cola combo meals versus pre-campaign levels and a 50% lift in outlets with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar availability. With the launched end-to-end digital-first brand campaigns for Smartwater and Vitaminwater, the snackable video content on social platforms for Smartwater with global icons and [Inaudible], and the launch of Vitaminwater [Inaudible] partnership on TikTok is a different engagement approach to marketing that is already delivering strong results across channels.

We work to bring these elements to life at a local level with our bottling partners. For example, in India, we focus on segmented pricing, increasing prices on multiserves and premium packs while holding transaction-driving price points in single-serve and the affordable portfolio. Additionally, we reached our highest-ever outlet availability and drove a four-point increase in single-serve availability and a six-point increase in affordable pack availability., RGM, price and promotional intelligence, proactive mix management, premiumization,\\naffordability, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Europe, our system implemented several affordability and premiumization initiatives. We drove strong transaction and volume growth through initiatives like incentivizing multipacks to drive value on a price-per-ounce basis for consumers and driving single-serve packages like cans and returnable glass bottles in Horeca channels. By keeping transaction-driving price points in play, we expanded our consumer base with sparkling soft drinks in the region year to date. We\\'re building consumer-centric loved brands and products, and our improving excellence in execution extends the building a more sustainable future for our business and the planet., affordability, premiumization, transaction growth, volume growth, sustainability, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, During the quarter, we released our fourth World Without Waste Report, which provides an update on our ambitious sustainable packaging initiatives. It showcases how we are using our global reach and expertise to drive solutions at scale. Our operating units are further integrating sustainable practices into the business to drive growth. For example, in the United States, we are executing a set of initiatives to help solve the plastic waste problem., World Without Waste Report, sustainable packaging initiatives, sustainable\\npractices, plastic waste problem, United States, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We recently joined industry groups, including the Consumer Goods Forum and the American Beverage Association, to sort our model extended producer responsibility bill in Colorado. This is in addition to the support we provided for well-designed minimum-recycled content legislation in three states. These are now being enacted into law.

Later this month, we will expand our use of 100% recycled PET throughout the U.S. and Canada. Every part of our business understands how their actions impact the company\\'s wider sustainability goals, and we continue to make progress., bold label, recycled content, U.S., Canada, sustainability goals, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, To sum up, we are continuing to navigate a confluence of macroeconomic factors, and our networked organization is embracing the resilience to weather many environments. Guided by our purpose and with the right strategy through our portfolio and the right execution capabilities, we are confident about delivering top growth for now and the long term. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to congratulate him for assuming the role of president beginning October 1st, in addition to his current responsibility to the CFO. And of course, I also want to thank Brian Smith for his service and innumerable contributions to the system during his 25-year tenure with the company and wish him all the best for the future., macroeconomic factors, networked organization, strategy, execution capabilities,\\nleadership change, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly touch on the drivers of our second quarter performance and the update to our full year 2022 guidance, then I\\'ll provide commentary on building resilience in our business by investing behind our brands and driving top-line-led growth. We\\'re pleased with the continued momentum of our business around the world. This has translated into strong top line and comparable EPS growth, notwithstanding the larger-than-expected currency headwinds, and increased cost pressures., drivers of performance, full year guidance, resilience, brand investment, top-line\\ngrowth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We delivered organic revenue growth of 16%. Unit cases grew 8% with broad-based growth across all operating segments. Concentrate sales were behind unit cases by four points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and our Europe, Middle East, and Africa group. Our price/mix of 12% was primarily driven by strategic pricing actions across markets, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets, and positive segment mix., organic revenue growth, unit cases, concentrate sales, price/mix, strategic\\npricing actions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 250 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of three items: one, an upsized increase in costs in the business due to the inflationary environment; two, currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop; and three, the mechanical effect of consolidating the Bodyarmor finished goods business. On the marketing front, we increased our consumer and customer-facing spending to create more value for our brands and continue to earn their respective price points. Despite increased investments and costs throughout the P&L, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 40 basis points, driven by a higher return from our investments in the marketplace. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 110 basis points due to the Bodyarmor acquisition and currency headwinds., gross margin, inflationary environment, currency headwinds, marketing spending,\\nunderlying operating margin, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Putting this all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.70 grew 4% year over year. And this was impacted by nine points of currency headwinds, five points higher than what we\\'d anticipated when we last gave guidance. On cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $4.1 billion year to date, driven by our strong business performance. This was 20% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to two items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter., second quarter EPS, currency headwinds, cash flow, working capital benefits,\\nannual incentives, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Additionally, our net debt leverage is 2.1 times EBITDA, which is within the targeted range of two to 2.5 times. As we look at the operating environment and the resilience consumers have shown thus far, we are watching closely for signs that indicate this may change. We remain ready to adapt. We\\'re using a dynamic resource allocation framework to ensure our investments are directed toward country category combinations that drive the highest growth, thereby maximizing our returns., net debt leverage, EBITDA, operating environment, consumer resilience, dynamic\\nresource allocation framework, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, And we are working closely with our bottling partners to effectively navigate whatever comes our way. With this backdrop, this morning, we are raising our top line and currency-neutral EPS guidance. We now expect organic revenue growth of 12% to 13% and comparable currency-neutral earnings-per-share growth of 14% to 15% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect currency to be a six-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a nine-point headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022., raising guidance, top line growth, currency headwinds, hedge positions, full year 2022, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022. And all in, we continue to expect comparable earnings-per-share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022 that we factored into our guidance., effective tax rate, comparable earnings-per-share growth, free cash flow, capital investments,\\nconsiderations for 2022, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, While our shipments are currently behind unit cases, we expect these to run in line for the full year with the catch-up expected in the fourth quarter. We now expect that the direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspensions of business in Russia, will be approximately $0.03 to comparable EPS. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect commodity price inflation to move to a high single-digit impact from mid-single digits on comparable cost-of-goods sold in 2022. This is primarily due to commodity cost increases across our concentrate and finished goods businesses., shipments, full year, direct impact, Ukraine conflict, commodity price inflation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Other costs, including wages, transportation, media, and operating expenses, are also increasing and adding incremental pressures. The consolidation of the Bodyarmor finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins, partially offset by the impact of refranchising our Vietnam and Cambodia bottling operations. And lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our exposure to floating rate debt. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to raise the bar in every aspect of how we do business., other costs, consolidation, refranchising, interest expense, rising interest rates, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, And we feel confident in our ability to effectively navigate this dynamic global environment and deliver on our updated guidance for 2022. Along with our bottling partners, we remain focused on the compelling growth opportunity our industry offers, and we are investing and creating flexibility in the business by taking actions on those things within our control. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions., ability to navigate, growth opportunity, investing and flexibility, taking\\nactions, readiness to take questions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I\\'d like to share our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by what\\'s happening in Ukraine. The safety of our people and their families continues to be our top priority. And as we highlighted in our release this morning, we are taking actions to provide that support., safety of people, actions taken, support for affected parties, Ukraine conflict, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now this morning, I\\'ll discuss how we drove strong results in the quarter and that we are reiterating our guidance even in the face of incremental challenges. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how our work has prepared us for whatever may be around the corner. We all know that much has happened in the world since we last talked with you in February, leading, for sure, to an operating environment that is fast changing and increasingly complex. However, we remain confident about the future and are well equipped to manage external factors worldwide through our strengthened leadership position with the right portfolio, the right strategy, and the right execution in the marketplace., strong results, quarterly financial details, incremental challenges, external factors, leadership\\nposition, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, After a promising start to the year, the operating environment soon changed with very significant geopolitical conflict, a resurgence of COVID in various places, record-high inflation and continued challenges on the supply chain front. Nonetheless, we\\'ve consistently sustained our momentum from last year, moving with agility acquisitions changed to generate strong top and bottom-line growth in the quarter. We delivered 8% unit case volume growth, primarily driven by strong recovery in away-from-home channels and continued growth in at-home channels. Volume growth was strong across all operating segments, driven by marketing investments and aided by an increase in consumer mobility as the impact of the pandemic abated in most regions., geopolitical conflict, COVID resurgence, inflation, supply chain challenges, strong growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our enhanced capabilities helped us gain value share overall in both at-home and away-from-home channels globally and across most of our geographic operating segments, a clear indicator of the power of our new approach. Amidst the dynamic macro conditions and an inflationary cost backdrop, we focused on delivering growth. The key competitive edge of the Coca-Cola system continues to be rebuilded to deliver value for our consumers and our customers in any environment. Our accelerated agenda in marketing and innovation is tying our beverages to daily consumption occasions, adding and creating value for our brands., enhanced capabilities, value share, dynamic macro conditions, inflationary cost backdrop,\\ncompetitive edge, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Additionally, we continue to work with our bottling partners to expand package offerings and strengthen distribution to capture growth opportunities, using all the available revenue growth management levers, including price, to win in the marketplace. These scaled global initiatives are coming to life at a local level all around the world. So let\\'s start with Asia Pacific. In India, we drove excellence in integrated execution as consumer mobility have improved across channels by stepping up product availability, adding approximately 240,000 outlets and over 50,000 coolers., expanding package offerings, strengthening distribution, revenue growth management levers,\\nintegrated execution, consumer mobility, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We also continue to build relevance through innovation by launching Maaza Aam Panna to leverage our equity in Mango and Fanta Apple to expand our footprint in the fast-growing fruit-flavored sparkling subcategory. Japan is emerging from the extended state of emergency, and we\\'ve increased our consumer base and driven market share gains in key categories. The Coke On app reached 35 million app downloads, continuing the direct engagement with consumers to create and capture value. We also continued our focus on ESG initiatives with 100% recycled PET bottles now available in Japan for five key brands, including Coke and Georgia Coffee., relevance through innovation, Maaza Aam Panna, market share gains, ESG initiatives, Coke On app, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In China, a strong start in January, led by an excellent Chinese New Year brand activation with Coke, was followed by strict COVID lockdowns. And this resulted in reduced consumer mobility. Momentum reversed in February and March and led to a decline in unit case volume during the quarter. We\\'re moving fast to focus on core SKUs and ensure product availability., strong start, Chinese New Year brand activation, COVID lockdowns, reduced consumer mobility, focus\\non core SKUs, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re adapting how we engage with consumers depending upon local market conditions, and we\\'re working in close collaboration with our bottling partners to focus on execution basics like increasing multipack availability and maximizing share of visible inventory in channels and regions that are open. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained share in key countries and across most categories, while consumer mobility was mixed and supply chain headwinds remained. Growth was led by trademark Coke and sparkling flavors, driven by strong end-to-end execution of the Zero Words, Sprite Heat Happens and the Fanta Colorful People brand campaigns. In EMEA, notwithstanding the conflict in Ukraine and an uptick in inflation, we delivered a strong performance in Europe in the quarter., adapting consumer engagement, execution basics, share gain, supply chain headwinds, brand\\ncampaigns, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The continued rollout of new and improved Coca-Cola Zero Sugar across key markets helped drive five percentage points of sparkling single-serve mix growth, which is ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is closing the gap with the No. 1 hard seltzer brand in Europe, and the eB2B business with MyCCEP.com accounted for low double-digit contribution to total revenue. We are keeping a close watch on the spillover reflex of the conflict in Ukraine on the health of the consumer, and we remain ready to pivot and adapt., sparkling single-serve mix growth, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, eB2B business, conflict in Ukraine,\\nconsumer health, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Africa, macroeconomic recovery is underway, although conditions remained challenging due to inflationary pressure. In South Africa, we accelerated refillable PET expansion and the execution of in-store sampling to retain consumers. We are connecting with our existing customers in the digital space and have surpassed 65,000 outlets on the Wabi eB2B platform, significantly ahead of plan. Despite macro volatility and intense inflation in the region, Eurasia and Middle East drove top-line growth through a strong suite of marketing programs across categories, led by sparkling and ready-to-drink tea., macroeconomic recovery, inflationary pressure, refillable PET expansion, digital space, top-line\\ngrowth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Turkey, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar became the No. 2 immediate consumption player in value share behind brand Coke. In Pakistan, Coke Studio, a platform that unites diverse cultures through the power of music, drove social engagement that reached an all-time high in terms of impressions and viewings. In North America, we are seeing more inflation and are continuing to navigate supply chain dynamics., Turkey, Pakistan,\\nSupply Chain, Inflation, Music, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re closely monitoring further pressure in some inputs such as high fructose corn syrup, PET and metals, along with wages and transportation as they impact us as well as our bottling partners. Despite these challenges, we continue to gain share in both at-home and away-from-home channels and across most categories. The strong rollout of Real Magic platform and the successful launch of Coke Starlight resulted in Coke trademark being the fastest-growing trademark in measured retail, driving household penetration up a full point. POWERADE [Inaudible] launched during NCAA March Madness, generating more than 1 billion impressions., Inputs, Share Gain,\\nReal Magic, Coke Starlight, NCAA March Madness, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We also continued to learn from the returnable glass-bottled pilot that has been implemented in the Southwest. In Latin America, we delivered strong performance despite challenging macro conditions, and the investments we made to sustain momentum are paying off. We remain focused on integrated execution and drove revenue growth faster than transaction growth, both of which grew faster than unit case volume growth. Our work to strengthen the traditional trade is paying off as the channel showed the best underlying performance across all channels., Latin America,\\nIntegrated Execution, Traditional Trade, Revenue Growth, Macro Conditions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Prospera loyalty program added nearly 50,000 retailers in the quarter while continuing to advance our customer-focused digital expansion. Notably, we have digitized nearly 2 million customers in the region, and we are leveraging the strong system alignment with our bottling partners and are continuing to execute for growth. Within Global Ventures, despite an inflationary backdrop in the U.K., Costa continued to recover driven by retail and strong like-for-like sales with Costa Express.

Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong Q1 performance, driven by the expansion of affordable immediate consumption entry packs in key markets, and this resulted in share gains in sparkling. We also continue to make progress toward optimizing trade promotions and Costa serve in our key markets and raise the bar on operational excellence. Clearly, the operating environment is proven to be more challenging, but we\\'re pleased with the results we delivered in the first quarter., Costa Cha, Share\\nGains, Trade Promotions, Operational Excellence, Challenging Environment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to believe the recovery in 2022 will be asynchronous. We anticipate many new chapters and challenges, including, but not limited to, ongoing geopolitical conflict; uncertain consumer sentiment amid the increasingly inflationary environment; accelerated cost pressures and ongoing supply challenges; and of course, continued evolution of pandemic. That said, the changes we have made during the pandemic have left us better positioned than ever to capture growth, increasing our confidence in the future. The multiple levers of revenue growth management have never been more important, and our investments in building this capability over the past few years are giving us a clear advantage., Geopolitical\\nConflict, Inflationary Environment, Cost Pressures, Pandemic, Revenue Growth Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Further actions on pricing will depend on the consumer and inflationary environment as the year progresses, but we will continue to rely on a mix of price, package differentiation, and ever-sharper promotional strategies. Through integrated RGM and execution capabilities, we adapt to local market conditions and give consumers what they want, where they want it and at the right price. By extending package offerings to keep transaction driving price points in play, we retain consumers through affordability while also driving premiumization with innovation and targeted pricing. For example, in Latin America, we are continuing the expansion of refillables to sparkling flavors and juices, and this remains a compelling consumer proposition to address the need for affordability., Pricing Strategies,\\nIntegrated RGM, Package Differentiation, Premiumization, Affordability, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In North America, we\\'re maximizing value by initiatives like the one expanding the availability of mini cans for consumption across occasions such as breaks and meals and by offering six packs, 10 packs, and 30 packs, driving an approximate 45% increase in retail dollars in measured channels and then near 20% increase in total distribution points. Our networked organization structure extends our system. Our bottling partners complement our progress against our capabilities by continuing to invest in the marketplace, and they have put our purpose into action. We have strong partners with highly capable and experienced leadership, and we continue to build and foster our business and each in our relationship that drive system health and long-term growth opportunities., North America, Value\\nMaximization, Retail Dollars, Distribution Points, Networked Organization Structure, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, With our purpose to refresh the world to make a difference, we continue to focus our ESG work on issues where we can have a measurable positive impact on communities as well as create opportunities for our business to grow. We release our fourth combined business and ESG report tomorrow, an integrated approach to reporting that is a strong demonstration of how sustainability is linked to our business, builds resilience, and demonstrates transparency. We have a long history of assuring select sustainability metrics while also providing key public disclosures against the TCFD recommendations as well as other reporting frameworks such as SASB, GRI, and the UN Global Compact. In the report, we highlight how we and our bottling partners are driving business growth through our interconnected ESG goals and how we continue to seek an exponentially greater impact by fostering collective action, partnering across industry, government, and society to address shared challenges., ESG Work,\\nSustainability Metrics, Integrated Reporting, Business Growth, Collective Action, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In conclusion, while there is no doubt the world is more uncertain and the operating environment remains highly dynamic, our strategy remains the same: to execute for sustainable growth through strengthened capabilities in innovation, marketing, RGM, and execution. Now I\\'ll turn the call over to John., Strategy,\\nSustainable Growth, Innovation, Marketing, Execution, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\\'ll highlight our first quarter performance and discuss our full year 2022 earnings guidance; then I\\'ll provide commentary on the overall operating environment and how our organization is navigating effectively to drive results. Let me first start by saying how pleased we are with the results in the first quarter. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 18%; unit cases grew 8%, with strong growth across all operating segments; concentrate sales were ahead of unit cases by three points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and EMEA., First Quarter\\nPerformance, Full Year 2022 Earnings Guidance, Operating Environment, Organic Revenue Growth, Unit\\nCases, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Our price/mix of 7% was driven by strategic pricing, revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of two items: one, consolidating the BODYARMOR; and two, currency headwinds. Underlying gross margin expanded despite continued pressure from commodity costs, due to pricing actions in the market and a benefit from the timing of concentrate shipments. We continue to prioritize consumer-facing marketing to maximize returns while driving productivity in our operating costs leading to leverage in the P&L., Price/Mix, Gross\\nMargin, Commodity Costs, Marketing, Operating Costs, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 50 basis points despite acquisition and currency headwinds. First-quarter comparable EPS of $0.64 grew 16% year over year. This was driven by strong top-line growth, which benefited from the timing of concentrate shipments and operating margin improvements, partially offset by currency and cost headwinds. On the cash flow front, we delivered free cash flow of approximately $400 million in the first quarter as our strong business performance was more than offset primarily by two items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter., Comparable Operating\\nMargin, Comparable EPS, Cash Flow, Working Capital, Annual Incentives, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cash flow goals for the full year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with net debt leverage within our targeted range of two to two and a half times. As James mentioned, much has happened since we last gave guidance in February. The conflict in Ukraine has created further volatility in the world as well as added to the inflationary backdrop and impacted the currency market., Confidence, Cash\\nFlow Goals, Balance Sheet, Net Debt Leverage, Volatility, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, The resurgence of COVID in China and some other geographies around the world is a clear indication that the pandemic is still very much a part of the conversation, and a reminder that the recovery path has been and will continue to be asynchronous. Obviously, there are lots of puts and takes at play, and we see a number of potential futures coming at us. But notwithstanding this backdrop, we believe our organization is better prepared today, and we\\'re confident in the flexibility we\\'ve built and our ability to manage what\\'s around the corner. We continue to spin the growth flywheels faster, and our local businesses are adapting and executing for growth., Pandemic, Recovery\\nPath, Organization Preparedness, Growth Flywheels, Execution, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, With that in mind, this morning, we are reiterating our guidance for 2022. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share guidance of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of a two- to three-point currency headwinds to comparable net revenues and a three- to four-point currency headwinds to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, taking into account our current understanding of recently issued regulations, we now expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022 versus the 20% that we had guided to previously., Organic Revenue Growth,\\nComparable Earnings Per Share Guidance, Currency Outlook, Effective Tax Rate, Regulations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings-per-share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. To put this guidance in context, there are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022. The direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspension of business in Russia is estimated to be approximately $0.04 to comparable EPS., Comparable Earnings Per\\nShare Growth, Free Cash Flow Guidance, Capital Investments, Ukraine Conflict Impact, Context, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, The recent increases in commodity costs are having an incremental effect. But based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect the commodity price inflation to remain in the range of mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. Additionally, we see incremental cost pressure coming from areas like wages and transportation. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins., Commodity Costs,\\nIncremental Effect, Comparable Cost of Goods Sold, Wages, Transportation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, When it comes to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same, and we continue to balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure. For 2022, we announced a dividend increase of 5%, a higher rate than in recent years; and we also announced the resumption of share repurchases with approximately $500 million in net share repurchases expected this year. Despite uncertainties around the world, our strategic transformation has fortified the organization to weather the storm, and we are extremely proud of how our people are responding and delivering. We are keeping consumers at the center, operating more effectively and efficiently, and unlocking the immense potential of our growth portfolio of brands., Capital Allocation,\\nDividend Increase, Share Repurchases, Strategic Transformation, Consumer Focus, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2022, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, This gives us confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for 2022. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions., Confidence,\\nGuidance, Readiness to Take Questions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\\'d like to reflect on the past year and how we\\'ve emerged stronger from the pandemic, including positive performance in the fourth quarter. I\\'ll also highlight the broader macro environment and how we\\'re executing in the marketplace. Finally, I\\'ll touch briefly on the accelerators for growth that give us confidence we can achieve the 2022 guidance we\\'ve provided today, with more on them to come at CAGNY later this month., Positive\\nPerformance, Macro Environment, Market Execution, Confidence Accelerators, Guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John will then discuss financial results for the quarter and our outlook in more detail. But before I get to it, I\\'d like to acknowledge that our ability to emerge stronger would not have been possible without the efforts of our dedicated employees and system partners around the world, and I\\'d like to thank them for their hard work, their contribution not only to our results, but to our curious, empowered, inclusive and agile culture. In 2021, the operating environment remained dynamic as the pandemic continued to evolve and factors like inflation and supply chain disruptions brought additional challenges. But over the year, our organization and the system continued to manage through these circumstances with focus and flexibility., Efforts of\\nEmployees, Emerging Stronger, Operating Environment, Pandemic, Supply Chain Disruptions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are pleased with the results, which were above 2019 across key metrics, and we remain focused on building a stronger total beverage company. Now looking more closely at our fourth quarter results. We saw another quarter of sequential improvement versus 2019, and we ended the year with volume ahead of 2019. Notably, it was the first quarter in which away-from-home volume was also ahead of 2019 while at-home channels remained strong., Results, Focus on Building\\na Stronger Company, Fourth Quarter Results, Volume Growth, Away-from-Home Volume, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, So recapping the quarter 4 performance around the world, starting with Asia Pacific. China delivered strong performance in the quarter by capturing a growing trend among consumers\\' zero-calorie offerings, we doubled our Zero Sugar sparkling portfolio in terms of volume compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. We leveraged RGM strategies and targeting investments to gain share in e-commerce, thus driving growth for the overall business. In India, initiatives to build omnichannel presence and marketing campaigns around key occasions by leveraging festivals and passion points through occasion-led marketing and integrated execution drove a sequential increase in market share and nearly 30% growth in transactions for the quarter., Asia Pacific, China, India,\\nOmnichannel Presence, Marketing Campaigns, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Additionally, our local Thums Up brand became $1 billion brand in India, driven by focused marketing and execution plans. In Japan, while our system was faced with a very challenging year, we gained value share and consumers driven by successful innovation and commercial strategies. In ASEAN and South Pacific, there were strict restrictions and limited reopenings in many markets for a large part of the year. In Q4, acceleration of vaccine efforts and strong results from the Fanta Colorful People and Sprite Make it Clear campaigns helped drive our recovery., Additionally, Local Brand,\\nMarketing Plans, Value Share, Innovation Strategies, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In EMEA, volume in Europe in the quarter surpassed 2019 despite mobility restrictions, particularly in Western Europe. Despite the recovery remaining asynchronous in the region, increased investments behind our brands in the marketplace resulted in our system driving the highest incremental retail value among FMCG players in the region. In Africa, volume continued to be ahead of 2019 in the fourth quarter, driven by our key markets with strong double-digit growth in Nigeria and Egypt. Additionally, increased investments behind our affordability and multi-serve packages drove value share for the full year above 2019 in the region., Volume Growth, Investments\\nBehind Brands, Retail Value, Africa, Nigeria and Egypt, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Eurasia and Middle East, the top line continued to expand faster than the macro environment, driven by strong revenue growth management, execution, and digital capabilities. Turkey, one of our key markets, grew 7 points of value share for the year in digital as total digital commerce expanded by close to 90%. In North America, despite COVID cases leading to business closings and some mobility restrictions, value share growth was strong in the quarter, driven by pricing, revenue growth management, and strong execution in the market. The new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued to deliver strong results, outpacing category growth, while Sprite and smartwater grew drinker base and buy rates., Revenue Growth Management,\\nDigital Capabilities, Value Share Growth, Pricing, Execution in Market, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Innovations also delivered strong performances, led by Coke with Coffee and Simply Almond. Latin America delivered another quarter of strong performance with mid-single-digit volume growth versus 2019. This resilience of the system has been driven by years of experience navigating volatile environments through strong and effective execution. Within Global Ventures, Costa continued to recover through the year but was impacted in Q4 due to COVID-related restrictions., Innovations, Volume Growth,\\nLatin America, Execution, Costa, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Costa Express continued its strong performance in the U.K., delivering results ahead of expectations. In China, the Costa ready-to-drink expansion continued with availability now in more than 300,000 outlets, continuing to drive our share position ahead of our key competitor. Finally, our Bottling Investment Group continues to focus on productivity and transformation initiatives, delivering strong operating margin expansion for full year 2021. Due to improved mobility throughout the year, our industry is growing in both volume and value., Costa Express, China, Costa\\nReady-to-Drink, Bottling Investment Group, Industry Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gaining share was a key objective in our Emerging Stronger agenda. And this year, we gained value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. Our NARTD market share is above 2019 levels at a global level and in both at-home and away-from-home channels. We will continue to identify and address opportunities to further improve our value share, driven by data-backed insights., Gaining Share, Value Share,\\nNARTD Market Share, Data-Backed Insights, Opportunities Improvement, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As we close the chapter on 2021, we emerge stronger by delivering both top line and EPS ahead of 2019, and we gained share in a growing industry. The actions we took during the pandemic have resulted in an agile, a focused organization that is poised to capture the sizable opportunities that exist. And we continue to look to the future to build on our momentum and drive growth. As we turn to 2022, while it is impossible for us to know whether this variant will be the last, what is clear is that our consumers, our customers, and our business are learning and adapting with great resilience., Gaining Share, Emerging\\nStronger, Agile Organization, Opportunities Capture, Resilience, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, For example, while we have seen some impacts from the omicron variant through the first few weeks of the year, we are not seeing the same level of disruption as previous waves, and our system is better equipped. Further recovery in 2022 will be determined by macro factors, including overall consumer sentiment, as well as supply chain challenges; labor shortages; and of course, the inflationary pressures, and interest rates. We are confident we are well equipped to navigate this environment and deliver on the guidance we provided today. Now I\\'ll touch on some of the capabilities we\\'ve built to unlock the next stage of growth and will elaborate more at our virtual CAGNY presentation later this month., Macro Factors, Consumer\\nSentiment, Supply Chain Challenges, Labor Shortages, Inflationary Pressures, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re excited about where we are today and the substantial initiatives we have in place for 2022. The consumer continues to be at the center of our strategy. And through our total beverage company agenda, we are adapting to the macro and micro trends which are shaping consumer habits. We advanced our total beverage company agenda last year by streamlining our portfolio, focusing on the core, and investing behind a portfolio of brands that allows us to meet the evolving needs of consumers., Consumer Strategy, Total\\nBeverage Company Agenda, Macro and Micro Trends, Portfolio Streamlining, Brand Investment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We completed much of this work on brand eliminations while being deliberate with brand transitions. This optimized portfolio will ensure we follow the consumer and win in emerging and fast-growing categories. And is complemented by the recent strategic acquisition of BODYARMOR; as well as relationships, like the new agreement with Constellation Brands, which will launch Fresca Mixed; and the extended relationship with Molson Coors, which will launch Simply Spiked Lemonade in the U.S. Our network marketing model, with global category teams and local operating units, is allowing us to focus on end-to-end consumer experiences that are data-driven and always on., Brand Eliminations, Brand\\nTransitions, Optimized Portfolio, Strategic Acquisition, Network Marketing Model, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our announcement of WPP as our global marketing network partner is a foundational component of our new marketing model. This new agency approach gives us access to the best creative lines, regardless of source, and is underpinned by leading-edge data and technology capabilities. The Real Magic campaign is the first campaign which was cocreated internally leveraging this new end-to-end approach. And the campaign is showing strong results with the consumers., New Marketing Model, Global\\nMarket Network Partner, Leading-Edge Data and Technology Capabilities, Real Magic Campaign, Consumer\\nResults, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We have good visibility into the benefits of the new marketing model. The approach will allow us to deliver best-in-class consumer-centric marketing experiences across our categories and around the world. We also built more discipline into our innovation process in 2021 with a key focus on scalable bets that can build momentum year over year. It\\'s still early, but the approach is working., New Marketing Model,\\nConsumer-Centric Marketing Experiences, Innovation Process, Scalable Bets, Early Results, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Revenue per launch and gross profit per launch were up 30% and 25%, respectively, versus prior year. And we took intelligent local experiments and moved more rapidly to scale them across geographies. Sustainable packaging like refillables and labelless bottles, along with brands like Coke with Coffee, fairlife, AHA, Costa ready-to-drink, and Lemondo, are all examples of local winners that have been extended to more markets. For 2022, our innovation process is increasingly supported by data, and our pipeline is robust with built-in agility and consists of big bets along with many shots on goal., Revenue Per Launch, Gross\\nProfit Per Launch, Sustainable Packaging, Local Winners, Innovation Process, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The system has stepped up its RGM and execution capabilities, which is helping us navigate an inflationary environment, driving value growth in a segmented way. Due to the strength of our bottling partners and the stronger than ever alignment of the system, we are prepared to address opportunities, as well as challenges that may lie ahead. Our network organizational structure is designed to better connect functions and operating units to help our system scale ideas faster. As we\\'ve emerged stronger, we kept moving forward on integrating sustainability work into our business as it is a key driver of future growth., RGM and Execution\\nCapabilities, Value Growth, Stronger Alignment, Network Organizational Structure, Sustainability\\nWork, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, During the quarter, we were recognized for our commitment to transparency and action to address environmental risks by earning an A score in CDP\\'s Assessment for Water, an improvement over last year. We improved or maintained our score in CDP\\'s assessments on other important areas, like climate and forests. Additionally, to complement our World Without Waste goals, we announced a new global goal to reach 25% reusable packaging by 2030. Increasing refillable and reusable packaging options responds to consumer affordability and our sustainability aspirations, and it helps create a circular economy as refillable packages have extremely high levels of collection and are low carbon footprint beverage containers., Transparency, Environmental\\nRisks, CDP Assessments, World Without Waste Goals, Reusable Packaging, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, before I turn over to John, I want to say a big thank you and recognize our associates from both the company and our bottling partners, who worked with great dedication and unwavering commitment throughout another challenging year. We expect the recovery will remain asynchronous, but we are encouraged by our growing industry, our unparalleled system strength, and a strategic transformation that enables us to be agile and to adapt. Our actions drove strong results in 2021, and we have confidence in our ability to deliver another year of strong performance in 2022 and over the long term. Now John will provide more details on our results and our 2020 guidance., Dedication, Commitment,\\nGrowing Industry, System Strength, Strong Results, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we closed the year with strong results, despite the impact of the omicron variant across many parts of the world. Our Q4 organic revenue growth was 9%. Our price/mix of 10% was driven by a combination of factors, including targeted pricing, revenue growth management initiatives, as well as further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets., Strong Results, Omicron\\nVariant, Q4 Organic Revenue Growth, Price/Mix, Away-From-Home Channels, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Unit case growth showed further sequential improvement on a two-year basis, and concentrate sales lagged unit cases by 10 points in the quarter, primarily due to six fewer days in the quarter. Despite the commodity market inflation and the dynamic supply chain environment, comparable gross margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus prior year. Pricing initiatives and favorable channel and package mix were offset by the impact of consolidating the fast-growing finished goods BODYARMOR business, along with incremental investments to sustain momentum in the overall business for 2022. We continued to invest in markets as they recovered and stepped up year-over-year marketing dollars again in Q4, spending in a targeted way to maximize returns., Unit Case Growth,\\nConcentrate Sales, Comparable Gross Margin, Pricing Initiatives, Marketing Dollars, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, This increase in marketing investments, along with some top-line pressure from six fewer days in the quarter, resulted in comparable operating margin compression of approximately 500 basis points for the quarter. For the full year, comparable operating margin was down approximately 100 basis points versus prior year as improved comparable gross margin was offset by the significant step-up in marketing. Importantly, versus 2019, a key measure we have focused on, comparable operating margin was up approximately 100 basis points. Putting it all together., Marketing investments, top line pressure, operating margin compression, full year\\nperformance, 2019 comparison, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Fourth quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.45 was a decline of 5% year over year, resulting in full year comparable earnings per share of $2.32, an increase of 19% versus the prior year, as the strong resurgence in the business also benefited from a 3-point tailwind from currency and tax. We delivered strong free cash flow of $11.3 billion in 2021, with free cash flow conversion of approximately 115% and a dividend payout ratio well below our long-term target of 75%. With these results, we exceeded guidance on every metric for full year 2021. We have done tremendous work to emerge ahead of 2019 and set the stage to drive our growth agenda for years to come., Earnings per share, full year performance, free cash flow, dividend payout ratio,\\nguidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We are spinning the strategy flywheels faster and more effectively. Our organization is focused on execution and enhancing our capabilities to fuel growth. As James mentioned, the pandemic will be one of the many factors, along with the dynamic macro backdrop that we face in the coming year. But our local businesses are ready to adapt and execute for growth., Strategy, execution, organization, growth, macro environment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, With that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2022 that builds our momentum from 2021. We expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8%, and we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings-per-share growth of 8% to 10% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 3-point currency headwind to comparable revenue and an approximate 3 to 4 points currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, due to a certain change in recent regulations, we estimate an effective tax rate increase from 18.6% in 2021 to 20% for 2022, which is an estimated 2 percentage points headwind to EPS., Guidance, revenue growth, earnings per share growth, currency headwinds, tax rate\\nincrease, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Therefore, all in, we expect comparable earnings-per-share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021, including the combined 5- to 6-point headwind from currency and tax. We expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow over 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. This implies the fourth consecutive year of free cash flow conversion above our long-term range of 90% to 95%. We continue to raise the performance bar across the organization and are confident in delivering on this 2022 guidance., Comparable earnings per share growth, free cash flow, capital investments, long-\\nterm range, performance bar, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, In summary, we expect to deliver another year of strong top-line-driven growth, along with maximized returns, driven by the strategic changes we have made in our business. There are several considerations to keep in mind for 2022. Overall, inflationary and supply chain pressures continue to impact costs across several fronts in the business, including input costs, transportation, marketing and operating expenses. With regards to commodity costs., Strong growth, strategic changes, inflationary pressures, supply chain pressures,\\ncommodity costs, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, After benefiting from our hedging strategy in 2021, we remain well hedged in 2022, but at higher levels. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect commodity price inflation to have a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. However, we are taking actions in the marketplace using multiple levers, including RGM in its many forms, along with our productivity initiatives, to help offset much of the impact. As a reminder for your modeling, the consolidation of the recently acquired fast-growing BODYARMOR finished goods business will have a mechanical effect on margins., Hedging strategy, commodity price inflation, cost of goods sold, productivity\\ninitiatives, margin impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, When it comes to capital allocation, our balance sheet remains strong, and our improving cash flow position is allowing us to be even more vigorous in pursuit of priorities that balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure, first and foremost, to invest in our business; secondly, continuing our track record to grow our dividend; thirdly, to seek opportune M&A, and to repurchase shares with excess cash. And finally, due to the calendar shift, there will be one less day in the first quarter and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Despite another year of uncertainty, in 2021, we came together as a system to emerge stronger and position ourselves to drive sustainable growth. We are encouraged by the momentum in our business and are clear on the direction we\\'re headed., Capital allocation, balance sheet, cash flow position, dividend growth, M&A, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, As we look to 2022, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on the commitments we outlined today. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\\xa0, Confidence, ability to deliver, commitments, questions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. After a strong first half of the year, we saw continued momentum in our business in the third quarter. While the global recovery remains asynchronous, our people and our systems are leverage the learnings to deliver good results and emerge stronger. And while markets are at different stages of reopening around the world, our local businesses have been increasingly resilient through restrictions and lockdowns., Strong results, global recovery, asynchronous recovery, local business resilience,\\nemerging stronger, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As a result, our underlying volumes have accelerated on a two-year basis with quarterly growth versus 2019 for the first time since the pandemic began. This improvement has been supported by our transformation agenda, which set us on a path to more efficient and effective marketing, as well as more disciplined and intelligent innovation. We\\'re investing accordingly behind our portfolio of loved brands and are seeing signs of early traction. Given strong results year to date and increased visibility into the rest of the year, we expect to deliver organic revenue at the high end of our previously provided range and are raising bottom line and cash flow guidance for the full year., Underlying volumes, transformation agenda, marketing investment, brand portfolio,\\nrevenue growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This morning, I\\'ll provide a business update and discuss how our network organization is executing well in this dynamic environment. Then John will discuss our financials and raised guidance and some early considerations for 2022. In the first half of 2021, mobility and business levels improved in many markets as lockdowns eased and vaccinations increased. The recovery has not been a straight line and continues to be uneven around the world., Business update, network organization, financials, mobility recovery, vaccination\\nimpact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, But despite the asynchronous recovery, in the third quarter, our volumes surpassed 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began. Although not yet back to 2019 levels as a percent of our business, we saw sequential improvement in away-from-home volumes on a two-year basis as consumers returned to many of their former routines. At-home volumes also showed ongoing strength even as away-from-home channels improved. The quarter was off to a promising start in July, but the Delta variant impacted several markets, resulting in a softer August, followed by improvement in September as the variant began to lessen in some of our key markets., Volumes, recovery, sequential improvement, at-home volumes, Delta variant impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The pandemic continues to be a key factor across our operating environment, in addition to the ongoing pressure points in our supply chain. However, our network system is leveraging the learnings from the past 18 months, sharing best practices and skillfully executing by applying revenue growth management and working our supply chain levers to capitalize on the strengths of our brands and mitigate disruptions. The industry is growing, and we continue to gain share. Our overall value share improved year on year and remains above 2019 levels., Pandemic, supply chain pressure, revenue growth management, share gain, value\\nshare improvement, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are pleased to report gains across categories, as well as both within at-home and away-from-home channels. Our operating units are combining the power of scale with the deep knowledge required to win locally in an environment that remains dynamic. So, diving a little into the key drivers across our geographies, starting with Asia Pacific. In China, media investments across categories are yielding promising signs., Gains across categories, operating units, dynamic environment, geographies, media\\ninvestments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Results in the quarter reflect strict COVID lockdowns and some weather-related disruption in August while September marked sequential improvement. Japan\\'s state of emergency was lifted at the end of the quarter after consumers spent the majority of 2021 in lockdown. Strengthened execution across our teams and innovation have helped lessen impacts, and our consumer base has grown beyond 2019 levels. In India, we participated strongly in the recovery by focusing on affordability and omnichannel growth through eB2B., Results, COVID lockdowns, sequential improvement, execution, consumer base growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We grew both Trademark Coke and local icon, Thums Up, using effective marketing activations. We had share gains in ASEAN and the South Pacific operating units despite pandemic-related restrictions in all of its top markets. Our investments behind sparkling flavors and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar will continue to create value when lockdowns are lifted. In EMEA, in Europe, we gained value share across nearly all categories as restrictions eased., Growth, marketing activations, share gains, pandemic-related restrictions, value\\nshare improvement, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, While weather, a slower recovery in tourism and the Delta surge had an impact, our global campaigns for key brands, including Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Sprite, and Fanta, helped drive sparkling\\'s share. As vaccinations accelerated in Eurasia and the Middle East, we maintained momentum through effective revenue growth management initiatives, resulting in top line that expanded faster than the macro environment in those top markets. Our results in Africa were balanced across regions and categories during this quarter despite a third wave of the pandemic that resulted in targeted lockdowns. Vaccination rates remain on the low side relative to the rest of the world, and our focus remains on affordability and single-serve packs as mobility increases in countries like Egypt and Nigeria., Global campaigns, share, revenue growth management, vaccination rates,\\naffordability, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We maintained strong momentum in North America despite a COVID resurgence in many states, leading to stalling consumer sentiments and supply chain challenges that resulted in both missed opportunities and incremental costs. The at-home channel remains healthy. And although away-from-home growth accelerated early in the quarter, labor shortages have constrained capacity with some on-premise customers. Recent price actions to offset higher input costs have been effective with lower-than-expected price elasticities to date, and promotional levels remain below 2019., Strong momentum, COVID resurgence, consumer sentiments, supply chain challenges,\\nprice actions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Latin America, successful commercial initiatives, including affordability packs, increased availability of our key products and strong customer execution in both modern and traditional trade, drove volume growth across all major markets amid an improving COVID environment. Improvement in single-serve mix, some pricing actions and connecting brand strategies to on-premise customers to drive further recovery in the away-from-home channel all contributed to strong price/mix. Within global ventures, Costa benefited from retail store recovery as the U.K. reopened with improved reach and frequency from its enhanced loyalty program., Successful commercial initiatives, affordability packs, customer execution,\\nsingle-serve mix, pricing actions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Costa continues to expand across platforms into new markets in partnership with our bottlers, resulting in growing brand awareness. Our bottling investments group performance was driven by India and the Philippines. BIG saw strict lockdowns in several markets, as well as rising inflation but has continued to see share gains year to date in South Africa. Adverse impacts have been well managed through package and category mix improvements along with cost controls, preserving progress on our operating margin during the pandemic., Costa expansion, bottling investments, BIG performance, share gains, cost\\ncontrols, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Global category teams are working with our operating units to build an engine to drive effective marketing at scale and innovation which can be amplified across the world. Highlights from this quarter include Coca-Cola Zero Sugar\\'s new recipe has rolled out in more than 50 countries and has had accelerated growth in the last three months. In September, Trademark Coca-Cola\\'s new global brand philosophy, Real Magic, was unveiled, featuring a refreshed look for our iconic logo, the Hug. The Real Magic platform takes a digital-first approach, and our execution feature a range of experiences that are tailored to Gen Z and leverage passion points like gaming and music to attract the new generation of drinkers., Global category teams, effective marketing, innovation, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar,\\nTrademark Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sparkling flavors gained share in the quarter driven by investments in targeted brand-country combinations with a focus on occasions and zero sugar offerings. In China, Sprite volume growth was accelerated by leveraging the global Let\\'s Be Clear campaign during summer music festivals. Similarly, the #WhatTheFanta campaign focuses on snacking and is driving growth across all key metrics in Europe. The hydration, sports, tea, and coffee categories are seeing a good return on spend behind global brands., Sparkling flavors, brand-country combinations, share gain, China volume growth,\\nEurope campaign, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AHA\\'s expansion into new markets this year has shown flexibility to adapt to local customer and consumer needs. In advanced hydration, functional benefits have helped to stretch brand power and drive share for Aquarius as it becomes more of a global brand. Tea and coffee have had success with Fuze Tea in Europe and both Ayataka and Costa ready-to-drink in Japan. There is an opportunity to recover share in Georgia Coffee as the at-work occasion returns., AHA expansion, local customer needs, functional benefits, global brand power,\\nshare recovery, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our juice portfolio gained share this quarter, helped by Minute Maid Pulpy performance in China, Del Valle growth in Latin America and strong results across brands in Africa. In dairy, fairlife is set to become the first billion-dollar brand in our dairy portfolio and has recently launched its joint venture in China. Our experimentation with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is expanding, and we\\'re gathering valuable insights globally, including the importance of building the category in regions where it is nascent. We are seeing encouraging performance where the flavored alcoholic beverage category is growing rapidly, and we have on-shelf presence., Juice portfolio, Minute Maid Pulpy, Del Valle, fairlife, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors recently announced the national rollout of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in the US with new Margarita flavors. We also recently announced the expansion of our relationship with Molson Coors to bring the brand into Canada. As the pandemic recovery has progressed, we\\'ve seen challenges and disruptions in many parts of the world, in addition to inflationary forces that could persist. We have years of experience in dealing with these types of environments and are enhancing our strong capabilities that enable us to do so., Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, national rollout, new Margarita flavors, pandemic\\nrecovery, inflationary forces, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are using the crucial tool of revenue growth management and its many forms and are executing in collaboration with our bottling partners. We continue to refine our ability to optimize price and package offerings according to occasions, brands and channels, striking the right balance between premiumization and affordability. In addition to streamlining our portfolio, targeting more disciplined innovation, intelligent experimentation and transforming our marketing model, we\\'re also building strong digital capabilities. We have taken an enterprise approach and are progressing on the rollout of multi-category eB2B platforms with our bottlers globally., Revenue growth management, price and package offerings, portfolio optimization,\\ndigital capabilities, eB2B platforms, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As an example, Wabi is seeing strong growth outside its home market of Latin America has more than 50 categories contributing meaningfully to its sales on the platform. Additionally, we are delivering outsized growth through a powerful and growing omnichannel presence across regions. We\\'re driving incremental incidents with partners like foodservice aggregators. North America, for example, has grown attachment rates by mid-single digits with third-party and restaurant-owned platforms., Wabi growth, omnichannel presence, foodservice aggregators, attachment rates,\\nNorth America, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And we\\'re gaining share in e-commerce with significant wins in Eurasia and hitting record levels in Latin America this quarter. I\\'d also like to reiterate that sustainability is an integral part of our business strategy and is a key driver of future growth. From 2018 when we launched World Without Waste through today, we\\'ve made much progress against our pillars to design, collect and partner to deliver against our goals. Our commitment to reduce waste globally is also closely connected to our climate ambitions because collecting more empty packages, using more recycled material, lightweighting our bottles and using plant-based materials are all ways we are embracing the collective effort to decarbonize the global economy., gaining share in e-commerce, sustainability, World Without Waste, reducing waste\\nglobally, climate ambitions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We strive to provide stakeholders with clear progress against our goals through our annual business and ESG report and our World Without Waste reports, including using the Global Reporting Initiative, SASB, and TCFD reporting framework, as well as disclosures through other publicly available avenues like CDP and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We continuously revisit our ESG reporting and disclosures to ensure our leadership position. We do not take our responsibility lightly, and we carefully and thoroughly vet long-term objectives with our system partners and only commit new goals with a clear, actionable plan. To ensure we remain transparent and responsive to this evolving landscape, we\\'d like to invite you to join us for our virtual ESG event on November 3, where key business and sustainability leaders will provide an update on our initiatives and answer your questions., ESG reporting, stakeholder communication, long-term objectives, sustainability\\nleadership, virtual ESG event, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As we look at our year-to-date performance as a system, it\\'s clear that we are emerging stronger from the pandemic, delivering solid results under a more network structure. Now, I\\'ll turn the call to John to discuss our third-quarter results, our updated outlook and some initial thoughts about 2022., year-to-date performance, pandemic recovery, third-quarter results, updated\\noutlook, 2022 thoughts, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James. In the third quarter, we delivered another set of strong results, building on the momentum we\\'ve seen this year. Our Q3 organic revenue was up 14% with concentrate shipments up 8% and price/mix up 6%. Price/mix was led by strong pricing in North America and Latin America and further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets., Q3 results, organic revenue, concentrate shipments, price/mix, geographic\\nperformance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Unit case growth was 6% with absolute unit cases ahead of 2019 levels for the first time this year and a sequential improvement versus the second quarter on a two-year basis. Concentrate shipment outpaced unit cases in the quarter due to inventory build by some of our bottling partners to manage through near-term disruption. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 160 basis points versus prior year, driven by pricing in the market, positive mix and timing of shipments. Despite some pressure points in the supply chain, we\\'re successfully pulling the levers at our disposal to mitigate impacts to the best of our ability., unit case growth, concentrate shipments, comparable gross margin, supply chain\\npressure, inventory build, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We continued to invest as many markets reopened during the quarter and significantly stepped up our marketing dollars versus prior year. As a result, our comparable operating margin compressed by 40 basis points year over year, more than offsetting the flow-through from the strong top line. Below operating income, we saw some leverage come through from the other income line and a lower tax rate for the quarter that was driven by our updated effective tax rate for the full year to 18.6% from 19.1% previously. Putting all of this together, third-quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.65 was an increase of 18% year over year, including a three-point benefit from currency., investment, marketing spend, comparable operating margin, other income, tax rate, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We also delivered strong year to date free cash flow of $8.5 billion. Given our strong results and with one quarter remaining, we have good visibility and are raising guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 13% to 14%, which is at the high end of our previously provided range, and comparable EPS growth of 15% to 17% in 2021. Our updated guidance for free cash flow of approximately $10.5 billion represent significant progress over the past few years and particularly during the COVID era., year-to-date free cash flow, full-year guidance, organic revenue growth,\\ncomparable EPS growth, free cash flow guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, This progress is further dimensionalized as follows: We expect to achieve this year a dividend payout ratio below our long-term target of 75% of free cash flow for the time since 2015. We anticipate delivering another year of free cash flow conversion above 100%. And finally, our expected free cash flow has almost doubled since 2017. Our improving cash flow position will allow us to be even more vigorous in pursuit of our capital allocation priorities., dividend payout ratio, free cash flow conversion, free cash flow growth, capital\\nallocation priorities, cash flow position, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, First and foremost, to invest in our business. Secondly, continuing our track record to grow our dividend. Thirdly, to seek opportune M&A. And finally, with excess cash to repurchase our shares., investing in business, growing dividend, M&A opportunities, share repurchases,\\ncash management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, So, as we think about Q4, a few things to keep in mind. One, the recovery phase looks different around the world, and we expect that to continue. Two, we continue to see a minimal commodity impact due to hedges we have in place for the remainder of the year. Three, from a marketing perspective, we expect to increase consumer-facing marketing spend toward levels similar to 2019 while improving the quality of that spend and allocating it in a more targeted manner., Q4 recovery, commodity impact, marketing spend, targeted marketing, consumer-\\nfacing marketing, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Four, our currency outlook continues to contemplate a tailwind of 1% to 2% to the top line and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedge position. Last but not least, our current full-year guidance has built in the leveling out of our concentrate shipments that are running ahead year to date due to timing considering that we have six fewer days in the fourth quarter. It\\'s not typical for us to provide commentary on the year ahead at this stage, but I would like to highlight a few points regarding 2022 given the dynamics we are already seeing. While there are puts and takes to consider from the pandemic looking into next year, we\\'re confident in the underlying top line trajectory, supported by our transformation work, our innovation agenda and a more efficient and effective approach to marketing., currency outlook, concentrate shipments, full-year guidance, transformation\\nwork, innovation agenda, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Along with this ongoing momentum in revenues, we also expect to see some higher costs. We are not immune to the commodity inflation that has been impacting the world for the better part of 2021 nor the rapidly changing environment. We\\'ve been successful with hedges that were put in place to mitigate the impact of input cost inflation, and those will begin to roll off in 2022. Based on current rates and hedge position, we\\'d expect commodity inflation to have a mid-single-digit impact on our cost of goods sold in 2022., ongoing momentum, commodity inflation, hedges, cost of goods Sold, mid-single-\\ndigit impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'ve been proactively accelerating our revenue growth management and productivity levers to offset some of this pressure as we look out to next year. And we\\'re closely monitoring the moving parts in the supply chain to ensure we are well positioned to meet demand. Moving to marketing dollars. We\\'ll continue to invest purposefully in our brands and markets to support top line growth with spend more heavily weighted toward consumer-facing activity., revenue growth management, productivity levers, supply chain management,\\nmarketing spend, consumer-facing activity, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Regarding currency, if we were to assume current rates and our hedge position, there would be an approximate two to three-point currency headwind to revenue and a two to three-point headwind to earnings for the full-year 2022. Of course, volatility remains, and several factors could have an impact on our currency outlook between now and February. Overall, as vaccinations continue to progress globally, we are in a better position today to navigate this environment, and we feel good about the potential for our business. We look forward to coming back with more specific items after the fourth quarter., currency headwind, revenue, earnings, vaccination progress, potential business\\ngrowth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, In closing, I\\'d like to acknowledge the more than 700,000 men and women of the Coca-Cola system whose tremendous dedication and hard work have been instrumental to delivering the strong results in the first nine months of the year. The alignment of our system and its deft navigation through a challenging supply environment and an asynchronous pandemic recovery have been key enablers to emerging stronger. We\\'re confident in our updated guidance and our ability to further leverage our strong capabilities to drive sustainable top line growth and maximize returns. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions., tremendous dedication, hard work, strong results, supply environment,\\nasynchronous pandemic recovery, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, thanks to the tremendous efforts by our associates and our bottling partners, we executed on our key emerging stronger priorities as many parts of the world gradually reopens. As we continue to deliver on our transformation, we are encouraged by our results and are raising our top line, bottom line and cash flow guidance even as we are accelerating investments for the future. At the same time, we also recognize the trajectory may be dynamic and understand that we must remain flexible to respond to changes in the environment., tremendous efforts, key priorities, transformation, results, investments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, This morning, I\\'ll provide a business update and discuss how disciplined innovation and more effective and efficient marketing are driving broad-based share gains and are delivering enhanced value for our system. Then I\\'ll hand the call over to John to discuss our financial update, including our improved outlook for the year. Last year, in the face of a global pandemic, we laid out a path to emerge stronger from across five strategic priorities. We are delivering against those priorities, and this quarter demonstrates the power of our system., disciplined innovation, effective marketing, broad-based share gains, financial\\nupdate, strategic priorities, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We started 2021 with promising results. Mobility and business levels improved in the first quarter, and this trend continued in the second. Consumer mobility increased in markets where vaccination rates are reaching meaningful levels. And our business has recovered as we\\'re lapping last year\\'s biggest lockdown impacts and see our strategies in motion., promising results, mobility levels, business recovery, vaccination rates,\\nstrategies in motion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Consumers have started to return to many prior routine. And as a result, our away-from-home volumes steadily improved as a percent of our business this quarter, driving strong price mix and margin acceleration across the enterprise. However, the recovery remains asynchronous. And several parts of the world have dealt with further waves of infections, leading to delayed openings and in some cases, heightened restrictions., consumer return, away-from-home volumes, price mix, margin acceleration,\\nasynchronous recovery, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, India and Southeast Asia were our only areas that did not see sequential volume acceleration on a two year basis this quarter. Despite the asynchronous recovery, our revenues and earnings in the second quarter surpassed our 2019 results. We also made progress on share this quarter. We said many times that gaining share is a key objective in our emerging stronger agenda., India, Southeast Asia, sequential volume acceleration, earnings, share gain, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, And I\\'m pleased to report that we have achieved that objective with broad-based share gains across categories as well as in both our at-home and away-from-home channels in the quarter. And importantly, despite away-from-home channels not having fully recovered, our value share today is higher than the 2019 levels, confirming that our effective brand building and innovation along with our advanced revenue growth management and market execution capabilities are working. So let me dive a bit deeper into the key drivers across our geographies. In Asia Pacific, China saw continued momentum across categories driven by both volume and improved mix with Trademark Coca-Cola., broad-based share gains, at-home channels, away-from-home channels,\\ngeographies, brand building, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We outpaced the overall macroeconomic recovery, led by strong performance in away-from-home channels and business-to-consumer e-commerce. Australia and New Zealand were bright spots, performing at or close to 2019 levels, but they are currently seeing renewed lockdowns. While Japan is struggling to come out of lockdown, there have been tangible successes with consumer-led innovation, small-pack initiatives and improved customer execution of key initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, in India and across much of Southeast Asia, resurgence in the virus impacted further recovery., strong performance, away-from-home channels, business-to-consumer e-commerce,\\nconsumer-led innovation, small-pack initiatives, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, As India\\'s restrictions have eased a bit, we\\'re encouraged by the level of resilience in both the business as well as our system associates as they have navigated this resurgence. In EMEA, Europe is still being impacted by some level of restriction, but vaccination rates and consumer confidence are improving. Because of this and our strong bottle alignment and marketing investments, we are seeing a much improved away-from-home mix even as at-home volumes continue to grow. Great Britain and Russia, where mobility was at the highest, show notable volume outperformance relative to 2019 and sparkling soft drinks gained or maintained share in most of the top 10 markets in Europe., Resilience, Restrictions, Vaccination Rates, Consumer Confidence, Volume Outperformance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Eurasia and the Middle East are performing well despite a diverse recovery landscape. In Turkey and Pakistan, strong execution during the key Ramadan holiday and emphasis on snacking and meal occasions drove new consumers to the Coke brands. Africa delivered a strong first half performance with affordability packages delivering good results despite tightened restrictions heading into the winter season and vaccination rates that are behind the rest of the world. In North America, the consumer environment improved through the quarter as many states lifted restrictions and consumer mobility increased., Recovery\\nLandscape, Execution, Snacking, Affordability Packages, Consumer Environment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, More frequent social gatherings and rising travel and event activity drove significantly higher demand for our brands in away-from-home channels, while at-home volumes remained robust, leading to broad-based share gains in the quarter. Within away-from-home, eating and drinking was the strongest performing channel with travel, hospitality and at-work trailing. In Latin America, lockdowns eased as vaccination programs rolled out in countries such as Mexico and Argentina. And stimulus programs in Brazil and Chile also helped drive recovery., Demand,\\nShare Gains, Away-From-Home Channels, Eating and Drinking, Latin America, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Our results and year to date share gains in the region continue to be driven by commercial initiatives to improve execution as well as a focus on affordable packs like refillables. Costa\\'s U.K. coffee shop revenues recovered almost entirely to 2019 levels through the reopening phase despite ongoing capacity restrictions. Increased consumer traffic and digital momentum are also supporting recovery as restrictions eased in other countries where we have a retail presence., Commercial Initiatives, Execution, Affordable Packs, Costa\\'s Revenue Recovery, Consumer\\nTraffic and Digital Momentum, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Our bottling investments group faced pandemic-related challenges, particularly in India and Southeast Asia, but managed to sequentially improve or gain share in India, Vietnam, the Philippines and South Africa. BIG also made great progress against its growth and productivity agenda, increasing year-to-date comparable operating margin, approximately 300 basis points from the 2019 levels. Our category teams are collaborating with a global lens, enabling us to move even faster toward our Beverages for Life ambition; are continuously engaging consumers around their passion points and testing ideas in a coordinated and, increasingly, digital way. We are getting even better at what we\\'ve all always done best, building love brands around the world., Bottling\\nInvestments, Share Gain, Category Teams, Consumer Engagement, Love Brands, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, For a few examples. The Coke trademark portfolio is experiencing robust growth, led by brand Coke and driven in part by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which has contributed double-digit growth in value and volume year to date. The new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar recipe has already launched in nearly 50 markets across six of our operating units, including last week\\'s announcement in the U.S. with more to come this year., Robust Growth,\\nBrand Coke, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, New Recipe, Market Launches, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Early results indicate the recipe and simplified packaging design are resonating strongly with consumers. In sparkling flavors, we are accelerating our Zero Sugar offerings and executing global campaigns that focus on key occasions. Sprite has done well globally, benefiting from the Let\\'s be Clear campaign, which has led to improved share gains. Likewise, the #WhatTheFanta mystery flavor campaign in Europe drove accelerated growth and improved share., Recipe\\nResonation, Simplified Packaging Design, Sparkling Flavors, Share Gains, Global Campaigns, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Dairy remains an opportunity for the overall portfolio with premium offerings in key brands like Hollandia drinkable yogurt and Santa Clara\\'s flavored milk showing healthy growth. We continue to leverage fairlife\\'s great success in the U.S. with a recent expansion in Canada. There are many bright spots in hydration, sports, tea and coffee., Dairy\\nOfferings, Premium Brands, Healthy Growth, Expansion, Bright Spots, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We see momentum across brands in the U.S., including good results from our renewed focus on smart water, a new brand bundle from Gold Peak Tea, exciting flavor innovations in Dunkin\\' Coffee and continued growth from expanded distribution of Topo Chico sparkling mineral water. We\\'ve had early success with Costa ready-to-drink launches in Asia with meaningful share gains in key markets in China and was already voted a hit product in Japan. The rapid consumer traction and attractive proposition of healthy indulgence by AHA, which began as an intelligent local experiment in the U.S., led us to believe it can transition to be a bigger bet and travel internationally. The recent launch in China with the local name of little universe has been encouraging with meaningful value share gains in a short period of time., Momentum Across Brands, Renewed Focus on Smart Water, New Brand Bundle from Gold Peak\\nTea, Exciting Flavor Innovations in Dunkin\\' Coffee, Expanded Distribution of Topo Chico Sparkling\\nMineral Water, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We continue to build on momentum with the launch of AHA\\'s first 360-degree marketing campaign with a significant digital emphasis titled, can I get an AHA. Finally, last summer, we announced more exploration in the dynamic flavored alcoholic beverage category with the launch of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is now in 17 markets worldwide, and we\\'ve authorized Molson Coors the right to produce and sell Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in the United States. Launching a global brand in markets where the category is at different stages of development comes with many learnings, and our local knowledge allows us to adapt with speed to win or, in some cases, develop this new category., Momentum, AHA\\nMarketing Campaign, Launch of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, Global Expansion, Local Knowledge, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, From strong performance in Europe, where available, to top two position in Mexico, to the U.S., where velocity is robust and the product has enjoyed positive consumer reactions, we are encouraged by recent trends and are gaining valuable insights along the way. We continue to make progress with our consumer-facing digital propositions. Internally, we were building out our platform services organization to support the enterprise as we have a sizable opportunity to become as a holistic digital leader. Digital is of the utmost importance, and we\\'re also building an integrated ecosystem of platforms that create value across the digital and physical worlds., Strong\\nPerformance, Positive Consumer Reactions, Digital Propositions, Platform Services Organization,\\nIntegrated Ecosystem, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We are partnering with our bottlers to leverage the power of the system\\'s physical footprint online, creating enhanced value for customers across the globe through a best-in-class eB2B platform. With pockets of excellence in many regions, we are working with our bottling partners to evolve and streamline our approach. Working together as a system allows us to improve distribution economics, solve unmet needs of outlet owners and opens new revenue streams by providing other CPG brands access to our deep customer relationships and global distribution network.

On top of the initiatives discussed today, we also continue to work with our bottlers to embed RGM principles and integrate execution capabilities into our processes to continue driving basket value and incidents as the world reopens. Through enhanced execution, we have an opportunity to win with more consumers and grow share by having the right products in the right channel at the right price, supported by the right activations. We also continue with our sustainability agenda to create shared value for our stakeholders and the communities we serve., Consumer\\nExperience, Availability and Assortment, RGM Principles, Execution Capabilities, Sustainability\\nAgenda, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, In addition to integrating ESG considerations into our daily business decisions, during the second quarter, we released our business and ESG report, highlighting progress across all our goals as well as our World Without Waste report, which focuses exclusively on our work to create a circular economy for our packaging materials. Highlights include the continued rollout of a 100% recycled PET with 30 markets representing approximately 30% of our total sales offering at least one brand in a 100% rPET packaging. We\\'ve continued the expansion of refillables and dispense packaging and ultra-lightweighting technologies, and we delivered a 60% global collection rate for packaging in 2020. We are proud of these achievements, and we know there is more work to be done., ESG\\nConsiderations, Business and ESG Report, World Without Waste Report, Circular Economy, Packaging\\nMaterials, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Recently, we announced that we\\'ve become a global implementation partner for The Ocean Cleanup\\'s river project, supporting the deployment of cleanup systems across 15 rivers across the world. We will embed our marketing capabilities into this partnership to create consumer awareness of the issues and the actions we\\'re all taking. Putting it all together, we realize there\\'s a range of possible outcomes when it comes to the pandemic in the second half of the year, given the asynchronous recovery. While we overdelivered relative to our expectations in the first half and have raised guidance for 2021, we are biased toward a growth mentality, and we\\'ll invest behind this momentum going into the rest of the year., Global\\nImplementation Partnership, River Project, Consumer Awareness, Pandemic Recovery, Growth Mentality, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Our network organization is beginning to help us move faster to capture opportunities and create value for our stakeholders. As a system, we are increasingly equipped to win and we\\'re excited about the future. Now, I\\'ll turn the call over to John to discuss our second-quarter results and the drivers of our updated outlook., Network\\nOrganization, Capturing Opportunities, Creating Value, Second-Quarter Results, Updated Outlook, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Thank you, James. This morning, I\\'ll highlight the drivers of our second-quarter performance as well as our revised guidance. In the second quarter, we built on the momentum from the beginning of the year, and our business mix improved as consumer mobility increased across many markets. Our Q2 organic revenue was up 37%, comprised of concentrate shipments up 26% and price mix improvement of 11% as we lapped the biggest pandemic impacts of 2020., Second-Quarter\\nPerformance, Business Mix, Consumer Mobility, Organic Revenue, Price Mix Improvement, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Unit case growth was 18%. Our shipments outpaced unit cases in the quarter and year to date due to cycling the destocking we experienced last year and certain timing impacts this year, including five additional days in the first quarter. Improvement in the away-from-home channels and positive segment mix from higher growth in our finished goods businesses positively impacted our price mix. Channel and package mix also affected comparable gross margin, which showed significant improvement relative to last year, even with certain inflationary costs like transportation coming through., Unit Case\\nGrowth, Shipments, Price Mix, Channel and Package Mix, Comparable Gross Margin, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, As we said throughout the pandemic, our goal is to emerge stronger, and we are investing ahead of recovery as markets reopen. As a result, we have doubled our marketing dollars year over year, cycling the significant pullback from the same period last year. Even with the step-up in those investments, we delivered a 170-basis-point improvement in comparable operating margins driven by the strong top line. Below operating income, we saw a benefit from improvement in our equity income as our bottling partners also emerged stronger, as well as reduced interest expense on a comparable basis., Investing\\nAhead of Recovery, Emerging Stronger, Comparable Operating Margins, Equity Income, Reduced Interest\\nExpense, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, As a result, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.68 was an increase of 61% year over year. We also delivered strong year-to-date free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, double last year\\'s results. Our cash flow performance has also driven the return of our leverage to within the targeted range of two to two and a half times. Since we reiterated guidance last quarter, the operating environment and our business have clearly improved., Second-Quarter\\nEPS, Year-Over-Year Growth, Free Cash Flow, Leverage Ratio, Business Improvement, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Given the improvement year to date and the increased visibility, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect to deliver year-over-year organic revenue growth of 12% to 14% and comparable EPS growth of 13% to 15% in 2021. Our steady focus on cash generation continues to yield progress, and our updated guidance for free cash flow of at least $9 billion implies a dividend payout ratio significantly improved from where we began the year and is edging closer to our targeted level of 75% over the long term. So as we think about the remainder of the year, a few things to keep in mind., Raising\\nOutlook, Organic Revenue Growth, Comparable EPS Growth, Cash Generation, Dividend Payout Ratio, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The recovery phase continues to be asynchronous, creating a dynamic demand environment, in addition to causing many parts of the supply chain to experience tightness as a result. While experiencing some isolated pressure points, our team is navigating the challenges well through supplier diversification and inventory management. Despite recent upward pressures in many commodities driven by the pandemic-related disruptions, we feel good about the rest of the year. And as we anticipate hedges rolling off in 2022, we are working with our system to take appropriate action in the back half of this year to manage the ongoing volatility using revenue growth management capabilities and supply chain productivity levers., Supply Chain\\nTightness, Inventory Management, Commodity Prices, Revenue Growth Management, Supply Chain\\nProductivity Levers, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, With regard to marketing investment, we have three priorities, increase consumer-facing marketing spend toward levels similar to 2019, improve the quality of that spend and allocate the spend in a more targeted manner. Our currency outlook continues to contemplate a tailwind of 1% to 2% to the top line and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. That said, the currency markets remain volatile and dependent on recovery from the pandemic as well as macroeconomic factors. We will also have some additional timing considerations with the leveling out of our concentrate shipments that are running a bit ahead year to date as well as six fewer days in the fourth quarter., Marketing\\nInvestment, Currency Outlook, Comparable EPS Growth, Timing Considerations, Supply Chain Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, To summarize, our company and our system have tackled many challenges through the pandemic, but we are emerging stronger, thanks to the hard work of our people and the focus on our strategic priorities. With our network organization up and running, we\\'re on a path to operate more efficiently and effectively and to unlock the enormous potential we have in our brands and across our markets. As James mentioned earlier, we remain clear-eyed as we look at the rest of the year with many markets continuing to face obstacles, such as the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, while others continue to see the benefits of reopening. Overall, we are pleased with our progress in the first half of the year, and we\\'re grateful for the commitment from the stakeholders across our ecosystem that contributed to our results., Emerging\\nStronger, Network Organization, Operating Efficiency, Brand Potential, Market Challenges, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, With that operator, we are ready to take questions., Taking\\nQuestions, Operator, Ready, Pandemic, Challenges, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In what remains a highly dynamic environment, our first-quarter results show promising signs that a broader recovery is on the horizon. We\\'re encouraged by early results in markets where mobility is on the rise. This morning, I\\'ll share what we\\'re seeing around the world and provide an update on the actions we\\'ve taken to accelerate our transformation, including improvements in our portfolio, innovation, and marketing approaches, enabled by the evolution of our culture and our network organization., Broader\\nRecovery, Dynamic Environment, Early Results, Transformation, Culture and Network Organization, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Then I\\'ll hand over the call to John to discuss the financial details of the quarter and how we\\'ll continue to deliver on our objectives over the course of the year. In the first quarter, we positioned our business for recovery while executing against our emerging stronger agenda, equipping our system to win. At the start of the year, pandemic-related lockdowns were still impacting many markets. We moved quickly as conditions changed, improving along the way, and getting better at managing each wave and its resulting lockdowns., Financial\\nDetails, Objectives, Pandemic Impact, Recovery Agenda, Emerging Stronger, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, During the quarter, we saw mobility increase in some parts of the world where lockdowns eased and vaccinations accelerated. Leveraging our learnings, we drove sequential improvement in our business throughout the quarter. And while we saw mid-single-digit volume declines through mid-February, trends have improved since then. We\\'re pleased to say that March marked a return to volume levels seen in March of 2019 prior to the pandemic., Mobility\\nIncrease, Business Improvement, Volume Declines, Pandemic Impact, Return to Normal, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to see ongoing strength in at-home channels, offset by away-from-home trends which have improved sequentially but remain pressured relative to pre-pandemic levels. We\\'re working with our customers and bottling partners to sustain at-home momentum and capture improving away-from-home demand. For example, in Latin America, our Prospera program with our bottlers helps the traditional trade thrive through assistance with their marketing efforts, resulting in outperformance in this critical channel. In Great Britain, we launched Open, a business accelerator program to support pubs, bars, and cafes., Ongoing\\nStrength, Away-From-Home Trends, At-Home Momentum, Prospera Program, Open Program, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In North America, our use of mail bundles is driving incidents in pickup and delivery transactions with food service customers. In 2020, we gained underlying share in both at-home and away-from-home channels, offset by negative channel mix. This continues to be the dynamic affecting our share year to date. Through our ongoing initiatives and as away-from-home demand improves over the course of the year, we\\'ll seek to build on these wins in 2021., Mail Bundles,\\nUnderlying Share, Channel Mix, Away-From-Home Demand, Ongoing Initiatives, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, There are clear opportunities to reaccelerate share positions as the recovery plays out and we\\'ll invest to drive momentum with focus and flexibility. In market at the forefront of the recovery, we\\'ve seen early signs that our actions taken during the pandemic are helping us outpace recovery. It\\'s important to note that the path to a full recovery remains asynchronous around the world. Many markets haven\\'t yet turned a corner and are still managing through the restrictions., Recovery,\\nShare Positions, Investment, Market Performance, Global Asynchrony, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Looking around the world, in Asia Pacific, China continues to lead the recovery with volume in the first quarter ahead of 2019 results and foot traffic almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Strong performance in India and Southwest Asia was driven by effective marketing across brands, affordable solutions, and distribution expansion with 250,000 new outlets and 45% more new coolers. Despite the unexpected state of emergency earlier in the year, Japan expands its successful RGM initiatives geographically and across brands to help drive improvements later in the quarter. In EMEA, vaccine rollout in Europe has been slower than anticipated and many countries have been impacted by ongoing lockdowns., Asia Pacific\\nRecovery, China Volume, India Marketing, Southwest Asia Distribution, Japan RGM Initiatives, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Eurasia and the Middle East, brand Coke recruited 4.4 million consumers through affordability packages and a focus on at-home occasions. New marketing campaigns drove improvement in flavored Sparkling soft drinks, and Fuze Tea reached an all-time-high value share in Turkey. In Africa, mass vaccination is expected to take longer than the developed markets. And despite ongoing volatility, Africa worked closely with our bottlers to deliver volume growth that by stepped-up execution through cooler placement and affordability packs like returnable glass bottles., Brand Coke,\\nAffordability Packages, Marketing Campaigns, Flavored Sparkling Soft Drinks, Africa Volume Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In North America, the year is off to a good start. Ongoing strength in at-home channels was driven by core brands in our Sparkling portfolio, as well as Simply, fairlife, and Gold Peak all with encouraging results. Away-from-home began to approve in March as vaccinations and mobility picked up. In Latin America, we leveraged our core brands, digital initiatives, and refill packages to recover ahead of the economy and our industry despite ongoing restrictions., Ongoing\\nStrength, At-Home Channels, Away-From-Home Trends, Latin America Performance, Core Brands, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, While from away-from-home continues to be impacted by lockdowns, we are expanding the at-home consumption opportunity, leveraging consumer dynamics like indulgence of single-serve multi-packs. Global Ventures continue to be impacted by lockdowns in the U.K. But as restrictions loosen, we\\'re focusing on driving digital engagement and traffic back to the cost of the stores. Cost of express machines continue to deliver strong performance., At-Home\\nConsumption, Away-From-Home Impact, Global Ventures Lockdowns, Digital Engagement, Cost of Express\\nMachines, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Turning our transformation, our operating units are up and running and also a very good start in the rollout of our new model. Across markets, our newly networked organization has us working more collaboratively with the overall enterprise in mind. Our operating unit and category leadership teams are working together to identify the most promising combinations across the industry based on economic outlook, consumer trends, channel dynamics, and execution imperatives. We\\'re using more disciplined resource allocation to capture the biggest opportunities, while making ongoing portfolio decisions faster and at scale., Transformation, Operating Units, New Model Rollout, Collaboration, Resource Allocation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re focused on our streamlined growth portfolio, actively and thoughtfully transitioning brands to more powerful trademarks using a phased approach to bring the consumer with us on the journey. And we\\'re maximizing shelf space with new product launches and higher-velocity products to drive higher-quality growth. As we discussed at CAGNY, we\\'re focusing on what we do best: marketing our loved brands in more efficient and effective ways. As \"Sprite., Streamlined\\nGrowth Portfolio, Phased Approach, Shelf Space Optimization, Marketing Efficiency, Brand Focus, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s be clear.\" campaign kicked off in markets from Asia to Africa to Latin America, the message is resonating with consumers with impressions, views, and engagement levels above last year, and intent-to-purchase metrics showing promising signs. This campaign aligns with our transition to a more sustainable clear bottle, which is important in helping us achieve our World Without Waste goals. Our media and creative agency reviews are progressing and we\\'re also executing more targeted opportunities in addition to the big strategic shifts. For instance, we\\'ve taken a scaled, digitized approach to buying trade materials resulting in up to 15% cost reduction and improved user experience, all while offering more consistent, better quality, and sustainable alternatives., Campaign\\nResonation, Sustainability Goals, Media and Creative Agency Reviews, Targeted Opportunities, Cost\\nReduction, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve extended this pool buying opportunity to our bottlers, many of whom are already on board to share the benefits systemwide. Our more disciplined innovation approach is yielding results as we balance big bets with intelligent experimentation. Using our networked approach, we are scaling our best innovations quickly and effectively, while being disciplined with those that don\\'t get the traction required for further investment. Local experiments like Aquarius with functional benefits and Ayataka Cafe Matcha Latte in Japan, Fanta\\'s exciting mystery flavor innovation in Europe, and package innovations like the 13.2-ounce recycled PET bottle in North America could all be lifted and shifted globally over time., Pool Buying\\nOpportunity, Disciplined Innovation, Networked Approach, Global Scaling, Local Experimentation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, It\\'s similar to what we\\'re doing this year with our half-flavored Sparkling water. Our big bets for 2021 include ongoing work to scale our coffee platform under Costa. We\\'re expanding ready-to-drink coffee in China and taking a portfolio approach to complement our powerful Georgia coffee brand in Japan. We\\'re also rolling out an enhanced formula and package designed for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar this month in Europe, in Latin America, and across markets globally later this year., Coffee\\nPlatform, Ready-to-Drink Coffee, Enhanced Formula and Package, Global Rollout, Markets Expansion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The improved recipe brings its taste even close to that of the iconic Coca-Cola original taste. This was influenced by consumer insight and our focus on constant improvement. And despite this enormous success, Coca-Cola Zero sugar still represents a relatively small percentage of the trademark. And we continue to respond to consumer desires for lower-sugar options and the rollout will be supported by global, occasion-based marketing campaign., Improved\\nRecipe, Consumer Insight, Small Percentage, Global Marketing Campaign, Lower-Sugar Options, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, it\\'s early days but we\\'re excited to come back and report on our expanded experimentation in flavored alcoholic beverages with Topo Chico hard seltzer in Latin America, Europe, and most recently, the U.S. We also continue to rapidly digitize our ecosystem. For example, a champ born in South Africa engages with consumers on social media to increase away-from-home transactions. In China, we\\'ve used digital campaigns to harness consumer data to drive traffic and incidents leading to incremental growth., Topo Chico\\nHard Seltzer, Expanded Experimentation, Digitalization, Social Media Engagement, Incremental Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re using machine learning and AI tools to stay on top of a rapidly evolving consumer trends and identify emerging needs. Our dedicated digital transformation structure is leading to strong online to offline growth. We\\'ve seen e-commerce share gains in a key advanced markets like North America, Japan, and Great Britain. And in markets like Turkey, where the channel is still developing with more than tripled sales and gained almost 10 points of share versus last year., Machine\\nLearning, AI Tools, Digital Transformation, E-Commerce Share Gains, Offline Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As always, we\\'re supporting these initiatives with strong revenue growth management and execution. Through RGM, we continue to capture at-home occasions with multi-pack options in both premium and affordable segments, while expanding distribution of smaller packaging like our sleek cans in China. And we have affordability plays like our successful refillables in Latin America, the Philippines, and now Africa. As part of our new organization, we\\'re dedicating more resources to RGM, continuing to raise the bar to even higher standards., Revenue Growth\\nManagement, Execution, At-Home Occasions, Affordable Segments, Affordability Plays, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In many markets, we\\'re working with our bottling partners to optimize cooler placement, driving incremental volume through outstanding customer service, our cooler productivity, and innovation. Our bottling partners are executing strongly. And together, we are working on initiatives across the enterprise to identify more efficiencies. We\\'re operating in a networked way, leveraging our platform services organization to scale our collective data, marketing, digital, and supply chain capabilities., Optimizing\\nCooler Placement, Incremental Volume, Customer Service, Cooler Productivity, Networked Way, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our system continues to evolve as shown by the pending combination of Coca-Cola European partners and Coca-Cola Amatil. And just this morning, we announced our intent to list Coca-Cola Beverages Africa as an independent African bottler through an initial public offering. I\\'m especially proud of how we are delivering on our purpose as a company. Every action is guided by our ambition to create a more sustainable business and better shared future that makes a difference in people\\'s lives, our communities, and the planet., Pending\\nCombination, Initial Public Offering, Purpose of Company, Sustainability, Better Shared Future, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Throughout the pandemic, we\\'ve focused on helping communities through relief funds from the company and the Coca-Cola Foundation. In this next phase, we are supporting vaccination efforts in regions where distribution has been slower. For instance, in Brazil, our system has partnered with the country\\'s Ministry of Health to co-create a vaccine awareness campaign. We\\'re using our network to deliver 700,000 doses with vaccine information to more than 350,000 mom-and-pop stores., Vaccination\\nEfforts, Relief Funds, Coca-Cola Foundation, Vaccine Awareness Campaign, Mom-and-Pop Stores, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tomorrow, we\\'ll release our 2020 business and ESG report, where we will highlight last year\\'s progress. While 2020 was a milestone year in terms of meeting and exceeding some previous goals like women\\'s empowerment and global water replenishment, we continue to work toward an even more ambitious agenda. This includes our 2025 and 2030 packaging goals, our 2030 climate goal, and our new 2030 water security strategy with more details to come later this year. In conclusion, we\\'re optimistic about the future and bullish about our ability to continue to deliver on the objectives we laid out at the height of the crisis: more consumers, more share, better system economics, and a positive stakeholder impact., 2020 Business\\nand ESG Report, Progress, Ambitious Agenda, Packaging Goals, Climate Goal, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, I\\'ll turn the call to John to discuss how we\\'re delivering results through a continued dynamic environment., Delivering\\nResults, Dynamic Environment, Turn to John, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and good morning to everybody on the call. Today, I will highlight our first-quarter performance and go over our top-line and earnings guidance, which we are reiterating. Then I\\'ll provide a progress update on working capital, our ability to manage through the current commodity environment, and other factors that may impact our outlook. 2021 is off to a good start, with the quarter showing steady sequential monthly improvement., First-Quarter\\nPerformance, Top-Line and Earnings Guidance, Working Capital Management, Commodity Environment,\\nProgress Update, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re leveraging our learnings and strategic initiatives from 2020 and leaning into growth in a thoughtful way. Our Q1 organic revenue was up 6%, driven by concentrate shipments up 5% and price/mix improvement of 1%. While shipments benefited from certain timing impacts and the five additional days this quarter versus last year, unit case volume was flat versus the toughest quarterly compare of 2020, and March volume was in line with 2019 levels, largely driven by strength in Asia Pacific. Comparable gross margins, although still down year over year, improved sequentially, driven by less pressure from channel and package mix., Learnings from\\n2020, Growth Strategy, Organic Revenue, Shipments, Comparable Gross Margins, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, While currency was still somewhat of a drag, it was less of a headwind than prior quarters. Comparable operating margin expanded through ongoing disciplined cost management. We continue to reintroduce marketing spend in a targeted way, particularly as we ramp up investments in markets that are seeing recovery. First-quarter comparable EPS of $0.55 is an increase of 8% year over year and was driven by top-line growth, margin improvement, and some contribution from equity income, offset by currency headwinds., Currency\\nImpact, Comparable Operating Margin, Marketing Spend, First-Quarter EPS, Equity Income, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Regarding our ongoing tax case with the IRS, there are no material updates since our last report. Our decisions and actions from last year certainly were not easy, but we are seeing the results of our efforts start to come through, and our organization is embracing the changes as we move forward into the recovery phase. We stayed very focused on driving a healthy top line, and we remain on a journey to maximize returns, including strong cash flow generation. We never relented on our cash flow goals and, indeed, have had an even sharper focus on managing capital spend and working capital., Tax Case,\\nOrganization Embracing Changes, Top-Line Focus, Cash Flow Goals, Working Capital Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Since we embarked on a journey toward best-in-class working capital performance, we\\'ve made great strides in extending our payment terms, generating a working capital improvement of more than $1 billion over two years. In the same vein, we are implementing accounts receivables factoring programs, which are rolling out across a number of markets, and also looking at initiatives to better manage inventory days. At the center of these efforts is a robust digitization and automation agenda. In addition, and you\\'ve heard us talk conceptually about the network model, this is a great example of the network in action., Working\\nCapital Performance, Payment Terms, Accounts Receivables Factoring Programs, Inventory Management,\\nDigitization and Automation Agenda, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, And when you put the right people from different parts of the organization against key initiatives, it delivers a step-change in performance. Last quarter, we said that despite a rising commodity environment, we expected a relatively benign impact in 2021 given our hedged positions. While this continues to be the case, we\\'re closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs such as high-fructose corn syrup, PET, metals, and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners. Given the environment, we\\'ll continue to benefit from revenue growth management initiatives., Right People,\\nKey Initiatives, Commodity Environment, Revenue Growth Management, Benefits, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Through an intelligently diverse price pack architecture, we can produce a range of options that meet the needs of consumers across the income spectrum while also capturing value for customers. 2020 provided great learnings on how to be more logical and data-driven in our promotions, and we\\'ll continue to be purposeful in our approach, driven by the consumer and the strength of our brands. We\\'ll also continue to pursue productivity across the supply chain, pushing all levers at our disposal. Since we last provided guidance, the U.S., Price Pack\\nArchitecture, Data-Driven Promotions, Supply Chain Productivity, Consumer Needs, Brand Strength, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, dollar has strengthened. And as we noted in our release, we now expect currency to be a tailwind of approximately 1% to 2% to the top line and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. For the full year, we now expect an underlying effective tax rate of 19.1%. Putting it all together, our quarterly performance and the momentum we saw in March give us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2021 guidance., Currency\\nImpact, Tax Rate, Quarterly Performance, Guidance, Momentum, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We expect high single-digit organic revenue growth and high single-digit to low double-digit growth in comparable earnings per share. We still expect recovery to be asynchronous and to see signs of a return to normal in more markets later in 2021. We are preparing our end-to-end supply chain for stronger demand and will fuel the momentum in recovering markets as they emerge from the pandemic by accelerating investments in our brands. There\\'s no doubt that uncertainty remains., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Comparable Earnings Per Share, Recovery Timeline, Supply Chain Investments,\\nUncertainty, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Europe continues to see challenges. Many countries in regions like Latin America and Africa expect further waves and slower vaccine distribution. And India is seeing a surge in cases and responding with localized lockdowns. But as we begin to lap the most difficult periods from last year, we feel good about our position and our ability to navigate the environment as a company and as a system., European\\nChallenges, Latin American and African Regions, India\\'s Cases and Lockdowns, Company Navigation,\\nEnvironmental Position, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2021, 1, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Based on the lessons we\\'ve learned and the agility provided by our new network organization, we remain confident that our actions and the progress we\\'ve made will enable us to deliver 2021 earnings at or above 2019 levels. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions., Confidence,\\nLessons Learned, Agility, Progress, Earnings, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I\\'d like to begin today\\'s call by reflecting on the past year including our fourth-quarter performance. Then let\\'s turn the page and look at the new year. I\\'ll provide thoughts on the current environment and how we will continue to manage through near-term volatility., Reflection,\\nFourth-Quarter Performance, New Year, Environmental Management, Volatility, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Finally, I will share how we are thinking about the year ahead and why we remain confident about the future. John will then discuss the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Now, before we dive in, I\\'d like to address our U.S. income tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service including both the case and the opinion that was issued by the U.S., U.S. Income\\nTax Dispute, Internal Revenue Service, Case and Opinion, Future Confidence, Quarterly Outlook, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Tax Court in November. We believe that the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in its conclusions. We intend to assert our claims on appeal and vigorously defend our position. We\\'ve consulted with outside advisors and conducted comprehensive analyses., Tax Court,\\nAppeal, Position Defense, Consultation, Analyses, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve considered all relevant information including the unconstitutionality of the IRS\\'s retroactive imposition of tax liability. Putting this all together, we believe we will ultimately prevail on appeal. John will provide insight into the range of risks we see should the case not go in our favor. I also encourage you to refer to Exhibit 99.2 in the Form 8-K we filed this morning for the update and disclosure., Prevail on\\nAppeal, Risk Management, Unconstitutionality, Tax Liability, Exhibit 99.2, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The tax matter is clearly important and we are dedicating ample resources to its resolution but it is likely to take some time. We remain steadfastly focused on delivering growth in our business and driving long-term value for our stakeholders. In 2020, we faced significant challenges posed by the global pandemic. Our company proved resilient moving with agility to adapt our business and accelerate our strategic transformation., Tax Matter,\\nResource Dedication, Business Growth, Long-term Value, Global Pandemic, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Our work isn\\'t done and I recognize and appreciate the ongoing support, dedication, and progress from our people and our system. Turning to the fourth quarter, we saw improving trends through November but a resurgence in the virus drove renewed lockdowns in many parts of the world. The rise in restrictions impacted our recovery in many markets resulting in a modest deceleration in volume in December which has continued year to date with volume currently down mid-single digits. Speaking generally, trends are still tied to our exposure to away-from-home, coupled with the level of lockdown., Improving\\nTrends, Fourth Quarter, Volume Deceleration, Lockdowns, Exposure to Away-from-Home, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, But our business has become more durable compared to the spring of 2020 based on the learnings and actions we have taken. Our teams around the world have applied these learnings from the peak of the crisis to better navigate short-term setbacks. Globally in the fourth quarter, progress remained mixed and even within regions, there was ongoing recovery as well as challenges. For example, in Asia Pacific, countries are at different stages., Business\\nDurability, Team Learnings, Global Progress, Short-term Setbacks, Regional Recovery, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, In China, we are indeed emerging stronger thanks to our strategic actions with Q4 share gains to complement our 2020 share gains in both on and off-premise. Japan drove incremental transactions through their price pack decoupling, but soft traffic in vending continued to pressure mix. In India, challenges remain, but at-home trends were strong and we saw signs of recovery in away-from-home channels through the holidays. EMEA showed resilience despite experiencing varying levels of lockdown through the quarter, driving a dispersion in results between developed and developing markets., China, Japan,\\nIndia, EMEA, Lockdowns, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Western Europe was the most affected by the resurgence while West Africa and Turkey showed positive momentum. In North America, away-from-home volumes were impacted by multiple states restricting bars and banning in-door dining. Sparkling water trends remained robust with the expansion of AHA and Topo Chico mineral water, as well as Simply and Fair Life also performing well. In Latin America, trends were strong early in the quarter but slowed in December due to restrictions and less stimulus support., Western\\nEurope, North America, Away-from-Home, Sparkling Water, Latin America, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, single-serve is recovering as a percent of mix in our business and multi-serve refillables grew at a double-digit pace. Brazil\\'s results remained strong and Mexico improved sequentially. In Global ventures, despite the headwind of renewed U.K. lockdowns impacting our Costa retail stores, express machines performed well., Single-serve,\\nMulti-serve, Brazil, Mexico, Global Ventures, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We continued expansion in China, Japan, and further into Europe, and are testing Express and Proud to Serve platforms, along with the launch of costacofee.com in the U.S. Our bottling investment group further improved operating margin performance and made progress on cooler productivity and SKU rationalization. Almost all markets gained or maintained share with Vietnam achieving its highest-ever sparkling share. From a category perspective, we saw relative outperformance for sparkling in the fourth quarter., China, Japan,\\nEurope, Sparkling, Bottling Investment Group, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Trademark Coke delivered 1% volume growth, delivered by our zero-sugar offerings which were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. While our overall market share performance continued to be impacted by channel mix as our higher-share away-from-home business remains pressured, we did gain underlying value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. We are poised to emerge stronger in both channels due to our actions to support customers and to ensure seamless execution from a supply chain perspective. Thinking about 2021, there is no doubt the near-term trajectory of our recovery will still be impacted by the presence of the virus in most markets., Trademark\\nCoke, Volume Growth, Market Share, Supply Chain, Virus Impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, It is still early days in the vaccination process and we\\'d expect to see further improvements in our business as vaccinations become more widely available over the coming months. It\\'s clear that the pace and availability of vaccines will look different around the world and therefore will likely see some level of asynchronous recovery depending both on vaccine distribution and other macro-economic factors. Amidst this backdrop, we will ensure that the system remains flexible to adjust to near-term uncertainties, while at the same time continue to push forward on initiatives, we have championed to emerge stronger. So, let me touch briefly on our progress against several initiatives today and we\\'ll provide further detail on these as well as other important business drivers at our virtual CAGNY presentation next week., Vaccination,\\nRecovery, Macro-Economic Factors, Initiatives, CAGNY Presentation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Our network organization is coming together in creating empowerment through clear decision rights and accountability.

Our long-term profitable growth will be powered by our optimized brand portfolio. We streamlined our portfolio from 400 to 200 master brands, allowing global category teams to identify the greatest opportunities and allocate investments accordingly. These targeted investments will leverage our leader brands more effectively and convert challenger and explorer brands into leaders more quickly and consistently., Diverse and\\nEquitable Representation, Long-term Profitable Growth, Optimized Brand Portfolio, Global Category\\nTeams, Targeted Investments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Additionally, our portfolio of streamlining allows us to focus attention and resources on what we do best.

Great brand building begins with a deep understanding of our consumer that converts into superior, quality products., Brand\\nBuilding, Innovation, Consumer Understanding, Quality Products, Focus and Resources, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, To enhance our marketing effectiveness, we are building targeted, experiential campaigns that are data-driven and occasion-based, and always on. We are eager to share upcoming work generated by this new marketing model including our first-ever global Sprite campaign, it\\'s called Let\\'s Be Clear. It invites drinkers to reset and refresh.

We have a global creative and media agency review under way which will improve processes, eliminate duplication, and drive efficiency to fuel reinvestment in our brands. Our innovation pipeline for 2021 has been shaped and coordinated for scale and impact. Consists of global bets like the new taste and design for Coke Zero Sugar and regional bets across categories like the expansion of our authentic teahouse franchise across Asia., Optimizing Marketing Spend, Global Creative and Media Agency Review, Innovation\\nPipeline, Strongest Brands, Regional Bets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re still pursuing intelligent local experimentation like adding functional benefits to some of our local hydration brands. And there\\'s also innovation that leverages our strength in revenue growth management through packaging initiatives. This includes our first 100%-recycled PET bottles in the U.S. for Smartwater and Dasani, along with a new 13.2-ounce, 100%-recycled PET bottle for trademark Coca-Cola., Intelligent\\nLocal Experimentation, Innovation through Revenue Growth Management, Packaging Initiatives, Strength\\nin Recycled PET Bottles, First 100%-recycled PET Bottles, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We will also continue to expand Topo Chico hard seltzer which has already launched in several cities in Latin America and Europe. The global pandemic has undoubtedly expedited the shift to a digital world and we are structuring the organization around this opportunity. We\\'ve been digitizing the enterprise for several years and have stepped up our evolution into an organization that can skillfully execute marketing, commercial, sales, and distribution both offline and online. We\\'re also leveraging existing pockets of excellence in e-commerce around the globe., Topo Chico\\nHard Seltzer, Global Pandemic, Digital World, Organization Structure, E-Commerce, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, for myCoke B2B platform continues to add outlets and is expanding to new markets.

Bottler alignment also remains an imperative, seamless system connectivity helps us maintain the local relevance while benefiting from a global scale. We continue to engage with our bottling partners holistically to fuel the network for long-term growth. We\\'re working to lift and shift capabilities, we can focus on being successful today, while also pursuing our ambitions for the future., Ecosystem,\\nBottler Alignment, System Connectivity, Long-Term Growth, Capability Lift and Shift, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, And before I turn over to John, I want to express how proud I am of our support for communities and our sustainability achievements during a year that brought much disruption to the world. We remain grounded by our purpose and our ESG work is embedded in our business and the value we create. We contributed to COVID-19 relief around the world. We continue to focus on racial equity including the introduction of our global social justice framework., Purpose, ESG Work, COVID-19 Relief, Racial Equity, Global Social Justice Framework, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve made progress against priorities such as World Without Waste which includes setting a new target to reduce the use of virgin PET in our packaging. We\\'re also making progress against our 2030 science-based carbon target which is a critical milestone to achieving our ambition to be net-zero carbon by 2050.

And we won\\'t stop there., World Without\\nWaste, Carbon Target, Empowering Women, Shared Value, Net-Zero Carbon by 2050, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll have more updates in our business and sustainability report and World Without Waste report in the coming months. To summarize, we are confident that we will successfully navigate through a dynamic market environment in 2021 to deliver against our objectives. We\\'ll emerge stronger with more consumers, higher share, stronger system economics, and greater stakeholder impact. As vaccine distributions continue, we have more visibility into how the global recovery will take shape., 2021 Market\\nEnvironment, Objectives, Vaccine Distributions, Global Recovery, Stakeholder Impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, James Quincey, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, And given our confidence in the levers, we have to manage the business, we are providing an outlook for 2021. Importantly, we\\'re staying true to our commitment to consumer centricity and our Beverages for Life strategy. We\\'ve made great progress in equipping the company to win for years to come as we will fulfill our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. Now, John will provide more details on our results and our guidance., Consumer\\nCentricity, Beverages for Life Strategy, Purpose, Refreshing the World, Making a Difference, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\\'ll go over our fourth-quarter performance and touch on the components of our outlook for 2021. First, let me start with a comment on the tax case that James referred to earlier in the call. As he mentioned, we disagree with the U.S., Tax Case,\\nFourth-Quarter Performance, Outlook for 2021, Refusal of Disagreement, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Tax Court opinion and will vigorously defend our position. In the Form 8-K filed this morning, we provided detail on the process we\\'ve undergone in arriving at our current position and determining next steps. Thorough analysis has led us to believe we will ultimately be successful. And while we have recorded a tax reserve of $438 million in consideration of the alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied by the courts in resolving the litigated matters, we have not made any changes to our underlying effective tax rate going forward., Tax Court\\nOpinion, Position Defense, Determining Next Steps, Tax Reserve, Underlying Effective Tax Rate, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, That said, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the company\\'s favor. It is possible that all or some portion of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and affirmed by the Tax Court could be upheld. To this end, we have estimated approximately $12 billion for the aggregate incremental tax liability for years up to and including 2020, including interests accrued through December 31, 2020. This amount assumes the IRS prevails and apply their methodology and considers any adjustments from previously accrued transition tax payable under the tax cuts and JOBS Act of 2017., Tax Liability,\\nEstimation, Aggregate Incremental Tax Liability, Years Up to and Including 2020, IRS Prevails, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, We have also indicated that applying their methodology would increase our underlying effective tax rate by approximately 3.5%. There are many puts and takes that informed the range of incremental liability and potential change in tax rate. I encourage you to refer to the disclosure in the Form 8-K for more in-depth details. While there is uncertainty associated with the timing and ultimate resolution, we will continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long-term growth, as well as supporting dividend growth for our shareowners., Uncertainty,\\nInvestment Prioritization, Dividend Growth, Long-term Growth, Tax Rate, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, While we strongly believe we will prevail, we are confident we have ample flexibility between our cash generation and balance sheet to manage the range of outcomes outlined in this morning\\'s disclosure. We will be as transparent as possible throughout this process. Turning to our performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal-year 2020. Our Q4 organic revenue decline of 3% showed sequential improvement from the 6% decline in the third quarter and 9% decline for the full year., Confidence,\\nFlexibility, Transparency, Performance (Q4 Organic Revenue Decline), Full-Year Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, October and November volumes were down low-single digits and approaching flat year-over-year trends. But as James mentioned, we saw a slowdown in December due to a resurgence in the virus and increased lockdown restrictions in many markets. The contraction in the comparable gross margin was primarily driven by continued pressure on our channel and packaged mix between away-from-home and at-home, as well as currency headwinds. Additionally, segment mix swung to a headwind in the quarter due to outperformance of our bottling investments group., October and\\nNovember Volumes, December Slowdown, Comparable Gross Margin, Channel and Packaged Mix, Segment Mix, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comparable operating margin expanded through ongoing disciplined cost management more than offsetting pressure from the top line. It\\'s worth noting the decline in SG&A spend this quarter was impacted by timing due to the phasing effect of marketing reduction over the year. As we\\'ve previously stated, we have been reintroducing marketing spend in a targeted way, identifying compelling opportunities to invest across countries, categories, and brands. Fourth-quarter comparable EPS of $0.47 represents an increase of 6%, and full-year comparable earnings of $1.95 reflects an 8% decline relative to our 2019 results., Comparable\\nOperating Margin, Ongoing Disciplined Cost Management, SG&A Spend Phasing Effect, Targeted Marketing\\nSpend, Full-Year Comparable EPS, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, On a comparable currency-neutral basis, earnings were up 14% for the quarter and down 2% for the year. Throughout the crisis, we have remained intensely focused on our cash flow goals. While our cash from operations was down 6% for the year, we have continued to make good progress on our working capital and have exercised tight management of our capital spend. This is exemplified by our 2020 free cash flow performance coming off strong momentum in 2019., Comparable\\nCurrency-Neutral Basis, Earnings Growth, Crisis Focus, Cash Flow Goals, Working Capital Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, We finished up 3% for the year and reached free cash flow conversion of over 100% despite the headwinds our business faced. As we begin to see prospects for a recovery later in 2021 driven by vaccination and consumers returning to many of their previous routines, socializing, work, and travel, our focus would be on converting top-line growth to maximize returns. Our improving level of visibility into recovery as the year goes on, as well as the many lessons we\\'ve learned in the last year, have enabled us to provide an outlook for 2021. We currently expect organic revenue percentage growth of high single-digits and comparable earnings per share percentage growth of high single to low double-digits versus 2020., Top-Line\\nGrowth, Free Cash Flow Conversion, Recovery Prospects, Visibility into Recovery, Outlook for 2021, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, While we are confident we will see recovery this year and expect to deliver 2021 earnings that are as or above 2019 levels, we\\'ve provided a wider range than usual to account for lingering uncertainty in the near term, as well as the potential for the acceleration to be asynchronous in nature. There are many considerations as you think about the drivers of our guidance. A calendar shift will impact the quarterly cadence as we have five additional days in the first quarter and six fewer days in the fourth quarter of this year. The trajectory of the recovery will be a significant factor, and we expect to be dealing with COVID-19 for the better part of the year, with the first half likely to be more challenging than the second half., Confidence in\\nRecovery, Wider Guidance Range, Calendar Shift, Trajectory of Recovery, COVID-19 Impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Currently, year-to-date volume is down mid single-digits as we lack the toughest quarterly comparison of 2020 before the pandemic hit much of the world. For this reason that the top line is driven by away-from-home recovery. We\\'d expect the channel and package pressures experienced last year to abate which would drive price mix improvement and gross margin expansion. From a cost perspective, we see several factors at play., Year-to-Date\\nVolume, Away-from-Home Recovery, Channel and Package Pressures, Cost Perspective, Gross Margin\\nExpansion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, In 2020, there were many operating expenses that were significantly reduced or eliminated that are likely to come back this year. We will continue to set off levels of investment behind our brands to drive the top line. We expect the return on that spend to become more favorable as mobility stabilizes and away-from-home channels regain momentum. The changes we are driving with our strategic transformation will lead to more efficient and productive spending over time., Operating\\nExpenses, Brand Investment, Mobility Stabilization, Away-from-Home Channels, Strategic\\nTransformation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, These changes include our organizational restructuring, streamlined portfolio, disciplined innovation, and optimized marketing approach. We will continue to flex our stand relative to what is dictated by the market conditions around us. While we are seeing commodity prices begin to rise, given our heads positions, we currently expect the impact to cost of goods sold to be benign. As we noted in our release, based on current spot rates and our heads positions, we expect currency to be a tailwind of approximately 2% to 3% to the top line and approximately 3% to 4% to comparable EPS in 2021., Organizational\\nRestructuring, Streamlined Portfolio, Disciplined Innovation, Optimized Marketing Approach, Currency\\nImpact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, We will continue to focus on free cash flow and expect to deliver at least $10 billion in cash for operations while we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. This does not contemplate any payment relating to the tax case. We look forward to providing more insight into the drivers of our outlook during our virtual CAGNY presentation next week. In the face of this global pandemic, I am extremely grateful for our team around the world and the way they were able to pivot and execute to such a challenging environment., Free Cash\\nFlow, Capital Expenditures, Tax Case, Virtual CAGNY Presentation, Global Pandemic, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 4, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, I\\'m also excited about the work we\\'ve undertaken to set us up for a very promising future. I am confident that our overall strategic direction will enable us to deliver 2021 earnings that are as or above 2019 levels as we emerge stronger. With that, Operator, we are ready to take Q&A., Strategic\\nDirection, 2021 Earnings, Future Growth, Emergence Stronger, Q&A, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks Tim, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, we saw ongoing improvement and progress. While our business continued to be affected by lockdowns in some markets, especially in places with strong exposure to the away-from-home channels, we are encouraged by the response and execution of our system. Together with our bottlers, we continue to focus on winning as the world reopens., Ongoing\\nImprovement, Progress, Lockdowns, Away-from-Home Channels, Focus on Winning, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve moved quickly to address the near-term realities, and we are working to deliver on the priorities we outlined in our second-quarter call. I\\'m also inspired each and every day by what I see from our associates, their resilience, their drive and their pride in this great system. They\\'re working purposefully to serve our consumers and customers, and to do it safely. They are making a difference in the communities around the world., Addressing\\nNear-Term Realities, Priorities Outlined, Associates\\' Resilience, Safe Service, Making a Difference, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And for this and much more, I offer my sincerest thanks and appreciation. Today, I\\'ll provide an update on the quarter including where we\\'re seeing the most improvements in our business and where recovery is moving at slow pace. Also, I\\'ll share some thoughts on the remainder of the year and as we look forward to 2021. Then I\\'ll share progress we\\'re already making to emerge stronger., Quarterly\\nUpdate, Business Improvements, Recovery, Remainder of Year, Emergence Stronger, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And finally, I\\'ll hand over to John to discuss the quarter in more detail including how we continue to execute in this challenging environment. In the third quarter, we continued to rebound from the pressures we experienced at the peak of the lockdown as the world generally moves into the recovery phase. That said, the trajectory of our business trends continue to be closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of the lockdowns in the market. From the 25% volume decline that we saw in April, the mid-single-digit declines through the summer and the low single-digit decline since September, our volume trends have continued to improve., Quarterly\\nUpdate, Business Execution, Recovery Phase, Away-from-Home Business, Volume Trends, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Much of the sequential improvement has been driven by the away-from-home channels which represent roughly half of our business globally. Our away-from-home volume was down in the mid-teens in the quarter, a significant improvement from the April lows which approached 50% declines. This was driven by the agility of our sales teams throughout the system and the efforts to create value for our customers during the gradual reopening phase. We are seeing the away-from-home recovery starting to stabilize given the ongoing restrictions in many regions., Away-from-Home\\nChannels, Volume Declines, Sales Agility, Customer Value, Stabilizing Recovery, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our at-home channels also saw an acceleration throughout the quarter. Specifically, grocery and e-commerce channels continue to experience solid demand, benefiting both from shifts in consumer behavior and our system\\'s actions to capture those opportunities. The system is working jointly to manage the supply and distribution shifts, make key decisions around portfolio priorities and leverage digital data to identify new outlets to further growth. We continue to see progress, but the environment remains dynamic, and it is not a straight-line recovery around the world, different markets are seeing varying degrees of impact., At-Home\\nChannels, Demand Acceleration, Grocery Channels, E-Commerce Channels, Dynamic Environment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In EMEA, at-home channels continued to perform well, and sparkling soft drinks and juices remained resilient. Volume improved in away-from-home channels throughout the quarter as activities resumed with limitations. In Latin America, volume improved as government restrictions eased. Specifically, Brazil continues to be an outperformer., At-Home\\nChannels, Away-from-Home Channels, Volume Improvement, EMEA Performance, Latin America Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, But economic pressures remain, and our recovery in Mexico has been slower than expected. Moving to North America. Strong performance in at-home channels was offset by continued softness in our Foodservice business. While some away-from-home channels have been slower to recover, we benefited from traffic improvements in channels like convenience retail and quick service restaurants., Economic\\nPressures, Mexico Recovery, North America Performance, At-Home Channels, Foodservice Business, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Importantly, digital partnerships with restaurants and aggregators to optimize menus have resulted in a four point increase in attachment rates. And digital commerce retail sales have more than doubled year to date, outpacing the category. In Asia Pacific, China is well on its way to emerge stronger driven by solid performance in sparkling\\'s soft drinks. Recovery efforts in India and Japan continue, and we have seen meaningful improvement in the face of ongoing restrictions., Digital\\nPartnerships, Attachment Rates, Digital Commerce, Asia Pacific Performance, Recovery Efforts, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Global ventures remains pressured but has seen a significant improvement from Q2, with organic revenues improving by over 30 points. Our Costa retail stores, one of the most affected parts of our company at the peak of the global lockdowns, are now almost entirely open. While traffic is unlikely to fully recover in the near term, our First One on Us campaign has shown promising signs, driving over one million new consumers to the Costa app. We continue our journey to be a global, multi-platform coffee company under the Costa brand., Global\\nVentures, Organic Revenues, Costa Retail Stores, First One on Us Campaign, Multi-Platform Coffee\\nCompany, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Across our channels and regions, our brand portfolio is working hard to return to pre-COVID levels of growth, and we have made progress in the quarter. For example, trademark Coke delivered volume growth in Q3. We also saw growth in local champions like Simply and fairlife in the U.S., and Thums Up in India. With the NARTD category continuing to be affected by a shift to at-home channels, our underlying strength in value share this quarter was more than offset by the negative mix in away-from-home, where we tend to have stronger share positions., Brand\\nPortfolio, Volume Growth, Trademark Coke, Local Champions, NARTD Category, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Clicking down, we are seeing positive share momentum in EMEA and Latin America including gains in sparkling soft drinks. In fact, trademark Coca-Cola saw share gains in 80% of our top markets globally this quarter. Share gains are a key metric of our determination to emerge stronger, and we are intent on recapturing lost ground and more through the recovery phase. In summary, we are encouraged by the improvement in our business., Positive Share\\nMomentum, EMEA Performance, Latin America Performance, Trademark Coca-Cola, Global Share Gains, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, However, it\\'s important to remember the world is in a fragile state. We\\'ve seen reopening trends begin to moderate, and the away-from-home recovery showed signs of stalling in September with the increase of restrictions in several markets. There is potential for increased regional lockdowns as we enter colder seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. We don\\'t expect to return to the peak levels of global lockdown, but we are prepared for setbacks due to the local spikes in cases and targeted restrictions and closures., Fragile State,\\nAway-From-Home Recovery, Regional Lockdowns, Cold Seasons, Global Lockdown Peak, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The pandemic has been a catalyst for change for our company, but the initial work behind our strategic transformation was in motion for some time before the crisis hit. We\\'ve been challenging legacy ways of doing business, and the pandemic helped us realize we could be bolder in our efforts. Last quarter, we highlighted five priorities to accelerate our transformation. We set out to optimize our portfolio and instill more discipline in our innovation approach, coupled with more effective marketing, stepped-up revenue growth management and execution, and enhanced system collaboration., Strategic\\nTransformation, Legacy Ways of Doing Business, Pandemic Impact, Priorities for Acceleration,\\nPortfolio Optimization, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We also said we\\'ll evolve our organization and invest in capabilities to ensure we can bring the strategy to life. We\\'re moving swiftly to deliver against those priorities with our goal to reach pre-COVID growth levels ahead of the economic recovery. Firstly, we set out to position our portfolio for success, focusing on scaled growth through targeted resource allocation and optimization. Over the past few months, a cross-functional team has worked to identify the right brands for a growth portfolio that will drive quality leadership and help us achieve our beverages for life ambitions., Organization\\nEvolution, Capabilities Investment, Portfolio Positioning, Resource Allocation, Growth Ambitions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We have finalized the master brands in this growth portfolio which consists of about 200 global, regional and local brands that will allow us to remain truly consumer-centric, focusing on those brands that can be scaled to drive profits for the long term. For the brands who are not selected, we have begun the work with our bottlers to quickly sunset or thoughtfully transition them to one of the growth brands over the next year. Secondly, our marketing transformation is also under way. We have undertaken a global initiative to improve marketing efficiency and effectiveness, jointly led by our marketing, procurement and finance teams., Growth\\nPortfolio, Master Brands, Marketing Transformation, Brand Selection, Sunsetting Brands, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This is a top priority, and the initial work to date has validated the opportunity to sustainably reduce our spend via proven procurement methodologies and other efficiency levers, while maintaining and improving marketing effectiveness. Importantly, this is not a top-down-driven exercise to reduce expenses. There is no savings target. Rather, by improving our processes, eliminating duplication and optimizing spend on things like third-party agencies, we will increase our effectiveness and be able to fuel reinvestment in our brands., Priority,\\nProcurement Methodologies, Efficiency Levers, Marketing Effectiveness, Reinvestment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, When it comes to innovation, we\\'re focusing on bigger, more scalable bets. And to be clear, this strategy does not mean less innovation overall. Already, this mindset is showing results. Year to date, revenue contribution from innovation is higher than last year and the amount of revenue per innovation has doubled., Bigger Bets,\\nScalable Innovation, Revenue Contribution, Innovation Mindset, Doubled Revenue, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Innovation will come in different forms. We can leverage a trademark to expand the category, like we\\'re doing with Coke Energy. We can also create a brand like AHA to participate in a growing category or subcategory. And we can also expand our addressable market by entering a new category like we\\'ve done so with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer which debuted last month in select cities across Latin America, with more markets coming soon including the U.S., Innovation\\nForms, Trademark Expansion, Brand Creation, Addressable Market Expansion, New Category Entry, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ultimately, we\\'re combining discipline with agility to win drinkers, share and profits. We continue to experiment on a local level, and our new approach allows us to move faster to find and scale our best initiatives. We have a robust pipeline in the works for next year and expect innovation to continue to contribute meaningfully to our growth going forward. And as we adapt our organization, we continue to apply our enhanced revenue growth management capabilities, provide beverage options at the right price and for the occasion consumers are looking for, and to bring new drinkers to our brands., Combining\\ndiscipline with agility, Experimentation, Pipeline for next year, Organizational adaptation, Revenue\\ngrowth management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are also strengthening our bottling partnerships across the system to enhance execution across channels. In order to ensure the structure of our company facilitates the success of our accelerated strategy, we\\'re becoming a more networked organization that will combine the power of scale with deep knowledge to win locally. We expect this new networked model to be established and functioning at the beginning of the next year, and platform services will be fully integrated, standardized and scaled over the course of next year. We\\'re streamlining from 17 business units to nine operating units which will accelerate decision-making while maintaining local market execution., Strengthening bottling partnerships, New networked organization, Establishment of platform\\nservices, Streamlining business units, Accelerated decision-making, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve announced five global category leads to steer the new marketing model and ensure relentless consumer focus on brands that can be scaled to even stronger positions. We\\'re also creating a new platform services organization which will be a critical enabler in supporting a networked web-working. It will be a collection of 10 areas of expertise, known as hubs, that will partner with the operating units, categories and the center to develop capabilities and services needed to support their strategies, as well as enable collaboration and execution. Our people are confident and engaged in this transformation and an enterprise mindset is taking hold., New\\nmarketing model, Platform services organization, Hubs of expertise, Enterprise mindset,\\nTransformation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our new leadership teams have been formed, and there are clear job descriptions to ensure accountability across functions. The changes to our structure will result in reallocation and a reduction in the number of associates. This is under way through a combination of voluntary separation programs as well as some level of involuntary reductions. Although these changes are never easy, I am certain they will allow us to emerge stronger., Leadership teams, Job descriptions, Structural changes, Reallocation, Reduction in number of\\nassociates, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In addition to executing on the five priorities, environmental, social and governance initiatives always remain at the forefront of our minds and actions. Our ESG goals are embedded in how we operate as a business, and we will continue to make progress across our key sustainability initiatives including our world without waste goals. For example, across markets representing 30% of our global volume, we now have introduced 100% recycled plastic packaging options in at least one brand, and this has grown even during the pandemic. And last month, The Netherlands and Norway became the second and third markets after Sweden to announce they will manufacture the entire local portfolio in 100% recycled PET., ESG\\ninitiatives, Sustainability goals, Recycled plastic packaging options, Global volume, Market\\nexpansion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the U.S., we continue to join other stakeholders in supporting policies to drive improved packaging collection and demand for recycled material, such as California\\'s new mandatory recycled content legislation. In recognition of the importance of this topic to our company, and I know to many of you as well, I hope you will join us for our virtual ESG investor day on November 13. To sum up, we are continuing to navigate through the uncertainties of the global pandemic. We are heading to a phase where the world is adapting to a new way of living with COVID., Navigating through uncertainties, ESG investor day, Recycled content legislation, Global pandemic,\\nAdapting to new way of living with COVID, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The progress we\\'ve made on accelerating our strategic transformation will give us the focus and flexibility to manage our business and execute with excellence today and to set ourselves up for better results in the long run. With that, I\\'ll pass it over to you, John., Accelerating strategic transformation, Focus and flexibility, Execution excellence, Long-term\\nresults, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you James, and good morning everyone. Today, I\\'d like to comment on our third quarter performance and give perspective on the financial implications of our structural changes and new operating model. I\\'ll also provide some additional context on our outlook. In the third quarter, I am pleased to report that our focus and flexibility enabled us to drive sequential improvement from the second quarter., Third\\nquarter performance, Financial implications of structural changes, New operating model, Focus and\\nflexibility, Outlook, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Our organic revenue performance was down 6% driven by price, mix down 3% and concentrate sales down 4%. This quarter\\'s performance compares to a 26% organic revenue decline in the second quarter. While most of that improvement came in the form of better volume trends, we also saw improved price, mix, particularly when you look at this on a two-year average. Comparable gross margin contracted by about 140 basis points., Organic\\nrevenue performance, Price and mix, Concentrate sales, Gross margin, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, This was primarily driven by continued, albeit less, pressure from our channel mix between away-from-home and at-home, in addition to currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 230 basis points due to ongoing cost management offsetting the pressure from the top line. While our marketing spend remained below last year\\'s levels, we did increase it sequentially and in a targeted way as we saw recovery in the business. We continue to monitor the effectiveness of spend with the goal of investing ahead of recovery., Channel\\nmix, Currency headwinds, Comparable operating margin, Marketing spend, Recovery in business, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Below operating income, we saw a strong sequential improvement in many of our equity stakes as our bottlers have quickly moved to adapt to the changes. Therefore, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.55 declined 2% year over year. This was better than our internal expectations given stronger-than-anticipated volume trends in September and the improved equity income. While the pandemic has weighed on our cash from operations year to date, we saw significant sequential improvement in the third quarter and remain intensely focused on the free cash flow opportunities ahead., Sequential improvement, Equity stakes, Comparable EPS, Cash from operations, Free cash flow\\nopportunities, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, These include further progress in our working capital initiatives and being better stewards of our capital spend. While much has changed this year with the onset of the pandemic, our focus on converting top-line growth to maximize returns has not. The changes we are making will lead us to more efficient and productive spending. These include our organizational restructuring, streamlined portfolio, disciplined innovation and optimized marketing approach., Working\\ncapital initiatives, Capital spend, Organizational restructuring, Portfolio streamlining,\\nDisciplined innovation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, As James mentioned, we\\'re streamlining our master brands by approximately 50% which significantly reduces complexity, with an impact of less than 1% to top line and profits. We expect this impact to be more than offset over time by the benefits of greater focus on our growth brands. The combination of voluntary separation programs and involuntary reductions are estimated to result in expenses ranging from approximately $350 million to $550 million. While we are not defining a targeted level of cost savings, historically, in these scenarios, we have seen a similar level of savings as compared to the cost of the programs., Master\\nbrands streamlining, Top-line and profits impact, Voluntary separation programs, Involuntary\\nreductions, Cost savings, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, These actions will help us achieve a structure that is designed for growth which, in turn, will fuel reinvestment to drive top line and margins for the long term. Said another way, the strategic priorities we\\'ve accelerated are designed to drive results that get us back to our long-term growth algorithm as fast as possible. In our last call, we talked about adapting to the various phases of the pandemic, focusing on what we can manage and control, and not getting ahead of ourselves with regard to when things might return to normal. We see no reason to change this approach for the remainder of the year., Structure\\ndesigned for growth, Long-term growth algorithm, Pandemic adaptations, Focus on manageable aspects,\\nApproach for remainder of year, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Different countries around the world are going through different phases. Some still dealing with the first wave, others dealing with or expecting a second wave, and their respective governments taking a variety of approach. All of which means continued uncertainty regarding the pandemic and the macroeconomic picture. So within this context, we will continue to hold off on providing more detailed guidance today., Pandemic\\nphases, Country-specific approaches, Uncertainty regarding pandemic and macroeconomic picture,\\nDetailed guidance, Continued uncertainty, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Having said that, there are important factors to consider for the fourth quarter. We will be benefiting from two extra days in the quarter. To the degree that away-from-home channels are impacted by targeted restrictions, we would expect price, mix pressure to continue due to channel and package mix. This mix shift in our business will also continue to have implications for gross margins., Fourth\\nquarter benefits, Targeted restrictions impact, Price and mix pressure, Channel and package mix\\nshift, Gross margin implications, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We will continue to be prudent in our marketing expenditures, but stepping up investment in a targeted way ahead of recovery with a more efficient and effective approach. As we noted in our release, we expect a currency headwind of approximately 3% to the top line and approximately 9% to comparable operating income in the fourth quarter based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. Looking at today\\'s rates and hedge positions, at this stage, the currency impact would be minimal as we head into next year. Coming out of an unusual year like 2020 will surely have implications for 2021., Marketing\\nexpenditures, Targeted investment, Currency headwind, Top line and operating income impact, Currency\\nimpact in 2021, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, It is fair to assume that 2021 will have several considerations including the cycling of 2020 impacts, the step-up in discretionary spending as well as the strategic acceleration initiatives we\\'ve outlined. While it\\'s too early to provide specific commentary, our actions give us increased confidence to recover faster than the broader economic recovery. We will provide more insight as part of our fourth-quarter call. As we think about the long term, we will continue our journey to improve cash flow, where we had made much progress last year, as well as focus on asset optimization with a goal to becoming asset-right over time., 2021\\nconsiderations, Cycling of 2020 impacts, Discretionary spending acceleration, Long-term cash flow\\nimprovement, Asset optimization, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have confidence in the health of our system as we emerge from the peak of lockdowns across the globe. System health is crucial to our success. We also remain committed to our dividend policy and balance sheet goals. We recognize the dividend is important to our investor base and continue to believe our long-term model can deliver the cash necessary to reinvest to grow the business while also supporting the dividend., Balance\\nsheet strength, System health importance, Dividend policy commitment, Long-term cash reinvestment,\\nDividend support, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We will continue to work to return to a dividend payout ratio as a percentage of free cash flow that approaches 75% over time. The acceleration of our strategy and the progress James outlined today will help drive long-term top and bottom-line growth, not only for us but for the entire Coke system. The challenges that we faced during this pandemic are by no means in the rearview mirror. Nevertheless, we are seeing promising signs that the actions we\\'re taking have put us on track to equip the organization and the data system to win., Dividend\\npayout ratio, Long-term growth, Pandemic challenges, Organizational equipping, Data system\\noptimization, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 3, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We are confident that we will return to the high end of our long-term growth model, and do so having made an impact with our stakeholders and having gained consumers\\' share and improved system economics. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions., Confidence in long-term growth, Stakeholder impact, Consumer share gain, System economics\\nimprovement, Questions and answers, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We\\'ve just closed the books on what has arguably been the toughest and most complex quarter in Coca-Cola history. And given the global pandemic, of course, this comes as no surprise. From the initial lockdowns and closures of hundreds of thousands of our customer outlets to the gradual reopening and now another round of spikes in various countries, the impacts have been profound., Toughest\\nquarter, Complexity, Global pandemic impacts, Reopening and spikes, Business closure and reopening, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In this challenging environment, we\\'ve seen some remarkable actions around the world, and I\\'d like to express my thanks to the countless people on the front lines who are working to improve our communities worldwide. And I\\'d also like to recognize my colleagues across the Coca-Cola Company and our bottling system for their tireless efforts in prioritizing the safety of our people, ensuring the resiliency of our supply chain, supporting our millions of customers globally and for being a force of good in their communities. As we navigated the quarter, we used a combination of focus and flexibility to manage through what we believe will be the peak levels of global lockdown. John will discuss the results in further detail, but as you think about the quarter and consider the future, I\\'d like to highlight the strong relationship of our performance with the intersection of two key factors., Remarkable\\nactions, Safety prioritization, Supply chain resiliency, Customer support, Future performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The trajectory of our business trends in the near term is closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of lockdowns in the market. For example, markets like Western Europe, which had high levels of restrictions and a meaningful away-from-home exposures; and India, which had an intense lockdown, experienced significant impacts. However, many of our Latin American markets with less restrictive measures and a lower away-from-home presence fared better. Further, as we went through the quarter and restrictions generally eased globally, our business saw improvements, from the 25% volume decline in April to the single-digit declines we are seeing now in July., Business\\ntrends, Lockdown impacts, Away-from-home exposure, Market performance, Volume decline, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The lockdowns also affected our share performance in the quarter. Our underlying performance in NARTD was positive and benefited from strong share gains in the at-home channel. However, this was entirely offset by a full point of negative channel mix due to the away-from-home pressure where we have strong shares. And as on-premise begins to revive, we fully expect to return to share growth, and we are already seeing sequential improvements in monthly trends., Lockdown\\nimpacts, Share performance, At-home channel strength, Away-from-home pressure, Sequential\\nimprovements, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Moving forward, we are maintaining that same level of focus and flexibility that helped us navigate the quarter as we focus on winning during the reopening phases. Thankfully, a good starting point matters. As a system, we went into the crisis in a strong position, and the system has rallied. There is a sense of optimism about what is possible as we move forward., Maintaining focus and flexibility, Winning during reopening phases, Good starting point matters,\\nSystem optimism, Moving forward, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Importantly, we are leveraging the crisis as a catalyst to accelerate the business transformation that was already under way, and we remain guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference. And we are clear on how we will emerge stronger. We will win more consumers, gain share, maintain strong system economics, strengthen our impact across our stakeholders and equip our organization to win in the future. And as we think about that future, there are two important points I\\'d like to make., Business\\ntransformation, Purpose and mission, Consumer acquisition, System economics, Future outlook, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In addition to the near-term realities of the pandemic and consumer shifts, the uncertainty around the trajectory of the macroeconomic environment is significant. We generally align with forecasts that imply the global economy could take two to three years to fully recover. Notwithstanding the macros, our north star is to return to pre-COVID levels and to do this ahead of the economic recovery. Second, we see the underlying structural reasons that Beverages for Life strategy with the consumer at the heart of everything we do remains essential., Macroeconomic\\nuncertainty, Recovery timeline, Consumer-centric approach, Beverages for Life strategy, Underlying\\nstructural reasons, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The commercial beverage industry will remain vibrant in the years to come. We know consumers will continue to spend more on commercial beverages, and they will continue to demand greater choice. This drives the need for a broad, strong portfolio, and a powerful sales and distribution system to supply that demand. Our Beverages for Life vision began a transformation of the organization, supported by a refreshed culture focused on a growth mindset., Commercial\\nbeverage industry, Consumer demand, Portfolio and distribution, Beverages for Life vision,\\nOrganizational transformation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are already well on our way down this path and seeing good results. The pandemic is prompting us to move even faster. At CAGNY earlier this year, we introduced the key elements of our strategy to accelerate top-line growth and maximize returns. We recognize that some elements need to evolve, and others need to be pushed harder to reflect the new reality., Pandemic\\nimpact, Strategy evolution, Top-line growth, Return maximization, New reality, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, So we are accelerating our strategy across five priorities. First, we are prioritizing a portfolio that combines strong global brands plus regional and scaled local brands to address critical age cohorts, need states and drinking occasions. Second, we are establishing a more disciplined innovation framework and a new path forward for increased marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we are strengthening our RGM and execution capabilities to drive relevance and responsiveness., Prioritizing portfolio, Establishing innovation framework, Strengthening RGM and execution\\ncapabilities, Accelerating strategy, Addressing critical age cohorts, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And to capitalize on these initiatives, we are enhancing our system collaboration and capturing supply chain efficiencies to fuel growth. And as a result, we\\'re continuing to evolve our organization to support the accelerated strategy and invest in new capabilities to accomplish these objectives. John will discuss how we are leveraging each of these initiatives to drive improved returns and prioritize our capital allocation to the most attractive opportunities. Turning to the portfolio., Enhancing system collaboration, Capturing supply chain efficiencies, Evolving\\norganization, Prioritizing capital allocation, Portfolio management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, At the outset of the pandemic, our goal was to ruthlessly prioritize core brands and SKUs to strengthen the resilience of our supply chain. In China, we placed a big emphasis on our sparkling portfolio during the height of the lockdown. And as a result, the category grew 14% in volume this quarter, led by trademark Coke, with strong growth in zero-sugar offerings. The learnings from the last several months and the insights from our already accelerated SKU rationalization has convinced us to go even deeper on this opportunity by streamlining brands., Prioritizing\\ncore brands, Strengthening supply chain resilience, Growth of sparkling portfolio in China, SKU\\nrationalization, Streamlining brands, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are shifting to prioritizing fewer but bigger and stronger brands across various consumer needs. At the same time, we need to do a better job nurturing and growing smaller, more enduring propositions and exiting some zombie brands, not just zombie SKUs. As a reference point, of our 400 master brands, more than half are single-country brands with little to no scale. The total combined revenue of those brands is approximately 2% of our total., Prioritizing\\nbigger and stronger brands, Nurturing and growing smaller brands, Exiting zombie brands, Total\\ncombined revenue of single-country brands, Master brand management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, They\\'re growing slower than the company average, but each one still requires resources and investment. So in the case of a brand like Odwalla and its chilled direct store delivery, which has struggled over the last several years, we started to stop operations effective July the 31st. This gives us the flexibility to support our investments in brands like Minute Maid and Simply and to continue to scale rising stars like Topo Chico. Turning to innovation and marketing., Growth rate of slower-growing brands, Resource allocation, Investment in brands like\\nMinute Maid and Simply, Stopping operations of Odwalla, Flexibility in support of rising stars, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Innovation remains critical to our Beverages for Life strategy and launch activity has been on the rise over several years. While this expansion of innovation has been a considerable growth driver for the Coke system, many launches failed to escape the tail and struggled to grow. We can do better. We believe the best way forward is to be more choiceful and target bigger, more scalable bets and be disciplined in our experimentation., Innovation,\\nLaunch activity, Growth driver, Choicefulness, Discipline in experimentation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Over time, our leader, challenger and explorer brands can grow to positions that deliver scale and profitability. We are raising the bar and adding more discipline to our innovation pipeline against defined criteria, either recruiting new consumers, increasing the frequency of existing consumers and/or being margin-accretive. We are leading with global bets like the continued opportunity with reduced sugar offerings in brand Coke. We\\'ll also continue our high-potential regional and local bets, like AHA flavored sparkling water in the U.S., Leader,\\nchallenger, and explorer brands, Innovation pipeline, Scale and profitability, Reduced sugar\\nofferings in brand Coke, High-potential regional and local bets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AHA captured double-digit retail value share in its first 18 weeks and has even more potential given its wide appeal. With consumers prioritizing health, safety, and hygiene even more, there is a runway for innovation in functional benefits and contactless solutions. We\\'ll prioritize innovation centers on products, packaging and equipment. Last week, for example, we announced the introduction of touchless Freestyle machines in the U.S., which allows consumers to choose and pour drinks from their phones in just a few seconds without the need to create an account or download an app., AHA,\\nFunctional benefits, Contactless solutions, Innovation centers, Touchless Freestyle machines, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This is an example of leveraging increased flexibility to create a solution, test it, and roll it out in a few months. In addressing our marketing effectiveness and efficiency, we are targeting several areas to improve how we do things, in effect taking a fresh approach to ensure all our investments have a future role. We are increasing our focus on the cut-through quality of our messages and their alignment with in-market execution plans through purpose-driven, occasion-based initiatives. The next phase of our global campaign that started with the pandemic is going live now with a large program pairing Coke and meals., Leveraging\\nflexibility, Marketing effectiveness and efficiency, Cut-through quality of messages, Alignment with\\nin-market execution plans, Global campaign, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Together Tastes Better will kick off in the U.S. but will be rolled out globally. Open Together, another holistic program, invites the world to enjoy the simple and important things in life and will also be introduced this summer across multiple media channels. These campaigns are designed to be flexible and were created for Coca-Cola teams around the world to tailor and localize to their markets and platforms., Together Tastes Better, Open Together, Holistic program, Flexibility, Localization, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, They are prime examples of how driving maximum impact and reach with focused investments. Further, on the efficiency side, we are pushing our marketing ratios and reassessing our overall marketing return on investment on everything, from ad viewership across traditional media to improving effectiveness in digital. Turning to RGM and execution. Beyond these brand and innovation initiatives, we are deploying our capabilities in revenue growth management and execution to adapt to changing channel dynamics., Driving impact\\nand reach, Efficiency side, Marketing ratios, Revenue growth management, Execution, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Providing beverages people desire at a price they can afford is increasingly important given the macroeconomic pressures could be substantial and enduring. By segmenting our markets to provide solutions to fit every budget, revenue growth management also creates opportunity to deliver value through more profitable channels and premium packages. RGM is not just about price. It is about offering a range of solutions to consumers at every part of the value chain and balancing profitability to maintain and grow our consumer base., Providing affordable beverages, Segmenting markets, Revenue growth management, Premium\\npackages, Balancing profitability, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the case of Latin America, we are moving quickly to increase our refillable offerings to address affordability. At the same time, in Japan, we\\'re working to decouple the 500 ml coke offering to a larger and smaller pack options to help drive both transactions and enhance our revenue per case. Beyond RGM, we are working with our bottling partners to improve execution by addressing changing channel dynamics and supporting our customers, be it through periods of elevated demand, like we\\'ve seen in grocery and modern trade, or the lockdown-related challenges we\\'re seeing in on-premise channels. In Europe, we\\'re launching a new campaign, Open Like Never Before, as a means to support on-premise reopenings, as well as smaller independent outlets and at-home occasions., Affordability,\\nRefillable offerings, Pack options, Execution, On-premise channels, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the U.S., we\\'ve helped over 300,000 of our foodservice outlets manage through the lockdown, and now we are there to help them get back and be stronger than ever through initiatives like our rapid response resource. We are continuing to invest heavily in executing digital strategies to drive sales, efficiencies and data analytics across our business. We recently appointed a global VP of offline to online digital transformation to work closely with leaders across the system to unify and scale our e-commerce and digital strategy. We\\'re aggressively going after the omnichannel opportunity with the consumer at the center., Digital Strategies, E-commerce, Omnichannel, Lockdown, Sales, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Partnering with a large e-commerce platform in China, we increased our system revenue through that customer by 65% during the recent 618 Festival, the largest midyear shopping festival in China. Our partnerships with third-party aggregators are driving incidence as consumers quickly migrate to mobile delivery for groceries and prepared meals. For instance, working with large restaurant delivery intermediaries in North America, we added value bundles to over 4,500 restaurant menus in the quarter. We\\'re also accelerating our B2B platforms to streamline the value chain with modern trade., Digital Strategies,\\nE-commerce, Partnerships, Mobile Delivery, B2B Platforms, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the U.S., we\\'ve added more than 8,000 outlets to the myCoke digitized ordering platform just this quarter, allowing a contactless relationship with our customers. Finally, we\\'re experimenting with direct-to-consumer by expanding platforms like Coca-Cola en tu Hogar throughout Latin America. This web-based solution delivers to homes as quickly as the next day and currently enjoys 1 million household users at a healthy double-digit growth rate. To execute these initiatives with speed and effectiveness, we\\'ve worked closely with our bottling partners through the crisis., Digital Ordering,\\nContactless Experience, Direct-to-Consumer, Expansion, Bottling Partnerships, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The connectivity across the system has been extraordinary. In the last few months, we\\'ve held global and regional system meetings with leadership, allowing us to accomplish even more than we thought possible. We will continue this increased engagement and sharing of best practices with our bottlers from top to bottom post pandemic as we recognize the opportunity to collaborate even more closely across the supply chain and to leverage our collective global scale. Ultimately, we aspire to grow faster systemwide and deliver stronger results that will enable us to continue investing and putting our purpose into action., Collaboration, Best\\nPractices, Global Scale, System Growth, Purpose, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to the organization. Since we set out on the Beverages for Life journey, we have evolved our organization every step of the way, and we continue to do so to ensure structure follows strategy. To focus on a growth portfolio of profitable brands with quality leadership positions that is supported by an efficient and effective marketing model, we need to be flexible. Our system is continuing to move further away from a complicated, three-dimensional organizational structure to more of a network model, improving our agility and maximizing scale., Organization,\\nStructure, Growth Portfolio, Marketing Model, Agility, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As the pandemic acts as a catalyst to accelerate our strategy, our organization is moving into the future faster, too, and we must set up properly to empower our system to win. This will require us to reallocate people resources and could mean some reductions due to our evolving approach. There is no doubt that we faced significant pressures in the second quarter, but we exited the quarter with promising signs the most challenging period is indeed behind us in much of the world. There\\'s still a lot of work to do, there\\'s no doubt the world will be different following the crisis., Organization,\\nStrategy, People Resources, Pressures, Future, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In many ways, the future is coming at us faster than ever. We are embracing the changes and pivoting our business to take advantage of new opportunities. We are poised as a system to accelerate our transformation to return to driving growth in years to come. Before I hand the call over to John, I\\'d like to take a moment to comment on the social justice movements that had significant impacts around the world., Future,\\nTransformation, Growth, Social Justice, Impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Let me be clear. Our stance is there is no place for racism or institutionalized inequality in the world. We are taking an active approach and focusing our efforts on listening, leading, investing and advocating. We\\'re engaging stakeholders, employees and other business leaders, and we\\'ve paused social media for the time being while we review our policies to ensure a higher level of accountability and transparency., Racism, Inequality,\\nStance, Active Approach, Policies, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We recently committed to spend an incremental $500 million with Black-owned suppliers and are actively contributing to communities on this important issue. With that, John will discuss our results and provide more details on how we plan to drive returns as our increased focus provides the flexibility we need., Black-owned\\nSuppliers, Community Contributions, Focus, Returns, Increased Flexibility, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I\\'d like to spend my time this morning focused on three things: one, some commentary on the quarter and the rest-of-year outlook; two, thoughts on the broader and longer-term implications to value creation for our company and our system; and finally, on our capital allocation priorities. As expected, our second quarter was one with significant hurdles to overcome as lockdown and social distancing requirements placed profound pressures on our customers and consumers. In the second quarter, volumes were down 16%, driven by declines in higher revenue per case away-from-home channels., Quarterly Outlook,\\nLong-term Implications, Capital Allocation Priorities, Customer Pressures, Volume Declines, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Organic revenues declined 26%, driven by a 22% decline in concentrate shipments and a 4% decline in price/mix. The gap between concentrate shipments and unit cases this quarter is attributable to cycling the timing of shipments from last year, primarily in EMEA and Latin America, along with rationalization of stock levels after some safety stock-building in the first quarter. The majority of the price/mix pressure during the quarter was driven by segment mix from meaningful declines in our cost of business in Global Ventures, as well as Bottling Investments. Underlying gross margin was down approximately 300 basis points, primarily driven by volume declines in capital-intensive finished goods businesses like Costa, food service in North America, and our Bottling Investments in addition to negative package and channel mix pressure., Organic Revenues,\\nConcentrate Shipments, Price/Mix, Gross Margin, Volume Declines, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Despite the significant pressure on top line and gross margin, in addition to the currency headwinds, comparable operating margins were only slightly lower than last year given the effective management of our SG&A expenses. While we had a considerable amount of leverage during the quarter from cost management, part of it is attributable to timing due to modifying our full-year marketing spend forecast, which included an adjustment from the first quarter. As we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to hold off on providing full-year guidance, given the amount of uncertainty that remains. That said, there are some factors worth highlighting as you think about the second half., Top Line, Gross\\nMargin, SG&A Expenses, Marketing Spend, Uncertainty, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, While we believe the second quarter will be the most severely impacted, we do expect the top-line trajectory to continue to correlate closely to the level of mobility of consumers and the health of the away-from-home channels, as James discussed earlier. The pandemic is not behind us. There is still good reason to be cautious as global COVID infections continue to increase, with case growth generally shifting from developed to emerging markets. While we are seeing sequential improvement, recovery will likely not to be linear., Top-line Trajectory,\\nMobility of Consumers, Health of Away-from-Home Channels, Pandemic, Recovery, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Some markets that were recovering are having a second spike in cases like we\\'re seeing in Iran, Australia, Romania and here in the United States. Depending on the trajectory of recovery in away-from-home, channel and package mix will continue to put pressure on our gross margin. At the same time, while we do expect continued cost savings in the back half, the amount of leverage should moderate as we look to accelerate our marketing investments, given improving ROI characteristics in a number of markets. I\\'d also add that if the top line improves faster than expectations, we are prepared to reinvest more aggressively to further strengthen our position heading into 2021., Markets with Second\\nSpike in Cases, Away-from-Home Channel Pressure, Cost Savings, Marketing Investments, Reinvestment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, And finally, moving to below the line, in an effort to extend the duration of our outstanding debt, in the first half, we issued $11.5 billion of long-term maturities, resulting in higher interest expense. While we firmly believe this is the right thing to do longer term, you will continue to see a year-over-year increase in interest expense in the back half of the year. James laid out the approach we are taking on the portfolio, innovation, marketing, execution and system efficiencies to return our company to top-line growth at the high end of our growth algorithm. We believe strongly in our future being propelled by top-line growth, but we also appreciate the top line must ultimately create value that meets or exceeds our shareholder expectations., Long-term Maturities,\\nInterest Expense, Top-line Growth, Shareholder Expectations, Portfolio, Innovation, Marketing,\\nExecution, System Efficiencies, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, To this end, we are focused on the following critical objectives. First, we are defining even more sharply the optimal shape of our P&L and balance sheet. We have developed a clear mission, strategic drivers and financial expectations for each of our business segments and have set objectives to improve margins and free cash flow across the board. We leverage these improved returns and invest what is needed to fund continued growth while ensuring our balance sheet remains fit-for-purpose for our future needs., Optimal P&L Shape,\\nBalance Sheet, Financial Expectations, Margins, Free Cash Flow, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Second, opportunities abound to cultivate more efficient growth. As James discussed earlier, we are moving with speed to optimize marketing spend, consolidated behind our growth portfolio and business segment priorities. Using our productivity mindset, we are continuing to uncover cost-saving opportunities across the supply chain and operating expenses. But the hallmark of our business is winning locally with our consumers and customers., Growth Opportunities,\\nMarketing Spend Optimization, Cost-Saving Opportunities, Supply Chain Efficiency, Winning Locally, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, We continue to see opportunities to scale several services across the system to unlock synergies. In addition, as we evolve the organization to follow this strategy, this too will drive better resource allocation. As James mentioned, our global system will continue to collaborate as our strategy accelerates and evolves. And together, we are working to be nimbler to sustain the growth that follows., Scaling Services,\\nResource Allocation, Global System Collaboration, Growth Sustainability, Evolution of Organization, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, As we pursue these objectives, our capital allocation priorities remain the same: reinvest where appropriate in the business to drive momentum and continue to grow the dividend, returning cash to our shareholders. M&A and share repurchase are unlikely to play a prominent role in the near term. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain confident in our liquidity position as we continue to navigate through the crisis. As we work through the system to manage through the current challenges caused by COVID-19, our bottlers are not immune to the effects of the business disruption., Capital Allocation\\nPriorities, Dividend Growth, M&A, Share Repurchase, Balance Sheet Strength, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, That said, approximately 80% of our business volumetrically is in the hands of our top 15 bottlers, are run through our Bottling Investment group. The remaining 20% are small to midsized. Our large public bottlers are well-managed companies with healthy balance sheets, nearly all of our small to midsized bottlers are in a stable position and taking proactive steps on efficient working capital management, expenses, and capital to manage the situation. As we close the books on the second quarter, there is no doubt that this has been a challenging time for the Coca-Cola system., Top Bottlers, Small\\nto Midsized Bottlers, Working Capital Management, Expenses, Capital Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 2, John Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, Throughout, our system has remained focused on the journey ahead, pivoting and adapting to ensure that we accelerate our transformation, allowing our system to emerge stronger. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions., Transformation,\\nSystem Strength, Adaptation, Pivoting, Emergence, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I\\'ll start by noting that we\\'re operating in truly extraordinary times, times of great challenges but also times in which we can see many opportunities ahead., Opportunities Ahead,\\nChallenges, Operating in Extraordinary Times, Growth, Transformation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I\\'d like to share our deepest sympathies with all those who have been affected by this global pandemic. We also sincerely thank those who\\'ve been working to keep all of us safe through the crisis, particularly those on the frontlines in the healthcare community. I also want to recognize our system associates who are ensuring we can continue to supply beverages all around the world., Sympathies,\\nGratitude, Frontlines, Supply Chain, Global Pandemic, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re still in the most intense first phase of the crisis in many places, if not most of the world. Through it all, we remain grounded in our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. We start with employee health and safety, which is paramount, followed by business continuity and our support of communities around the world., Employee Health and\\nSafety, Business Continuity, Supporting Communities, Purpose, Refreshing the World, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The vast majority of our office-based employees are working remotely. For those associates in our manufacturing and distribution facilities, we\\'re using enhanced hygiene and sanitation practices. Through these practices, we\\'re ensuring our system associates are well and our products are safe and that they\\'re delivered safely to our customers and consumers. We\\'re closely linked with our bottlers on business continuity, which includes contingency planning for our global supply chain. And thanks to the efforts across the whole system, we don\\'t foresee any material disruptions at this time., Vast Majority,\\nEnhanced Hygiene, Sanitation Practices, Business Continuity, Material Disruptions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, It\\'s important to note that our business has a long heritage of supporting communities in times of need. The Coca-Cola system has made significant commitments to support relief efforts in markets impacted across the globe. Our system is committed to contributing more than a $100 million and is focused on community relief programs, medical supplies, and equipment during the outbreak phase, as well as on developing other actions for the recovery phase in markets hit hardest by the pandemic. The commitments to date include a $40 million charitable grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation., Community Relief\\nPrograms, Medical Supplies and Equipment, Charitable Grant, Recovery Phase, Pandemic Impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are working collaboratively with governments at all levels; federal, state, and local, to help still the nation and the world toward recovery we are all confident that we can, with the communities we proudly call home, rebound if we all work together for a better future., Collaboration,\\nGovernments, Recovery, Confidence, Better Future, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now as we look to the future, we recognize these are truly unprecedented times, and for that reason, we will take a different approach to our guidance and our discussion today. Recognizing that the operating backdrop has changed rapidly in the last several weeks, we will spend limited time discussing our first quarter results. In addition, given the great uncertainty of the current environment, we feel it\\'s prudent to hold off providing fiscal year 2020 guidance. We expect to come back at our second quarter call in July with greater clarity., Future, Unprecedented\\nTimes, First Quarter Results, Fiscal Year 2020 Guidance, Second Quarter Call, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Today, I\\'d like to share; one, what we\\'ve been learning and observing as the situation evolves; second, the actions we\\'re taking now, both to adapt to the current environment and to best position ourselves for the future; third and finally, what gives me confidence that we will emerge even stronger; and lastly, I\\'ll turn it over to John to discuss our financial strategy., Learning and\\nObservations, Actions Taken, Confidence, Financial Strategy, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The first quarter began with good momentum coming off strong results in 2019. We were successfully executing our long-term strategy. Through February, we had solid broad-based strength across the globe with the exception of China where the progression of virus was already well ahead of the rest of the world. Looking at it, excluding China, our business is growing volumes 3%, and we will continue to gain value share. But as shelter at home and social distancing practices increased rapidly and globally, there has been temporary but profound pressure on our customers and our business., First Quarter\\nMomentum, Long-Term Strategy, Global Growth, Shelter at Home, Social Distancing Practices, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The biggest impact has been a sharp decline in the important away-from-home portion of our business, which includes our eating and drinking channels as well as our on-the-go orientated channels like convenience retail. While our exposure varies across markets, away-from-home broadly represents about half of our business given our strong share positions. In some markets, like the US, drive-thru operations and carryout have helped offset some of the pressure, but most restaurants are operating on limited hours and are seeing overall trips decline sharply., Away-From-Home\\nBusiness, Sharp Decline, Eating and Drinking Channels, On-The-Go Oriented Channels, Limited Hours\\nOperations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the at-home channels, we\\'ve seen some early pantry loading, particularly in certain developed markets at the beginning of many of the lockdown phases. Then, as we get past the initial phase of the lockdown, however, we are seeing levels normalize. In other markets, like India, for example, the severity of the distancing measures has negatively impacted at-home as well, simply due to the significant reduction in shopping trips. At this stage, it\\'s a little too early to determine exactly what level at-home trends will stabilize at., At-Home Channels,\\nPantry Loading, Lockdown Phases, Developed Markets, India, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve also seen a significant increase in e-commerce channels where we have been accelerating our presence versus the pre-crisis. However, given the net effect of these shifts, we expect a temporary but significant impact on our business in the second quarter primarily coming from the slowdown in our away-from-home business. For context, if we look at our April month-to-date trends, we are seeing volumes down globally, approximately, 25% driven by the sharp declines in our away-from-home businesses. Fortunately, based on the latest projections, we do expect the second quarter to be the most severely impacted., Away-From-Home\\nBusiness, E-Commerce Channels, Temporary Impact, Second Quarter Impact, April Month-To-Date Trends, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, With that said, there is still a good deal of uncertainty around the trajectory of the pandemic, as well as the resulting macroeconomic impact. While we\\'re seeing different impacts across geographies and at different times, generally we expect three phases. The outbreak with its corresponding social distancing measures, a period of graduated reopenings, and finally, a return to a new normal. Consumer mindset and shopping behavior will be different in each phase, and they\\'ll vary across markets, but we foresee some similar patents that I\\'ll discuss in greater detail., Uncertainty,\\nTrajectory of Pandemic, Macroeconomic Impact, Different Impacts, Gradually Reopenings, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Of course, we can look to China for some early learnings about the various phases. I\\'m happy to say that our plants there are all operating and employees have returned to company offices in Shanghai. We\\'re seeing encouraging signs of increased consumption as outlets reopen resulting in sequential improvements in China. However, the consumption is still lower than prior year, and we expect a full recovery to take time, especially as there are still limits on crowd sizes., China, Early\\nLearnings, Sequential Improvements, Consumption, Full Recovery, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As we anticipate a recovery in China, we\\'re planning key actions with bottlers to regain momentum, including a pre-summer sales promotion and increased cooler placements. We will follow the strategy that has proved successful before the pandemic, adjusted with greater focus on channels and packages that will have traction as the new normal unfolds., Planning Key Actions,\\nPre-Summer Sales Promotion, Increased Cooler Placements, New Normal Unfolds, Proven Successful, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, While we are encouraged by the improving trends in China, we recognize that other countries may not follow the same trajectory and changes in social distancing practices may be gradual. And the situation in China could certainly continue to evolve. It is simply too soon to estimate exactly what might lay ahead., Improving Trends,\\nGradual Changes, Social Distancing Practices, Estimating Ahead, China, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, That\\'s why we\\'re taking swift action now to adapt in the near term, while best positioning ourselves for success later. Our global workforce is a critical asset and protecting people [Indecipherable] is a high priority. Teams around the world are being asked to work differently, and they\\'re rising to the occasion. We have implemented real-time network collaboration routines to accelerate knowledge sharing. We\\'re adapting local market strategies across our system, including supply chain, stakeholder engagement, and workforce management. We\\'ve adopted dynamic resource allocation practices in many regions matching people to projects and scaling the best ideas across geographies. In many ways, the strategy we laid out at CAGNY remains the same centered around brand building, innovation, revenue growth management, and execution. Having the ability to dial-up and recalibrate aspects of that strategy is critical in this environment., Adapting, Protecting\\nPeople, Real-Time Collaboration, Local Market Strategies, Dynamic Resource Allocation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, A culture of agility is key. We are working seamlessly with our bottlers and retail customers to make real-time demand given the rapid shifts in customer patterns. Bottler alignment has never been more important and the work we\\'ve done to strengthen the system in recent years is bearing fruit in steps of execution., Agility, Real-Time\\nDemand, Bottler Alignment, Customer Patterns, System Execution, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, For our retail customers, grocery stores for example, we\\'re focused on maximizing system efficiency by ruthlessly prioritizing to deliver on core SKUs and key brands and help customers simplify their supply chains. We\\'re also taking this opportunity to reshape our innovation pipeline to eliminate a longer tail of smaller projects and allocate resources to fewer, larger, more scalable, and more relevant solutions for this environment., Retail Customers,\\nSystem Efficiency, Core SKUs, Innovation Pipeline, Resource Allocation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, With shoppers spending less time browsing, it\\'s crucial that we work to minimize out-of-stocks and maximize share of visible inventory. In markets around the world, we\\'ve redeployed on-the-ground sales reps, especially those orientated toward the on-premise trade and refocused them on merchandising, resulting in increased share of displays and stock on the floor. As consumers adjust to stay-at-home lifestyle, they\\'re making fewer shopping trips and filling bigger baskets often based on availability and orientate to known trusted brands. Therefore, we are working with our customers to maximize promotional effectiveness and reconsidering multi-pack promotions and frequency, to ensure the mix of our product and packaging offerings are meeting their needs., Minimizing Out-of-\\nStocks, Maximizing Visible Inventory, On-Premise Trade, Promotional Effectiveness, Multi-Pack\\nPromotions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our consumer-centric total beverage strategy has enabled us to deliver products that shoppers want when stocking up on essentials, whether it\\'s to refresh, hydrate, or provide functional benefits. We also recognize the importance of customers both big and small and are working to support independent retailers. We\\'re implementing measures to support small retailers in many countries. For example, in Brazil mom-and-pop stores face mounting pressure and they are a key pillar not only of our business but local communities. We have played a leading role in the formation of the Small Trade Activity Recovery or STAR program. Along with consumer product peers, the STAR coalition will connect companies, governments, and small retail associations to help small and medium retailers., Consumer-Centric\\nStrategy, Essential Products, Small Retailers, Independent Retailers, STAR Program, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve also experienced an upsurge in e-commerce across the globe, with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. Consumers are getting necessities delivered to their door, in many cases with contact-less delivery. Revenue growth management plays a key role in our current strategy as we shift toward package sizes that are fit-for-purpose online sales and as we reallocate consumer and trade promotions to digital. For grocery e-delivery companies, we\\'ve increased our visibility with a focus on multi-packs so consumers can access our beverage within a click\\'s reach of desire., E-commerce Growth,\\nContactless Delivery, Revenue Growth Management, Visibility Increase, Multi-Packs, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are also acting fast to address the needs of restaurant partners as they adapt to the current environment. In North America, we\\'ve offered our foodservice restaurant partners an alternative to fountain drinks by ensuring bottle or can availability for delivery. In the US, we\\'ve partnered with the national leading food aggregator to increase our product profile and accelerate customer menu optimization by including beverage options and value bundles. Also we\\'ve recently played an active role in the Great American Takeout movement with the National Restaurant Association., Restaurant Partners, Fast Acting, Foodservice, Menu Optimization, Great American\\nTakeout, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also being mindful about the right level of brand marketing and new product launches given the consumer mindset across the markets. We\\'ve developed and determined that in this initial phase, there is limited effectiveness to broad-based brand marketing. With this in mind, we\\'ve reduced our direct consumer communication. We\\'ll pull sizable marketing campaign through the early stages of the crisis and reengage when the timing is right. These plans will vary from market-to-market with our earliest reengagement focusing on the recovery in China. At the same time, we are leveraging our associates to address longer term opportunities recognizing that near-term realities will subside., Brand Marketing, New\\nProduct Launches, Consumer Mindset, Market-to-Market Variation, Associate Leverage, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Looking ahead, we may not know the exact shape of the recovery, but we are taking actions today to be prepared for the future. For the recovery phase, RGM is key as we prepare to strike a right balance of affordability on recruitment packs in addition to premium offerings. This is one area where we are much better positioned versus our system 10 years ago when our portfolio and SKU optionality was not nearly as sophisticated as it\\'s today., Looking Ahead, Recovery Phase, Revenue Growth Management, Premium Offerings, Portfolio\\nSophistication, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll also embrace some seismic consumer behavior shifts that are taking place, especially in e-commerce. We believe the accelerating expansion of the channel is sustainable, and we want to continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. We are investing in digital capabilities to strengthen consumer connections and further piloting several different digital-enabled initiatives using fulfillment methods, whether B2B to home or B2B platforms in many countries to capture online demand for at-home consumption in the future. We\\'re seeing good results in these early days and are looking to scale similar partnerships and more customers., E-commerce Growth,\\nConsumer Behavior Shifts, Digital Capabilities, Fulfillment Methods, Partnerships, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In times when a crisis has hit it can be easy to lose sight of the long-term, but we will continue to build a more sustainable business for the future. Late last year we refreshed our purpose statement, we refresh the world to make a difference, and our company\\'s purpose is now more important than ever. Tomorrow the Company will publish its 2019 business and sustainability report reflecting a continued journey toward driving a more sustainable business., Building a\\nSustainable Business, Purpose Statement, Refresh the World, Company\\'s Purpose, Sustainability\\nReport, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, While there are still many unknowns ahead, we do know that over a 134 years of business we\\'ve seen many types of crisis, be they military, economic, or pandemic, and the Coca-Cola Company has always emerged stronger in the end. We are in a better position today than we were heading into previous periods of challenge. We\\'ve made meaningful progress in accelerating our capabilities, reshaping our bottling system, pivoting our portfolio, and transforming our culture. Undoubtedly, there will be ups and downs in the coming months, but with our bottling partners, we are clear on what needs to be done, both now and into the future, to manage our business, focus our strategies, accelerate our actions, and redirect our investments., Crisis Management,\\nBusiness Resilience, Cultural Transformation, Portfolio Pivoting, Bottling System Acceleration, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James. And thanks to all of you for joining us. I\\'d like to complement James\\'s remarks with a particular focus on the following areas. Our people, 2020 profitability and cash flow, capital allocation priorities, our bottling system, and our post-COVID readiness., People,\\nProfitability, Cash Flow, Capital Allocation, Bottling System, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, It may be a little unusual to start the finance view on people, but in these times, it is absolutely the right place to start. The manner in which we have seen sacrifice, commitment, resilience, and adaptability in the past weeks has stood out, and we have been able to accomplish things which in normal times would have seemed impossible., People, Sacrifice,\\nCommitment, Resilience, Adaptability, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As with many companies, job security is a concern for our people, and for us it has been a key priority as we navigate through this period. Where necessary, we have furloughed some employees and we have done so on full pay through June. The length, severity, and overall impact of the crisis will ultimately determine how we will come out of it, and we will be very thoughtful on our approach., Job Security,\\nFurloughs, Pay, Approach, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, What we do see, as James mentioned, is a lot of redeployment, enabling the company to pivot quickly for the work that matters most in these times. The agility we are seeing across the world in this regard has been impressive and is opening the door to new ways of working that are allowing us to be a lot more responsive., Agility,\\nResponsiveness, Redeployment, New Ways of Working, Pivoting, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For me, some of the work that matters most is smart use of the many levers we have at our disposal to maximize profit and cash flow. On the revenue side, we have made substantial changes to our brand pack portfolio focus and are leveraging the playbooks on affordability and value that have served us so well in past crisis around the world., Profit, Cash Flow,\\nBrand Portfolio, Affordability, Value, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, On the expenditure side, I would divide it into four key focus areas and with a particular emphasis on quarter two. One, as James mentioned, we have been pulling back on our marketing spend for now. Being close to our consumers in a relevant way is a key guiding principle and staying disciplines to demand an appropriate ROI is a close second., Marketing Spend,\\nDiscipline, ROI, Quarter Two, Consumers, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Two, we are taking a similar approach with our trade dollars. While much of that spend is managed by our bottlers in both our bottling investments and North America businesses, this is an important area to effectively manage and be willing to reengineer., Trade Dollars,\\nManaging Spend, Reengineering, Bottling Investments, North America Businesses, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Three, we are attacking all discretionary operating expenses and challenging what is essential and making sure every dollar is being spent on services, travel, meetings, etc. is appropriate. And four, we have paused all capital spend other than what is absolutely essential or has already been committed. By moving quickly and decisively, we will avoid waste, improve ROI and spend, and give us maximum flexibility for the second half of the year as we gain clarity on the outlook. Finally, as a quick reminder for your models, the reductions to marketing and trade spend will get phased over the balance of the year., Attacking\\nDiscretionary Expenses, Essential Spending, Capital Spend, Pausing Spend, Phasing Reductions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our capital allocation priorities should be framed against our liquidity position on our balance sheet. With the actions taken since March, our overall liquidity is strong and so too is our balance sheet. We will, of course, continue to focus on protecting the progress we\\'ve made on working capital and free cash flow in 2019. And in this context, our capital allocation priorities remain very much focused on investing wisely to support our business operations and continuing to prioritize our dividend., Liquidity, Balance\\nSheet, Working Capital, Free Cash Flow, Dividend, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Specifically with regards to the dividends, we currently have no intentions to change our approach. Regarding M&A, we do not foresee any significant activity going forward this year, nor do we intend to repurchase shares. We are also mindful of staying close to the debt range we have previously highlighted. We will, of course, review our overall approach to capital allocation as we know more about the length and severity of the crisis., Dividends, M&A, Debt\\nRange, Capital Allocation, Crisis, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, James spoke earlier about how our global bottling system is adapting to the coronavirus pandemic. I cannot overstate the admiration we all have for everything our bottling partners are doing to stay close to their people, their customers, and their communities. Many of them are battle-hardened when it comes to managing crisis, and I know they are proactively taking steps to preserve cash, strengthen their balance sheets, and manage their P&Ls., Bottling Partners,\\nCrisis Management, Cash Preservation, Balance Sheets, P&L Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Currently, we do not have any major concerns surrounding our bottling partners from a liquidity perspective, and we are working closely with them to anticipate and deal effectively with a scenario where the coronavirus situation is longer and more severe than currently anticipated., Liquidity Concerns,\\nCoronavirus Situation, Bottling Partners, Crisis Management, Anticipation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As we noted in our release, we are unable to provide an update to our full-year 2020 financial outlook. We expect to have a better picture of how the recovery will unfold when we report our second quarter results in July. Meantime, I would like to highlight the following. In looking at currency impacts for comparable net revenues based on current spot rates and including the impact of hedge positions, we expect a mid-single digit full-year headwind., Currency Impacts,\\nFull-Year Financial Outlook, Second Quarter Results, Hedge Positions, Recovery Unfolding, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For comparable operating income also based on current spot rates, expect a high-single digit headwind with most of the headwind coming from our developing and emerging markets. We still expect the company\\'s underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for the year., Comparable Operating\\nIncome, Developing and Emerging Markets, Tax Rate, Company\\'s Underlying Effective Tax Rate, High-\\nSingle Digit Headwind, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Looking ahead, it\\'s important that we adapt quickly to the current environment, while also best positioning ourselves to win in the post-COVID world. Emerging stronger from this crisis demands a willingness to challenge the status quo. To that end, we are using this time to do just that. Last couple of months already taught us how to do many things very differently., Adapting to Current\\nEnvironment, Post-COVID World, Challenging Status Quo, Emerging Stronger, Doing Things Differently, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2020, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In closing, let me say, I have never been more proud to be a part of the Coca-Cola system or indeed more optimistic. It\\'s a testament to the cultural transformation taking hold across the organization. Our people and the strategic alignment of our system give me the confidence in our ability to not only manage through the current prices but to emerge from it stronger., Cultural\\nTransformation, Strategic Alignment, Confidence, Emerging Stronger, Prices Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As you\\'ll have seen from our results today, we are pleased to report another quarter of strong performance, capping off a successful year in 2019. We delivered on our financial commitments for the year even in the face of stronger-than-expected currency headwinds. We see the right strategies taking hold, supported by the right partners, underpinned by a growing and vibrant industry, but we\\'re just getting started. This is what gives us confidence in our 2020 outlook, and we are optimistic about the long-term opportunities in front of us. As regards to 2019, our business performed well. We gained value share globally in addition to gaining share in each of our geographic segments, achieving our largest share gain in almost a decade, with 34 of our top 40 markets gaining share. Organic revenue grew 6%, two points ahead of our initial forecast and at the top end of our long-term growth model. Top line growth was driven by strength across all the operating segments. Comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 13% versus our initial goal of 10% to 11% through accelerated top line growth and delivering on our productivity targets. Comparable EPS grew 1%, at the top end of our guidance despite a higher-than-expected 8-point currency headwind. Finally, we delivered $10.5 billion in cash from operations, up 37% from prior year and well ahead of our initial guidance. Our 2019 performance was the result of our broad-based success across the majority of our markets. Globally, we achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth within our developing and emerging markets, along with mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in our developed markets. So let me walk you around the world a little and touch on some of the strategic actions that we have been taking., Strong Performance,\\nFinancial Commitments, Right Strategies, Growing Industry, Long-Term Opportunities, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In North America, we delivered a solid performance in 2019, and we are well positioned with a strong marketing and innovation pipeline heading into 2020. Organic revenue grew 3% for the year and while we continued to gain overall value share, too. Trademark Coca-Cola drove our performance with 4% retail value growth. Volumes in trademark Coke were positive for the second consecutive year, even as we continue to execute on our smaller pack initiatives. Across our refranchised North American bottling system, there is improved execution and continued conviction about the long-term growth opportunities for our business. Over the past few years, the system has invested nearly $0.75 billion to support our innovation and revenue growth management agenda. This includes expanding availability of our popular mini cans, which again grew in the double digits for the year. Latin America. Here we achieve 13% organic revenue growth, while navigating a tough macro environment by focusing on the fundamentals included expanding cooler placements, the acceleration of single serve packs and increasing availability of returnable packaging in under index markets. For example, in Brazil, we delivered the best performance we\\'ve seen in seven years, growing more than twice the rate of consumer spending. Our results were driven by high single-digit growth of single-serve packages, due in part to a more than 20% increase in cooler placements by our bottling partners. This aligned focus and investment is a testament to the long-term opportunities our system sees in this large and important market., North America, Latin\\nAmerica, Market Performance, Innovation Pipeline, Long-Term Opportunities, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The resilience of our Brazilian business helped deliver solid results in Latin America despite markets such as Argentina, where the economic situation continued to deteriorate during the year. In EMEA, organic revenue growth of 5% was balanced between solid industry growth and strong share gains. Growth was driven by strong results across developed, developing and emerging markets while innovations with Coca-Cola led to the best performance we\\'ve seen in the last eight years for the trademark. Our innovation with iconic brands also went beyond Trademark Coca-Cola. Schweppes grew double digits during the year, boosted by our new adult/mixer offerings. Fuze Tea continued to perform well across the group, now fully lapping its 37-market rollout in January of 2018. We have strong plans in place for the brand heading into 2020 focused on new winter flavors and no sugar antioxidant-infused offerings.These results led to the strongest share gains we\\'ve seen in years across the region, supported both by sparkling and non-sparkling gains. Turning to Asia. A concerted effort to recruit new consumers and drive horizontal expansion helped deliver 5% organic revenue growth for the year. Across Asia, we added 1.4 million new customer outlets, led by our two largest markets in the region, China and India. Our success in China is not just solely based on increased distribution. In order to help expand the consumer base, we\\'ve been adapting to the new digital-first consumer landscape. For example, we launched an integrated Coke and meal campaign with a heavy focus on online food aggregators. This helped us recruit more than 20 million new consumers, boosting our share of online meal ordering to over 60%., Resilience, Latin America,\\nInnovation, Share Gains, Asia, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Actions like these led us to be named the fastest-growing FMCG brand in Asia by Kantar. I\\'ve also been encouraged by the system\\'s response in markets where we face challenges. In Japan, For example, the system moved quickly to rebuild production capacity, following natural disasters in 2018 and stepped up execution performance in order to support our innovation pipeline across the globe. We\\'ve seen that a constant focus on innovation revenue growth management and improved execution, all supported by integrated band building forms the foundation to live a strong results today and in the years ahead. Although we have much room to improve. I\\'m pleased with the progress we\\'ve made across these areas during the year. On innovation, we\\'ve leveraged the strength of our flagship brand while continuing to innovate across the total portfolio. Coke with coffee, launched in 35 additional markets in 2019, is satisfying a new occasion and recruiting consumers back into the brand, driving incremental sales for Coca-Cola Trademark. We\\'ve also launched Coke Energy in select international markets. And while we\\'ve seen some success with the initial rollout, we\\'ll continue to learn how to enhance the consumer proposition as we expand further into 2020, including our recent rollout in the U.S., that tastes a little more like Coke. We\\'re putting the full marketing muscle behind our Coke Energy launch in the U.S., Innovation, Execution,\\nAsia, FMCG Brand, Natural Disasters, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to the juice, dairy and plant-based portfolio. NutriBoost continues to grow strongly across Asia behind our new and innovative functional dairy products for kids and young adults. NutriBoost started as an internal innovation in Vietnam and continues to expand across the region, including its latest launch in Australia. We look to continue accelerating our innovation pipeline in 2020. And just touching on North America, our innovation plans include the launch of AHA sparkling water in March with a distinctive edge in the sparkling water space as two flavor offerings contain caffeine for a little morning or afternoon pick-me-up. We\\'re innovating within our sports drink portfolio as well, with the rollout of POWERADE ULTRA, a breakthrough innovation for the sports drink category with cutting-edge ingredients, including creatine and more electrolytes than original POWERADE. We\\'re also expanding our capabilities through the recent acquisition of fairlife, giving us a strong position in the fast-growing, value-added dairy space. We\\'ve also taken several steps in the ongoing evolution of our revenue growth management agenda. We\\'re strengthening our competitive advantage by making better, more informed decisions and making them faster, translating data into insights and insights into action. Importantly, these insights equip our customers with a new view on how to create value in the beverage category while not dependent on lowering prices to drive foot traffic., Asia, Innovation, North\\nAmerica, Sports Drink, Revenue Growth Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, For example, working with one of our European bottling partners, we added an incremental 100,000 transactions per week for one of our largest customers through insights driven by our RGM capabilities. This kind of collaboration helps drive results, leveraging the power of our consumer insights to support growth for us, our bottling partners and our customers. It\\'s another example of how we create shared value for all who touch the Coca-Cola business. And we\\'re still in the early stages of building out these capabilities and see this as a source of growth for a long time to come. In the end, ultimately though, it comes down to execution, as you can have a fantastic brand, a compelling consumer proposition, but it must be available at the right place at the right time. And execution continues to be based on the fundamentals. For example, in the Philippines, through the placement of more than 10,000 coolers and a 23-point increase in order fulfillment rates, we achieved double-digit volume growth for the year, along with our highest availability coverage and market share in seven years. To support our growth agenda, we\\'ve always been clear that M&A serves as an enabler to our strategy rather than a strategy in of itself. During 2019, we acquired Costa Coffee, which provides us a platform to create a world-class global coffee business. And we\\'re moving with speed to build a strong foundation for long-term value creation under that brand. We started with the launch of ready-to-drink Costa across Europe, already achieving six points of value share in GB within the category., Execution, Availability, Market\\nShare, M&A, Growth Agenda, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve also accelerated placements of Costa Express, our premium self-serve coffee solution, including more than 700 units across key markets in the fourth quarter alone. And we\\'re working closely with our bottling partners to accelerate the total Costa platform in 2020. While I\\'m proud of our team in delivering strong results, I\\'m equally proud of the work we are doing to build a sustainable business for the future. Our initiatives address water stewardship, sugar reduction, women\\'s empowerment and climate. And I\\'ll focus here on our World Without Waste initiative, which includes a number of goals to reduce packaging waste. We\\'ve made steady progress. For example, bottles made with 100% recycled PET are now available in 12 markets with more planned for 2020. Coca-Cola Sweden announced it will be the first market in the world to transition to 100% rPET, 100% recycled PET for all plastic bottles made in the country, a fully circular economy. In 2019, in Western Europe, we used nearly 30% recycled plastic across our total portfolio of PET bottles and are accelerating fast in line with supply. By the end of the year, we project to reach 40% recycled plastics in our bottles in Western Europe, targeting 50% by 2023 and working to increase the recycled content steadily thereafter. Within our flagship U.S. market, we teamed with partners and large competitors to launch Every Bottle Back program, which is designed to improve sorting, processing and collection in areas with the biggest infrastructure gaps. This will help increase the amount of recycled plastic available to be remade into beverage bottles. Speaking more broadly, we are preparing our system for the future with a flexible packaging portfolio., Sustainability, Initiatives,\\nPackaging, Circular Economy, Recycled Plastic, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re investing in innovation to design in sustainable solutions and design out waste, while also reducing our carbon footprint in line with our science-based targets. We\\'re also maintaining a portfolio of aluminum and glass packaging and creating packageless solutions like Freestyle and DASANI PureFill to provide more choice. As we look forward, I\\'m encouraged by the progress the organization is making, progress that gives us confidence in delivering consistent and sustainable financial performance. It\\'s clear that our culture shift is gaining traction as we continue to raise the performance bar across the organization. Looking at the bigger picture, our success comes down to our ability to craft the beverage brands that people love and to refresh them in body and spirit. We strive to do this in ways that create a more sustainable business and a better shared future that makes a difference in people\\'s lives, communities and our planet. Simply put, it\\'s about loved brands done sustainably for a better shared future, and I look forward to sharing more with you at upcoming CAGNY., Sustainability, Innovation, Portfolio,\\nCulture Shift, Financial Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re investing in innovation to design in sustainable solutions and design out waste, while also reducing our carbon footprint in line with our science-based targets.

Press Release covered a fourth quarter results in detail picture we saw another quarter of solid results with 7% top line growth, translating into double digit operating income growth factor in timing of shipments. And the extra day in the quarter, the top line is closer to a 6%. net of these factors in line with our full year, top line results that I will focus. Some of the progress we\\'ve been making on our priorities. While is on our 2020 guidance. On the top line, we continue to see a strong response from the strategic actions we\\'ve been taking, now in the second year of delivering at the mid to high end of our long-term growth algorithm with contribution from both volume and price/mix. Delivering quality top line growth is translating into underlying margin expansion and profit growth. For 2019, we achieved underlying operating margin expansion of 150 basis points driven by top line acceleration and leveraging our cost base through productivity initiatives. We expanded margins even as we accelerated reinvestments in the business, helping us to drive double-digit profit growth on a currency-neutral basis. Comparable operating margin compressed by approximately 100 basis points as underlying expansion was more than offset by a combined approximate 250 basis point headwind from currency and acquisitions., Growth,\\nPriorities, Margin Expansion, Reinvestments, Currency Impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Free cash flow has been a particular area of focus this past year, enabling us to deliver $8.4 billion during the year, up 38% from the prior year and well ahead of our plan. We achieved this through accelerating our underlying performance, capturing working capital initiatives, a reduction in productivity and reinvestment costs and more disciplined use of our capital spend. Our progress on cash is a good example of when the organization is clear on the opportunity and the drivers to achieve it. And as we\\'ve seen, the results can sometimes exceed even our own expectations. Turning to the 2020 outlook. Based on the progress we\\'ve been making and the plans we have in place, we expect to achieve results well within our long-term growth targets for revenue, profit and earnings per share for 2020. importantly, we expect to deliver meaningful U.S. dollar EPS growth. Specifically, we expect organic growth -- organic revenue growth of approximately 5% and comparable currency-neutral operating income growth of approximately 8%. Key drivers of our operational outlook center around our continued focus on innovation, revenue growth management and improved execution, all supported by a comprehensive approach to brand building. James highlighted a few aspects of the innovation pipeline, and we continue to get sharper on how to better connect our revenue growth management initiatives into an integrated execution strategy in the marketplace that delivers on both the top and the bottom line. From a macro perspective, although volatility remains in certain spots around the world, we do expect consumer spending to remain healthy for 2020 and expect the emerging and developing world to outpace developed markets similar to 2019., Cash Flow,\\nGrowth, Innovation, Execution, Macro Perspective, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of currency, based on the latest rates, our hedged positions and our forecasted business mix, we anticipate a zero to one point headwind on revenue and a 2- to 3-point headwind at operating income. These headwinds are inclusive of cycling any hedging gains in 2019, which, as noted in the past, were minimal. Considering these factors, we expect comparable earnings per share of approximately $2.25 for 2020, a 7% increase from the prior year. We also expect to generate approximately $8 billion of free cash flow for 2020 through $10 billion in cash from operations and $2 billion in capital investments. Cash generation will be driven by continued strong underlying performance, capturing further working capital benefits, further reduction in productivity and reinvestment costs and even more disciplined use of capital spend., Currency\\nImpact, Earnings Per Share, Free Cash Flow, Working Capital, Capital Investments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 4, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We remain consistent on our disciplined capital allocation program, which balances financial flexibility with efficient capital structure. Specifically, we\\'ll continue to invest -- reinvest the cash generated to support our growth agenda. We\\'ll also continue to return cash to shareowners by growing the dividend. And after investing for growth and delivering on our dividend commitments, we intend to use the excess cash to repurchase shares over time. My last point to cover is timing considerations for our 2020 outlook as we expect the majority of growth to occur in the back half of the year. The two biggest factors are: First, we have one less day in the first quarter and two additional days in the fourth quarter. And second, we will be cycling the impact from our European bottlers increasing their safety stock in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit earlier in 2019. This was a benefit to revenue growth in the first quarter of 2019 and then was subsequently reversed in the fourth quarter. The cycling effect will create a natural headwind for the first quarter of 2020 and a tailwind in the fourth quarter. So in summary, we are pleased with our 2019 results and confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments for 2020. We\\'re also very clear on the direction we are heading as a system and well equipped to execute on the strategies to get us there. Operator, we are now ready for questions., Capital Allocation,\\nGrowth Agenda, Dividend Commitments, Timing Considerations, Strategic Execution, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks Tim. Good morning everyone. As you\\'ll have seen from our earnings release earlier today, we continue to deliver strong results. We are part of a great industry with solid long-term growth potential. For our Company, that power on aligned and engaged system is driving solid top line growth across all our operating segments., Strong Results,\\nGrowth Potential, Aligned System, Top Line Growth, Company Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We see that innovation, revenue growth management and improving execution all supported by greater brand building are helping us sustained momentum across our business. Our associates within the organization and across the system are responding to the cultural changes we are driving., Innovation,\\nRevenue Growth Management, Execution, Brand Building, Cultural Changes, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, So, through the three quarters of the year, we\\'ve gained global value share with a balanced contribution from both developed and emerging markets. We\\'re sustaining that solid top-line performance with growth across all the operating segments and we\\'re on track to deliver our EPS commitments as momentum in the business has helped offset increased currency headwinds, and as John will talk about, free cash flow is up strongly year-to-date, which is also encouraging., Top-Line\\nPerformance, EPS Commitments, Currency Headwinds, Free Cash Flow, Business Momentum, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Looking around the world, as I said, all our operating segments delivered solid organic growth. In EMEA, we\\'ve seen sustained revenue growth of 7% year to date. Importantly, we\\'re seeing contributions to grow income as much from developed markets as the emerging markets. This is partly due to our revenue growth management efforts over the last few years and it\\'s pretty encouraging as we continue to roll out these revenue growth management initiatives to develop markets in other areas of the world., Organic\\nGrowth, EMEA Performance, Revenue Growth Management, Emerging Markets, Income Contributions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Asia-Pacific, we\\'ve grown organic revenue 4% year-to-date. We\\'re gaining horizontal distribution and recruiting new consumers in emerging markets like Southeast Asia, India and China, leading to strong volume growth. In Japan, while we still have work to do, we are seeing sequential quarterly improvement in both volume and revenue. The system continues to rebuild manufacturing capacity and we\\'re adapting to fast changing consumer environment and evolving our operating model to drive efficiencies and effectiveness., Asia-Pacific\\nPerformance, Organic Revenue Growth, Emerging Markets, Volume Growth, System Rebuilding, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to Latin America, again, we\\'re driving positive momentum despite a more challenging economic environment, and they\\'re up 9% organic growth year-to-date. Brazil has sustained strong performance even as the macros have slowed a little in the third quarter. This has been driven by improved execution and consistent investment behind cold drink equipments. Our approach has enabled the business to grow at twice the rate of consumer spending in the third quarter., Positive\\nMomentum, Latin America Performance, Organic Growth, Execution, Investment Behind Cold Drink\\nEquipments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our business in Mexico has actively adjusted to a more challenging economic environment, shifting the portfolio toward affordability with a push on returnable packaging. This has led to improvement in trends as we move through the year., Adjusting to\\nEconomic Environment, Shifting Portfolio, Affordability, Returnable Packaging, Improvement in\\nTrends, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Argentina though, a worsening economic situation and higher inflation has affected consumer spending, impacting our business and our industry. However, by following our playbook of carefully balancing price increases, while also focusing on maintaining our consumer base, we have gained value share year-to-date., Economic\\nSituation, Consumer Spending, Value Share Gain, Price Increases, Playbook, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, turning to North America, we saw strong marketplace performance, driven by innovation in our sparkling portfolio and improving performance in stills. We also continue to gain share, and so far, revenue growth -- organic revenue growth is up 2% year-to-date. This growth was largely driven by continued strong consumer demand for No Sugar versions of some of our best known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for smaller packages with less sugar per serving., Strong\\nMarketplace Performance, Innovation, Organic Revenue Growth, Consumer Demand, Small Packages, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Of course, we always have the opportunity to get better. For example, our performance in the water category has not been as strong as we\\'d like. We\\'re working on further plans to address this in the marketplace in the near future. Taking a step back and looking across all our markets, we are driving a platform for sustained performance through a disciplined portfolio growth approach, an aligned and engaged system, and collaboration with our stakeholders. Within our portfolio, we focus on operationalizing further our leader, challenger and explorer framework to build quality leadership positions in more brands in more markets., Opportunity\\nfor Improvement, Water Category Performance, Platform for Sustained Performance, Disciplined\\nPortfolio Growth Approach, Aligned and Engaged System, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, While consumer behavior is rapidly evolving, we continue to find new ways to connect with consumers through our leader brands. For example, we see continued strong performance in our sparkling portfolio, led by trademark Coca-Cola with 3% volume growth and 6% retail value growth so far this year. Our brands and formula has been around for more than 130 years and we continually work to make Coke relevant to recruit new generations of consumers., Leader Brands,\\nSparkling Portfolio, Consumer Behavior, Relevant Brands, New Generations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In addition to great marketing campaigns, consumer-centric innovation has been a key factor, especially over the last few years. This includes smaller packaging such as mini cans, which are growing at a rate of more than 15% year to date in the US. It includes lower and no calorie variants that help consumers moderate their sugar intake., Innovation,\\nConsumer-Centric Innovation, Smaller Packaging, Lower and No Calorie Variants, Marketeting\\nCampaigns, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, For example Coke Zero Sugar is growing globally 14% volume year-to-date, and most recently it\\'s included new launches such as Coke Energy and Coke Plus Coffee, which is designed for consumers looking for a little extra upliftment. We\\'ve launched Coke Energy in more than 25 markets and we\\'re adjusting, as we learn, to how consumers are responding. As you know we have plans to bring Coke Energy to the US in 2020. Overall, we are seeing more consumers drink products from our flagship trademark globally., Coke Zero\\nSugar, New Launches, Global Growth, Consumer Response, US Expansion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Within challenger and explorer brands, innovation and sustained investment levels are helping drive performance across key geographies. In Asia, our Authentic Tea House brand is well ahead of the plan in China and across Southeast Asia. At the beginning of last year, we launched Fuze Tea in Europe. Now, entering its second year, we\\'ve seen positive momentum in both revenue growth and share gains, driven by marketing investments, innovation and added distribution., Innovation,\\nSustained Investment, Geographies, Marketing Investments, Distribution, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Fuze Tea has gained 3 points of value share across Western Europe, showing the importance of sustained investments to build challenger brands into leaders. Chi, West Africa\\'s leading value added dairy and juice brand continues to perform well in the marketplace and expanded footprint across the region. The disciplined approach we\\'re taking is yielding results. Consumers have responded, as shown by our sustained momentum., Sustained\\nInvestments, Challenger Brands, Marketplace Performance, Disciplined Approach, Consumer Response, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, More broadly, we will continue to invest behind our brands. Of course, strategy and marketing are only one part of the equation. Daily execution in the marketplace is also a critical component. Globally, our bottling partners are aligned and energized. They\\'re committed to building scale and investing for the future. We are working with them to collectively raise the bar on consistent execution. Key levers of growth include driving new pack price architectures, increasing the availability of immediate consumption packages, expanding chill space with more cold drink equipment and growing our customer base., Investment,\\nStrategy, Execution, Growth Levers, Partnership, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In India, for example, immediate consumption transactions have grown double digits year-to-date, fueled by adding more than 650,000 new customer outlets during the year and placing more than 25 additional coolers in the market. These initiatives are allowing us to grow at double the rate of personal consumption expenditure., Growth, India,\\nCustomer Outlets, New Coolers, Personal Consumption Expenditure, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Globally, this kind of action has helped lead to volume growth in immediate consumption packages of 4% year-to-date. Fundamentally, our business is driven by the ability to operate a more sustainable enterprise that makes a difference for all our -- all our stakeholders. And let me highlight one critical issue we of course see across the world, which is packaged waste. We first shared our World Without Waste goals in 2018 and we provided updates from time to time, but I also like to share a recent example of initiatives around the world., Growth,\\nImmediate Consumption Packages, Sustainability, Stakeholders, Packaged Waste, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the US, we\\'re working on a number of packaging plants designing, including removing the equivalent of at least 1 billion virgin PET plastic bottles from the supply chain, over the next five years. Dasani will introduce a lineup of recyclable, reusable and package free options, including aluminium packages and expansion of PureFill water dispensers, which leverage our Coca-Cola Freestyle technology., Packaging,\\nSupply Chain, Recyclable, Reusable, PureFill, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Great Britain, our system has switched Sprite bottles from Green to clear plastic, to make them easier to recycle into new bottles. And in 2020, we will double the recycled plastic in all of our bottles in Great Britain to at least 50%. In Australia, by the end of the year, all single-serve PET bottles will be made from a 100% recycled plastic., Recycling,\\nPlastic Bottles, Great Britain, Australia, Sustainability, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, we and our partners just unveiled the first sample bottle made with recovered and recycled Marine plastics. This shows the future potential for ocean debride to be recycled packaging for foods and drinks. Of course, none of this will be possible without the people throughout our company and our system that take an expansive approach to imagining what\\'s possible. This is what gives me confidence in this company and the system at building a better shared future., Recycled\\nPlastic, Marine Plastics, Sustainability, People, Future Potential, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, So in summary, we\\'re driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth, an aligned and engaged system, and are working with our stakeholders. For the first nine months of the year, we delivered the strong underlying growth ahead of our initial guidance. This gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year EPS target and drive shareholder value., Growth,\\nSustainability, Stakeholders, Performance, Shareholder Value, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I\\'d like to start with a quick update on a few key areas of focus, I\\'ve mentioned previously that are critical to the company; driving sustainable top line growth, expanding margins across our business segments, and improving cash flow., Growth,\\nSustainability, Margins, Cash Flow, Business Segments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As I look at our progress in 2019, our top line continues to respond to the actions James has just spoken to, also to dive innovation, revenue growth management and improved execution, and all supported by a comprehensive range of brand building initiatives across the world., Brand\\nBuilding, Innovation, Revenue Growth Management, Execution, Progress, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Organic revenue was up 6% year-to-date and we\\'ve reached the ninth consecutive quarter of being within our long-term target. Our healthy top line and effective cost management are translating into solid underlying operating margin expansion across all three areas of the business; our geographic segments, Global Ventures and Bottling Investments., Organic\\nRevenue, Long-term Target, Geographic Segments, Underlying Operating Margin Expansion, Bottling\\nInvestments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, And we\\'re doing this while continuing to invest in our brands. We\\'ve made steady progress in improving our free cash flow position, which is up 41% year to date. We\\'re achieving this through solid underlying performance acting on working capital initiatives, in addition to tapering off our productivity and restructuring costs. Our progress has enabled us to grow in line with our earnings per share expectations, despite an 8 point currency headwind setting us up to meet our guidance for the year., Underlying\\nPerformance, Free Cash Flow, Working Capital Initiatives, Productivity and Restructuring Costs,\\nEarnings Per Share Expectations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We are pleased that the business is responding to the actions we\\'ve been taking, but as always, we aim to do better. We will continue to make the right investments in the business to sustain this momentum into the future., Momentum,\\nInvestments, Sustainability, Future, Business, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to our financial performance for the quarter, we delivered solid 5% organic revenue growth with contributions across all operating segments. As expected, revenue growth was driven by strong price mix due to our revenue growth management initiatives in the marketplace along with some items we are cycling from the prior year., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Operating Segments, Price Mix, Revenue Growth Management Initiatives, Prior Year\\nCycling, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The biggest driver of these items was cycling increased inventory levels in our Brazilian bottlers from last year. This puts more than 2 points of pressure on concentrate sales in the quarter. And this was partially offset by a corresponding price mix benefit as our Brazilian business revenue per case is lower than the company average., Inventory\\nLevels, Concentrate Sales, Price Mix, Brazilian Business, Revenue Per Case, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We are also cycling the timing of certain deductions in the third quarter of last year, which was a slight benefit to price mix in the quarter; however, no impact on the year-to-date performance. So adjusting for these items, I would look at this quarter\\'s 5% organic revenue growth as being on an apples-to-apples basis 1% volume and 4% price mix., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Price Mix, Volume, Timing of Deductions, Apples-to-Apples Basis, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Underlying gross margin expanded about 120 basis points during the quarter, with contribution across our geographic segments, Global Ventures and Bottling Investments. Operating margin was roughly even, on an underlying basis, negatively impacted by cycling the timing of expenses and concentrate shipments in the prior year, in addition to the timing of certain items in the current year, including investments in marketing., Underlying\\nGross Margin, Geographic Segments, Global Ventures, Bottling Investments, Operating Margin, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This translated to 5% growth in comparable currency-neutral operating income, which was more than offset by a stronger than anticipated 7% currency headwind. Comparable EPS declined 2% in the quarter, impacted by a 6 point currency headwind., Growth,\\nCurrency Headwind, Comparable EPS, Currency Impact, Operating Income, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, with the momentum we see in the business, we\\'re now guiding to organic revenue growth of at least 5%. This is translating into stronger underlying profit growth and an increase in our free cash flow guidance to at least $6.5 billion. Our underlying performance allows us to maintain our full-year comparable EPS guidance even in the face of increasing currency headwinds compared to previous expectations., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Underlying Profit Growth, Free Cash Flow Guidance, Comparable EPS Guidance, Currency\\nHeadwinds, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Staying on currency for a moment, on the second quarter call we provided initial review -- view of 2020, namely that based on rates at the time we expected a benign outlook. Since then, the dollar has strengthened which has impacted our outlook for next year. Based on those recent movements, there will be an approximate 1 point to 2 point currency headwind at revenue, and given the natural multiplier effect due to business mix, a 2 point to 3 point headwind at operating income for full year 2020. This is almost entirely from movement in market rates as our hedging gains and losses in 2019 are minimal so far., Currency\\nHeadwind, Outlook for 2020, Impact on Revenue, Impact on Operating Income, Hedging Gains and Losses, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, With respect to our hedging program, we are nearly 100% hedged for the G10 currencies in 2020. But we have minimal hedges today for our non-G10 currencies. It goes without saying that several geopolitical factors can have an impact on our currency outlook between now and when we provide our full 2020 guidance in February., Hedging\\nProgram, Currency Outlook, Geopolitical Factors, Full 2020 Guidance, Non-G10 Currencies, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Coming back to 2019, in quarter four, there are a couple of things you should consider. First, we have an additional day in the fourth quarter which adds about a point of revenue growth. Second, we expect an estimated 2 point headwind to topline growth, biggest factor being the reduction in inventory levels by our European bottlers. You may recall that in the first quarter price mix and concentrate shipments benefited from those bottlers increasing their safety stocks in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit., Additional\\nDay, Revenue Growth, Headwind to Topline Growth, Inventory Levels, European Bottlers, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We currently expect this to fully reverse in quarter four. But of course it\\'s subject to the pending Brexit outcome. The net of these two will result in a one point headwind to topline growth for the quarter., Brexit,\\nRevenue Growth, Topline Growth, Quarter Four, Pending Outcome, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 3, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, So in summary, we are pleased with the momentum we have in the business. We continue to invest for sustainable growth in the future and we remain very focused on raising the performance bar everywhere to capture the opportunity available to us., Momentum,\\nInvestment, Sustainable Growth, Performance Bar, Opportunity, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim and good morning everyone. So here we are halfway through the year and we see good momentum in our business, as we continue our transformation as a total beverage Company. We gained global value share with a balanced contribution from both developed and emerging markets, led by a strong performance in our sparkling soft drink business., Momentum,\\nTransformation, Global Value Share, Sparkling Soft Drink Business, Emerging Markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Organic revenue growth is up 6% year-to-date including growth across all operating segments and with a good balance between volume and pricing. Worth noting about a point of that is due to the benefit of timing, the underlying results that was still ahead of plan. Unit case growth, volume grew 2% year-to-date and 3% in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral EPS was up 13% year-to-date, partially offset by a stronger than unanticipated 9% currency headwind resulting in comparable EPS growth of 3%. While currencies continue to be a headwind, we are focused on achieving our full-year EPS target through stronger performance in the underlying business., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Operating Segments, Volume and Pricing, Comparable Currency Neutral EPS, Full-Year\\nEPS Target, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Looking around the world, we delivered strong top line growth in the first half driven by both developed and emerging markets. In Asia Pacific, we grew organic revenue 4% during the first half of the year. Strong revenue -- strong performance in emerging markets like India, Southeast Asia and China drove 7% volume growth for the segment, as we focused on underserved consumption occasions., Strong Top\\nLine Growth, Emerging Markets, Organic Revenue Growth, Volume Growth, Focused Underserved\\nConsumption Occasions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This was partially offset by performance in Japan, where our system continues to work through supply chain disruptions stemming from last year\\'s natural disasters. In addition, volume declined in Japan during the second quarter, as our system implemented the first price increase to consumers in over 25 years. Looking ahead, we expect improving results in the back half as consumers adjust the new pricing levels and we implement a robust innovation plan including Coke Energy and innocent chilled juice., Supply Chain\\nDisruptions, Price Increase, Improving Results, New Pricing Levels, Robust Innovation Plan, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to EMEA. Here we grew organic revenue 9% year-to-date, driven by continued growth in Europe and Turkey. Improved performance in South Africa and the first quarter benefit from our shipment timing. Across Europe, revenue growth management initiatives and Zero Sugar innovations are creating sustained momentum in the majority of our markets, as shown by the 3% volume growth in our European sparkling soft drink portfolio. And in Turkey, despite the challenging macro environment, we are delivering solid performance due to strong marketing and execution plans that are quickly adapting to the local conditions., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Europe, Turkey, Volume Growth, Sustained Momentum, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to Latin America. Here, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth year-to-date at mid -- a mixed operating environment. Brazil continues to deliver strong performance driven by better execution within a stable operating environment, while Argentina continues to grapple with the economic crisis. Mexico\\'s economic growth is slowing, so we expect tougher operating conditions. However, we are adjusting our plans to ensure affordability to show that the business continues to grow sustainably., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, turning to North America, here our results continue to mount steady progress, driven by improved marketing and execution. Our performance was largely driven by consumer demand for No Sugar versions of some of our best known sparkling soft drink brand, as well as for the smaller packages with less sugar. Retail sales of our No Sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio grew 6% in the quarter in Nielsen measured channels., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, North America, Consumer Demand, No Sugar Versions, Retail Sales, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Strong revenue growth for our core sparkling soft drink brands continues to fuel and enable new innovations and investments across our expanding total beverage portfolio. For example, our premium water brands, Smartwater and Topo Chico delivering healthy growth supported by the national launch of Smartwater antioxidant and Smartwater outline and the ongoing strategic expansion of Topo Chico., Strong Revenue\\nGrowth, Core Sparkling Soft Drink Brands, New Innovations, Premium Water Brands, National Launch, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Across all of our markets, we are driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth, an aligned and engaged system and collaboration with our stakeholders. Beginning with our portfolio growth, here, we are making progress in operationalizing our leader, challenger and explorer framework consistent with the strategy we outlined last year. Within our leaders, the core sparkling soft drink business registered healthy volume growth of 2% year-to-date, with Trademark Coke continuing to perform very well, with volume up 3% year-to-date and 4% in the quarter, fueling portfolio expansion. Importantly, we are seeing healthy household penetration growth for our sparkling soft drink portfolio. While it\\'s also encouraging is Coke Zero Sugar is now in its third year of double-digit volume growth. Along with a focus on smaller packaging and premium innovation, year-to-date we are growing Trademark Coke revenue faster than transactions, transactions faster than volume and reducing calories what we believe is a winning strategy for the future., Portfolio\\nGrowth, Sparkling Soft Drink Business, Trademark Coke, Household Penetration Growth, Premium\\nInnovation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our innovation pipeline, our innovation pipeline for Coke Trademark expanded in April with the launch of Coke Energy, offering the edge of a great refreshing taste and an inclusive brand. The energy occasion is fast growing and expanding in multiple spaces to satisfy more consumers. We remain fully committed to our partnership with Monster and we believe there are opportunities to capture even more value in the energy category for the Coca-Cola system and to bring new drinkers into a rapidly evolving category. The initial results are encouraging., Innovation\\nPipeline, Coke Trademark, Launch of Coke Energy, Energy Occasion, Partnership with Monster, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In Spain, the first market where Coke Energy was launched has already captured 2% share of the energy category in modern trade and it has achieved similar sales for the last outlet as the market leader with strong repeat levels that indicate good consumer acceptance. We\\'re taking everything we\\'ve learned and applying these insights as we rapidly scale Coke Energy across our system. We are currently in 14 countries and by the end of 2019, we expect to have Coke Energy available in 20 markets., Coke Energy,\\nShare of Energy Category, Modern Trade, Consumer Acceptance, Global Expansion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Coke Energy along with many of our other innovations are being created to target specific occasions and need states, but in very different ways particularly as we -- as we grow our challenges and explorers. For example, in Australia, we recently launched NutriBoost after learning from it\\'s success in Vietnam. NutriBoost is a nutritious milk drink with zero added sugar that was designed for busy families looking for a mid-morning or afternoon energizing snack., Coke Energy,\\nInnovations, Occasions and Need States, Australia, NutriBoost, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, With this our focus on consumer centric innovation almost 25% of our revenue is now from new or reformulated products up from 15% two years ago. At the same time, we are taking a disciplined approach to curating our portfolio to ensure we have the capacity to focus on the right brands. So far this year, over 275 zombie SKUs have been eliminated. We\\'re also making progress on our plans to build a multi-platform coffee business, since we finalized the Costa acquisition in January, we\\'ve been moving with speed across three areas integrating cost into our business, making sure cost is existing, plans are executed well and accelerating the opportunity to build a multi-platform business., Consumer\\nCentric Innovation, Revenue Growth, Portfolio Curation, Zombie SKUs Elimination, Costa Acquisition, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As we move forward on these opportunities, our focus is on accelerating three segments, the Express vending machines, beans and machines for foodservice customers and ready-to-drink products. We\\'ve already launched ready-to-drink products in the UK, we plan to roll out in additional markets in the coming months. And consistent with our other innovations ready-to-drink Costa leverage is a unique brand and product edge that will allow into capture category growth. We are already -- we are also accelerating our plans to roll out more Express machines across a number of markets. So far this year, we\\'ve placed 1,200 new vending machines and have plans for many more by the end of the year., Accelerating\\nGrowth, Express Vending Machines, Ready-to-Drink Products, Costa Leverage, Market Expansion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, as you may have seen last week, we reached an agreement with Coca-Cola Hellenic to launch Costa coffee across a number of formats within all that markets over the next three years., Costa Coffee,\\nAgreement with Coca-Cola Hellenic, Market Expansion, Formats, Launch, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Returning to the overall view, of course, none of this works without our bottling partners. Globally, our bottling partners are aligned and energized, they\\'re committed to building scale and investing for the future and we\\'re working with them to collectively raise the bar on our consistent execution. I told before about the revenue growth management initiatives which are helping to drive increased velocity in our portfolio. Coupled with this has been a focus on expanding horizontal distribution through opening new outlets and placing more cold drink equipments and we\\'re making progress, especially in Asia, where our system opened over 750,000 new outlets so far this year., Bottling\\nPartners, Global Execution, Revenue Growth Management, Horizontal Distribution, Asia Expansion, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, However, gaining penetration is only part of the equation. Consistently measuring and managing our performance in existing outlets is the other part that drive sustained performance. So we are working to better leverage data and mobile technology and also evolve our right execution daily platform from a point in time scorecard into a real time integrated analytics capability that will drive faster and better formed execution decisions across our system., Data and\\nMobile Technology, Performance Measurement and Management, Existing Outlets, Real-Time Analytics,\\nExecution Decisions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Before moving off our bottling system, let me quickly address our plans in Africa. In May, we announced that we were stepping back from our plans to refranchise Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. Instead, we will hold onto the bottler until we move through a period of political and economic change in the region. But to be clear, our bottling ownership philosophy hasn\\'t changed, as with all our bottling Investments, we will look to sell at the right time to the right buyer. In the meantime, we have a new and energized leadership teams on both sides of the system and we are already seeing promising results., Africa Plans,\\nBottling System, Political and Economic Change, Leadership Teams, Selling Bottling Investments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, in order to deliver long-term sustainable growth, we must collaborate with our stakeholders. One critical issue facing the world is plastic waste. In 2018, we announced that World Without Waste goals the recycling recyclable packaging and the use of recycled material. As noted in our earnings release, we are making progress against our goals. We used approximately 30% recycled material in our packaging globally in 2018. We now have a 100% recycled PET bottles in the market in over half a dozen countries with more launches planned in 2019., Sustainability, Recycling, Packaging, Growth, Stakeholders, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And importantly, our system is also working to improve collection. We currently refill or collect equivalent of 50% -- 58% of what we sell in the marketplace. While global traction will take time given the need for infrastructure investments and various regulations by upmarket, we are actively working to lift and shift successful collection models such as PETCO in South Africa, in COSIA, Mexico and Coca-Cola Amatil is already leading our collaboration to run a deposit return schemes across all of its territories in Australia., Collection, Infrastructure, Regulations, Global Traction, Collaboration, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, James Quincey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ultimately, the heart of our success are our people. We\\'ve been working to continue to build out growth culture is that is what will drive our performance year-after-year moving faster, taking intelligent risks and learning from our mistakes. And I think this is beginning to show in our results. So in summary, we had a good first half of the year as evidenced by our solid organic growth rate. We are driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth, an aligned and engaged system and collaboration with our stakeholders. And the momentum in our business gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year EPS target and drive shareholder value., People, Growth\\nCulture, Performance, Mistakes, Stakeholders, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James and thanks to all of you for joining us. Before addressing our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, I\\'d like to start by discussing a few key areas that I believe are critical to the Company, specifically driving healthy top line growth, expanding margins across our business segments, improving cash flow and leveraging a disciplined capital allocation process., Growth,\\nMargins, Cash Flow, Capital Allocation, Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, James has talked about our revenue growth management effort. This quarter, we\\'ve continued to scale our work in both Asia and Latin America. We\\'re implementing better analytical tools and processes to develop, price pack architectures to meet evolving consumer and customer needs and is showing results, contributing to the robust organic revenue growth we\\'ve delivered now for the past eight quarters., Revenue\\nGrowth, Implementation, Tools, Processes, Consumer Needs, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Translating top line performance into sustainable margin improvement is for our ongoing productivity efforts and leader challenger explorer framework come into play. For the first half of the year, we delivered underlying operating margin improvement, a function of continued innovation, revenue growth management strategies and the effective management of our cost structure. We\\'ve also advanced our efforts to improve cash flow and capital allocation. We\\'re improving our working capital as evidenced by our year-to-date cash flow increase. We\\'re taking a close look at all assets on our balance sheet. For example, we\\'re in the process of selling our building in New York and we recently divested our equity stake in our Peruvian bottler. And we are reducing the sizable costs related to our productivity program that were part of the transformation of our business. So we\\'re making progress and we aim to do even better., Translation, Sustainability, Innovation, Cost Management, Cash Flow, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning now to our financial performance in the quarter. We delivered another solid quarter with broad-based organic revenue growth, underlying margin expansion and improving cash flow trends. Organic revenue grew 6% with a healthy balance of price mix and volume and a 1.0 benefit from timing. Our developing and emerging markets drove strong volume performance, which resulted in strong growth in our Bottling Investments Group. The continued roll out of revenue growth management initiatives across our developed markets resulted in good price mix., Financial\\nPerformance, Organic Revenue Growth, Margin Expansion, Cash Flow Trends, Developing and Emerging\\nMarkets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Comparable margins contracted in the second quarter due to the impact of acquisitions and currency. However, both growth and operating margins expanded on an underlying basis. This translated into 14% currency neutral operating income growth, partially offset by an 8.0 currency headwind. The currency impact to operating income included a 2.0 impact from hedging activity driven entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year. Comparable EPS grew 4% in the quarter, which was comprised of 13% comparable currency-neutral growth, partially offset by a stronger than expected 9% currency headwind., Acquisitions,\\nCurrency Impact, Operating Margins, Growth, EPS, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, And finally, year-to-date free cash flow was up $3.7 billion, up 87% due largely to strong underlying growth, working capital initiatives and the timing of cash taxes and capital expenditures. While we do not expect a similar increase in the back half of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver at least $6 billion in free cash flow., Free Cash\\nFlow, Growth, Working Capital, Taxes, Capital Expenditures, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now looking at the remainder of the year for the first half, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth. And as James noted about a point of this came from the timing of shipments, which we expect to reverse in the back half. So after normalizing for the timing benefit, the best way to think about our underlying top line performance for the first half is 5%. Considering this strong performance, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue to 5% for the full year, which is translating into stronger underlying profit performance and that better underlying performance is enabling us to maintain our full-year comparable EPS guidance even as currencies have gotten worse and structural changes are less of a benefit when we expect this at the beginning of the year., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Timing Benefit, Full-Year Guidance, Underlying Profit Performance, Currency Impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As you model the flow of the year, there is a few items to consider in terms of phasing, due to cycling the timing of shipments and expenses, moderating currency headwinds and an extra day in the fourth quarter. We expect all of the comparable operating income growth in the back half of the year to occur in the fourth quarter. Specific to currency in the third quarter, we expect a 6.0 currency impact to operating income. This includes a 3.0 impact from hedging activity, driven almost entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year, as year-over-year spot rate headwinds are softening., Phasing,\\nCurrency Impact, Operating Income Growth, Timing of Shipments and Expenses, Fourth Quarter\\nPerformance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As we move through the back half of the year, we expect the impact from currencies to become less of a headwind, looking even further at current spot rates and hedge positions, we expect a benign currency environment in 2020 compared to 2019. As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to answer any questions, as you build out your models for the year., Currency\\nImpact, Benign Environment, Spot Rates, Hedge Positions, Investor Relations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 2, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, So in summary, we\\'ve had a strong first half of the year. Our strategies are driving strong performance in our business. Cash flow is improving and we remain very focused on delivering our full year EPS guidance., Strong\\nPerformance, Business Strategies, Cash Flow, Full-Year Guidance, Focus, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2019 is off to a good start with strong underlying performance as we leveraged our transformation as a total beverage Company. We continue to win in a growing industry. The non-alcoholic ready to drink beverage industry grew value 4% in the quarter and we gained global value share with a balance contribution from both developed and emerging markets led by strong performance within our sparkling soft drink business., Strong\\nUnderlying Performance, Growing Industry, Global Value Share, Sparkling Soft Drink Business, Total\\nBeverage Company, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, During the quarter, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, cycling 5% last year. Growth was broad-based with positive performance across each of our operating segments. Of course, there are often timing impacts on a quarterly basis, and we did see a net benefit in this quarter, which John will cover in more detail. But to be clear, we delivered strong top line growth in the quarter, which we converted into 16% comparable currency neutral operating income growth and comparable EPS was up 2%, which was comprised of 13% comparable currency neutral EPS growth, partially offset by an 11% currency headwind., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Operating Segments, Timing Impacts, Comparable Currency Neutral Operating Income\\nGrowth, Comparable EPS Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, So, our disciplined growth strategies are working well and we\\'re on track to deliver our full year guidance. As you know, our industry continues to evolve and our approach to addressing this encompasses our system acting with discipline to drive growth., Disciplined\\nGrowth Strategies, Full-Year Guidance, Industry Evolution, System Acting, Discipline, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, First, innovating and investing in our core categories and brands as well as in emerging spaces. This encompasses everything from massive categories like hot beverages to emerging ones like kombucha. And it allows us to proactively address innovation opportunities that stem from blurring category lines., Innovation,\\nInvestment, Core Categories, Emerging Spaces, Category Lines, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Second, we\\'re looking at how we operate as a Company from our existing geographic segments to our new global ventures segment., Operating As A\\nCompany, Geographic Segments, New Global Ventures Segment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Third, our system is aligned and engaged with improved execution. Our bottling partners are investing for growth, including cold-drink equipment at incremental feet on the street as well as implementing more segmented revenue growth strategies., Tenth,\\nExecution, Bottling Partners, Growth Strategies, Cold-Drink Equipment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, At the same time, we\\'re investing in digital capabilities to engage with consumers, interact with our customers and reduced costs across our enterprise., Digital\\nCapabilities, Consumer Engagement, Customer Interaction, Cost Reduction, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, So I\\'ll start with our brands. Constant innovation is crucial for sustained growth. Brand Coke, which includes our flagship product and its many variants has momentum, because it has been continually updated to maintain its relevance., Brand Coke,\\nInnovation, Sustained Growth, Flagship Product, Variants, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Over the past three years, innovation has helped accelerate global retail value growth each year including up to 6% growth in 2018., Innovation,\\nGlobal Retail Value Growth, Three Years, Acceleration, 2018, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, This growth is in large part, because of the success of Coke Zero Sugar, which didn\\'t happen of course overnight. We refined and expanded Zero Sugar over time, and we see more growth ahead. Coke Zero Sugar succeeds because it builds on the brand age of original Coke, on its taste, its upliftments, on the energy boost that the product provides, all this in a product that doesn\\'t have calories or sugar. So what\\'s next for Brand Coke, you\\'ll see us continue to innovate to capture additional consumption occasions in these days., Coke Zero\\nSugar, Growth, Taste, Energy Boost, Innovation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, One example that I\\'ve talked about before is Coca-Cola Coffee, which we tested in several Asian markets last year. Coke Coffee was designed to reach consumers during specific occasions and channels like the mid-afternoon energy slump of work. We\\'ve learned from these pilots and we now plan to launch in more than 25 markets around the world by year-end., Coca-Cola\\nCoffee, Testing, Asian Markets, Launch, Energy Slump, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also pursuing another logical extension on the Coca-Cola brand without test of Coke Energy, this takes one of the original brand edges of coke with energy boost to a new level and a new taste.This product is designed for the white spaces where the energy category is well developed. But our approach to innovation is not limited to brand Coke, we\\'re taking other brands and pushing into new spaces to offer consumers what they want by leveraging the brand edges. For example Innocent, our leading juice business in Europe, expanded into plant-based beverages and within our challenger brands, Simply, our premium juice brand in the US recently launched a new line of smoothies. We\\'re also improving the way we operationalize our innovation pipeline. Within our broad explorer brands, almost half of our country category combinations are growing volume double digits, which is up from about a 30, a year ago., Coke Energy,\\nInnovation Pipeline, Brand Extension, White Spaces, Volume Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, While we often talk about innovating in products, our evolution is just as much about changing how we work. Our organizational needs are ever-changing, as our portfolio and competitive environment become more complex around the world, so we\\'re adapting., Innovation,\\nWork, Organizational Needs, Portfolio, Competitive Environment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, One example is the creation of a new operating group, Global Ventures. The goal is to accelerate some of our businesses like Innocent and Costa Coffee that have the potential for growth across traditional borders. While the acquisition of Costa Coffee plays a significant entry point into hot beverages, it\\'s also more than that. Costa is a platform in coffee overall, this requires more and better connectivity than ever before., Global\\nVentures, Acceleration, Innocent, Costa Coffee, Connectivity, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, We spent the first three months, ensuring the transition from Whitbread went smoothly, while building connections within our existing businesses and Costa is performing in line with expectations., Transition,\\nConnection Building, Expectation, Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, As we look to the second quarter, we\\'ll be launching our first ready-to-drink Costa products, expect to have more about that in the weeks ahead., Costa\\nProducts, Launch, Second Quarter, Ready-To-Drink, Expectations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Turning now to our geographic performance. We saw good results in many markets around the world. Our emerging and developing markets are growing organic revenue double digits. And our developed markets are performing well, delivering mid single-digit organic revenue growth., Geographic\\nPerformance, Emerging Markets, Developing Markets, Organic Revenue Growth, Developed Markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, In EMEA, we grew organic revenue 14%, driven by continued growth in Europe and Turkey and improved performance in Russia., EMEA, Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Europe, Turkey, Russia, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, We also benefited from our European bottlers increasing their inventory levels as a safeguard to a potentially disruptive Brexit. Across Europe, revenue growth management initiatives and Zero Sugar innovations upgrading sustained momentum in the majority of our markets. Not only has this benefited price mix, but unit case volume was up 4% for our European sparkling soft drink portfolio. This performance was balanced with growth in tea and hydration categories as we broaden out the portfolio., Brexit,\\nInventory Levels, Revenue Growth Management, Zero Sugar, Portfolio Broadening, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Turning to North America, our results continue to march steady progress, driven by strong marketing and execution. Organic revenue was unfavorably impacted by 2 points for one less day in the quarter and the Easter shift and grew 1% driven by disciplined price pack management and solid value growth within sparking soft drinks, juice drinks and value-added dairy., Marketing,\\nExecution, Organic Revenue Growth, Price Pack Management, Value Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Our sparkling portfolio benefited from the continued strong performance in Coke Zero Sugar and new flavor innovations like orange, vanilla coke, which helped drive 6% retail value growth for brand Coca-Cola in our flagship markets., Coke Zero\\nSugar, New Flavor Innovations, Retail Value Growth, Brand Coca-Cola, Flagship Markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Unit case volume declined by 1% in North America as we continue to focus on providing consumers with smaller pack sizes. For example, mini cans grew 14% in the quarter, contributing to transactions outpacing volume, while driving significant value for our system and our customers., Unit Case\\nVolume, Focus on Smaller Pack Sizes, Mini Cans Growth, Transactions Outpacing Volume, Value for\\nSystem and Customers, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, In Latin America, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth in an increasingly difficult operating environment., Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Difficult Operating Environment, Latin America, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Argentina\\'s economic environment worsened, high inflation increased the salary gap and impacted private consumption. Volume here decline double digits. But we gained value and volume share by adjusting the price pack architecture to focus on transactions and maintaining our consumer base., Argentina\\'s\\nEconomic Environment, High Inflation, Salary Gap, Private Consumption, Price Pack Architecture, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, In Mexico, we are working with our bottling partners to ensure our revenue growth management initiatives continues to drive momentum. And Brazil, Brazil is on an upward trajectory. Our turnaround plan is working with volume up 5% and transactions up double digits in the quarter., Revenue Growth\\nManagement, Bottling Partners, Momentum, Turnaround Plan, Volume Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Incremental cooler placements and increased availability of our refillable packages are helping to drive this acceleration., Incremental\\nCooler Placements, Availability of Refillable Packages, Acceleration, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Finally, in Asia-Pacific, we saw good performance in China and India along with accelerating momentum in our Southeast Asia business unit, which drove 4% organic revenue growth for the segment overall. Execution around Chinese New Year was strong, contributing to 9% volume growth and double digit transaction growth in China., Asia-Pacific\\nPerformance, Good Performance in China and India, Accelerating Momentum in Southeast Asia, Execution\\naround Chinese New Year, Volume Growth and Transaction Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, In Japan, our system continues to deal with the supply chain impact from natural disasters last year. Manufacturing capacity remains tight, but is improving, with additional lines ramping up in the second quarter. So, we expect this to ease the capacity shortage, but full recovery will take until next year., Supply Chain\\nImpact, Natural Disasters, Manufacturing Capacity, Tight Supply, Full Recovery, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, In Japan, unit case volume was even. New product launches drove momentum in tea and coffee during the first quarter, while we cycle the benefit of a strong innovation pipeline in sparkling soft drinks last year., Tea and Coffee\\nMomentum, New Product Launches, Sparkling Soft Drinks, Unit Case Volume, Innovation Pipeline, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, So, in summary, we had a good start to the year. Our strategy of being more consumer focus and creating value for our customers is working, and we are confident we will deliver our full year targets and drive share on a value., Good Start to\\nthe Year, Consumer Focus, Creating Value for Customers, Full Year Targets, Share Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I\\'d like to cover three topics. One, our financial results in the quarter. Two, our outlook for the remainder of the year. And three, I\\'d like to say a few points on our currency hedging program., Financial\\nResults, Outlook for Remainder of Year, Currency Hedging Program, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, So starting with our financial performance in the quarter, as James said, we got off to a good start to the year. You\\'ll see that the composition of organic revenue growth in the first quarter was the inverse of what we saw last year, driven more by price mix than volume., Financial\\nPerformance, Good Start to the Year, Organic Revenue Growth, Price Mix, Volume, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Price mix was 5%, cycling 1% and trending ahead of our recent run rate, driven by strong price mix in North America, EMEA and Latin America, while concentrate shipments grew 1%, cycling 4% adversely impacted by one less day in the quarter., Price Mix,\\nConcentrate Shipments, North America, EMEA, Latin America, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Of course, with a portfolio as diverse as ours, there will often be variability in timing from quarter-to-quarter. The largest timing impact we saw was in Europe, where our bottlers increased safety stock in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit., Brexit, Safety\\nStock, Europe, Timing Impact, Diverse Portfolio, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This benefited both global price mix and concentrate shipments since Europe comprises high revenue for case markets. After normalizing for the estimated 2 points timing benefit and impact from one last day in the quarter, the best way to think of the underlying top line performance in the first quarter is 5%. Over the remainder of 2019, we expect a more balanced volume and price mix., Underlying Top\\nLine Performance, First Quarter, Normalizing Timing Benefit, Balanced Volume and Price Mix,\\nRemainder of 2019, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Importantly, I\\'m really encouraged by our organic performance in the first quarter and the sustainability of that growth going forward., Organic\\nPerformance, First Quarter, Sustainability, Growth Going Forward, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning now to margins for both gross and operating margins. We delivered another quarter of underlying margin expansion, in line with our expectations, our geographic groups were the primary driver, the function of continued innovation, revenue growth management strategies and the effective management of our cost structure. However, comparable margins contracted in the quarter due to the impact of acquisitions and currency., Margins,\\nUnderlying Margin Expansion, Geographic Groups, Innovation Strategies, Cost Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, At the gross profit level, we saw underlying gross margin expand about 30 basis points. Currencies and net acquisitions impacted gross margins by about 100 basis points and 80 basis points respectively. This was expected with the impact from net acquisitions, driven primarily by bottler transactions within our bottling investments segment., Gross Profit\\nMargin, Underlying Gross Margin Expansion, Currency Impact, Net Acquisitions Impact, Bottler\\nTransactions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, At the operating profit level, the continued focus on productivity as well as the timing of certain expenses drove a 240 basis point expansion in underlying operating margin. But this was offset by about 130 basis point impact from currencies and about 130 basis point impact from net acquisitions., Underlying\\nOperating Margin, Productivity Focus, Timing of Expenses, Currency Impact, Net Acquisitions Impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As James noted, comparable EPS growth -- grew 2% in the quarter, which was comprised of 13% comparable currency neutral growth, partially offset by an 11% currency headwind., Comparable EPS\\nGrowth, Currency Neutral Growth, Currency Headwind, EPS Growth Rate, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finally, we generated free cash flow of $335 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Strong underlying cash generation was offset by the impact of currency headwinds along with an increase in capital expenditures and cash tax payments., Free Cash\\nFlow, Underlying Cash Generation, Currency Headwinds, Capital Expenditures, Cash Tax Payments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Looking now at the remainder of the year, we are confident we can deliver the full year guidance we have spoke about previously and is included in our release. We do expect the quarterly phasing to be a bit uneven. So let me just highlight some considerations to factor into your models., Remainder of\\nYear, Full Year Guidance, Quarterly Phasing, Modeling Considerations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The timing benefit we received from bottlers stocking up in anticipation of Brexit was roughly $0.02 into the first quarter EPS, as we move forward we expect this to reverse this year. This is a fluid situation, but our current estimate is that our bottlers withhold their safety stock through the second and third quarter. So for modeling purposes, I would take the $0.02 out of the fourth quarter., Bottler Safety\\nStock, Brexit Timing Benefit, EPS Impact, Modeling Considerations, Second and Third Quarter, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Before giving a currency outlook, I\\'d like to highlight a few points. Since CAGNY, we\\'ve taken a close look at how we manage foreign exchange in over 70 functional currencies. For developed market currencies, I believe we have the right hedging strategy to mitigate fluctuations to cash flows. This approach has provided a significant cash flow benefit over the past five years, which is important for our Company given our large domestic cash obligations including the dividend., Currency\\nOutlook, Foreign Exchange Management, Cash Flow Benefit, Hedging Strategy, Domestic Cash\\nObligations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our challenge is emerging market currencies, given the increasing importance of emerging markets to our earnings base, while we have not underperformed versus other approaches, there has been a limited amount we can do to hedge this exposure in a cost efficient manner., Emerging\\nMarket Currencies, Hedge Exposure, Cost Efficiency, Limited Ability, Earning Base, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our approach to optimally manage this area and we\\'ll provide insights, if and when that approach evolves., Going Forward,\\nEvaluation Approach, Optimization, Insights, Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ve also looked at how to do a better job on overall communications. So, going forward, in quarters, where it is significant, we will begin calling out hedging as a component of the overall currency impact. So it\\'s clear what gains or losses we\\'ll be cycling next year., Communication,\\nQuarters, Hedging Component, Overall Currency Impact, Next Year, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For example, in the first quarter of 2019, the currency impact to operating income was not materially affected by hedging activities and it\\'s primarily the result of a change in spot rates., Currency, Operating Income, Hedging Activities, Spot Rates, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We will also provide preliminary currency outlook for the following year once we have better insight into our hedging activity for the latter year. I expect this to be on the third quarter earnings call., Currency,\\nOutlook, Hedging Activity, Earnings Call, Insight, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Returning to our near-term outlook. In the second quarter, we expect a 7 point currency impact to operating income. This includes a 2 point impact from hedging activity, driven almost entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year. We are hedged through options near current market rates for the G10 currencies as well as for certain emerging market currencies. So we have downside protection in the quarter and some upside opportunity should the dollar weaken., Currency, Operating Income, Hedging Activity, Outlook, Protection, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As we move into the back half of the year, we expect the impact from currencies to become less of a headwind each quarter. However, while we are hedged on the hard currencies through the end of 2019, we do have some exposure to fluctuations in emerging market currencies and our currency outlook would reflect this accordingly., Currency,\\nExposure, Outlook, Hedged, Emerging Market Currencies, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2019, 1, John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to answer any questions as you build out your models for the year. So in summary, organic revenue growth is strong and it\\'s broad-based. Currency and acquisitions impacted margins in the quarter, but pricing and productivity are driving underlying margin expansion, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our full year guidance. Operator, we are now ready for questions., Currency,\\nAcquisitions, Pricing, Margin Expansion, Guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2018. We concluded another quarter of solid operating performance, capping off a successful year. The non-alcoholic beverage industry was stronger in 2018 as emerging and developing markets accelerated from the prior year, while the developed world held its volume trajectory on top of stronger pricing., Industry,\\nMarkets, Pricing, Performance, Volume, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Our business performed well across all key dimensions in 2018 as we leveraged our transformation as a total beverage company. Most notably, we gained global value share, and those share gains were broad-based. We held or grew value share across each of our geographic segments. Organic revenue grew 5% versus our goal of 4%, driven by strengths across all operating segments., Performance,\\nShare Gains, Geographic Segments, Revenue Growth, Transformation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Underlying operating income grew 11% versus our goal of 8% to 9% as we built momentum through the year while accelerating the capture of productivity savings. This resulted in an approximate 170 basis point expansion in the underlying operating margin. And comparable EPS grew 9%, in line with our guidance of 8% to 10%, despite absorbing $600 million in stronger currency and structural headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. Our results reflect actions taken over the past several years to transform our business for long-term success., Momentum,\\nProductivity, Margin Expansion, Currency, EPS, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Execution is getting better. We set ourselves up for the future with an energized bottling system that is bringing a renewed focus on execution around the world and, in particular, several key markets, including North America, where we have completed our refranchising activities. Pricing power is improving. We are delivering accelerated top-line growth as we continue to implement revenue growth management initiatives in markets around the world., Execution,\\nFocus, Pricing Power, Growth, Revenue Management, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, And marketing is becoming sharper. We\\'re focusing on innovation that leverages brand edge and ritual building, with increased efforts to digitally connect with consumers. And we have begun embedding a productivity mindset across the organization. Now let\\'s talk specifically about how we drove disciplined growth this past year., Innovation,\\nBrand Edge, Ritual Building, Productivity, Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, First, we strengthened our sparkling soft drink portfolio, leveraging brand edge and innovation to build consumption rituals by offering people what they want, when and where they want it. Trademark Coke grew volume 2%, driven by solid performance in brand Coke and supported by innovation such as Coca-Cola Plus Coffee and Coke origins as well as strong growth in our No Sugar variance. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar delivered yet another year of double-digit volume growth globally. And in North America, we reinvigorated Diet Coke with the brand growing retail value 3% after multiple years of declines., Brand Edge,\\nInnovation, Volume Growth, Trademark Coke, Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Trademark Sprite also performed well, growing global volume 2% through premium innovation such as Sprite plus fiber in China. Second, we rapidly scaled successful brands like Fuze Tea, smartwater and AdeS across more markets. With the launch of Fuze Tea in Europe, we delivered over 100 million incremental cases in EMEA, offsetting the volume loss from the dissolution of Beverage Partners Worldwide. This enabled us to gain leadership positions within the ready-to-drink tea category across 11 European markets, highlighting what an aligned system can accomplish., Trademark\\nCoke, Trademark Sprite, Premium Innovation, Brand Scale, Volume Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Of course, driving disciplined growth isn\\'t just about expanding our beverage portfolio. We need to allocate resources to those brands and strategic initiatives that are delivering the highest returns. To that end, we eliminated over 700 underperforming zombie SKUs. By finding ways like this to reduce complexity, we ensure that our system sales force is focused, our supply chain is efficient and our latest innovations get more space and visibility at the point of sale., Disciplined\\nGrowth, Resource Allocation, Portfolio Expansion, Complexity Reduction, Sales Force Focus, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Third, we expanded our portfolio through M&A and strategic investments. This included smaller investments like BODYARMOR, one of the fastest-growing beverage trademarks in the U.S. Of course, our biggest announcement was the acquisition of Costa, which we closed on January 3 this year. Costa platform will give us the ability to scale within the $500 billion global hot beverage category and create a world-class global coffee business, allowing us to better serve our customers and strengthen our ready-to-drink portfolio., Portfolio\\nExpansion, M&A, Strategic Investments, Costa Acquisition, Hot Beverage Category, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, All of this shows how we\\'ve been pursuing the vision we first shared with you a couple of years ago. Now one of the most important enablers of this work is having the right leadership team and operating structure in place. In 2018, we appointed our president and chief operating officer to bring accelerated focus on execution and talent development. We announced an orderly transition for the CFO with Kathy\\'s retirement and John\\'s shift from operations to finance., Leadership\\nTeam, Operating Structure, Talent Development, Financial Leadership, Transition, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, We added two new group presidents with considerable experience. And we created a new group, Global Ventures, to ensure we connect and globally scale key acquisitions, investments and partnerships like Costa Coffee, Innocent and Monster. The changes we\\'ve made are significant, and they help set us up for more success in the years to come across our geographies. Looking around the world., New\\nLeadership, Global Ventures, Acquisitions, Investments, Geographies, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, We are already delivering better performance in key markets. In EMEA, we grew organic revenue 7%, delivering a second sequential year of accelerated top-line growth. We accomplished this in part due to revenue growth management initiatives that focus on small baskets and pack sizes. These were phased in to multiple markets over the year., Revenue\\nGrowth, Key Markets, EMEA, Initiatives, Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, As we continue to build on these actions in 2019, we expect continued good performance. In Asia Pacific, good results across several large emerging markets drove our strongest organic revenue growth in over five years. We had a stronger innovation pipeline, solid digital initiatives and steadily improving execution by our bottling partners. For example, in India, 25% of our revenue growth came from new products., Asia Pacific,\\nEmerging Markets, Innovation Pipeline, Digital Initiatives, Execution, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, And in China, digital initiatives, coupled with a robust innovation pipeline, resulted in solid performance. During the fourth quarter, our B2C business capitalized on Singles Day, the massive online shopping holiday. Both our digital B2C and B2B businesses grew over 40% for the year and now account for over 5% of the system revenues in the market. And collectively, across the group, our bottling system opened approximately one million new customer outlets., Digital\\nInitiatives, Innovation Pipeline, Performance in China, Singles Day, Bottling System, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Turning to Latin America. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth for the year as we continued to execute against the fundamentals amid varying macro environments. In Argentina, the economy tipped into recession in the back half of 2018, so we adjusted quickly our plan to maintain affordability and protect our consumer base. In Mexico, our business continued to perform well amid a volatile backdrop., Latin America,\\nOrganic Revenue Growth, Execution, Macro Environments, Argentina, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, And in Brazil, the operating environment became more certain after the elections. The turnaround of our business there is taking hold, and our strategies are driving improved performance. Finally, in North America, we continued to deliver strong performance in the marketplace and gain value share, supported by a stronger, fully refranchised bottling system. During the year, we undertook a significant package resizing initiative across our chilled juice and tea portfolios and implemented pricing actions across our sparkling soft drink portfolio to manage through a challenging cost environment while adding over $1 billion in incremental retail value to our customers for the brands the Coke system sales., Brazil, North\\nAmerica, Turnaround, Initiatives, Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Due to the strength of our brands and increased investments from our independent bottling partners we were able to capture price/mix in the marketplace while beating historical elasticity. So lots of activity across our various regions. Overall, there is a consistent thread in what\\'s driving better results across our territories. We\\'ve strengthened our brands, including Coca-Cola, through strategic innovation and more disciplined ritual building., Strength of\\nBrands, Investments, Price/Mix, Activity Across Regions, Strategic Innovation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, And our bottling partners have increased investments and improved execution. And together, we\\'re aligned as a system on how to capture the growth opportunities before us. Before moving on to 2019, let me provide some context on the fourth quarter. We continued to grow global organic revenues 5%., Investments,\\nExecution, Growth Opportunities, Organic Revenue Growth, Fourth Quarter, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, The composition of the growth changed. We delivered stronger sequential price/mix, while unit case volume was flat. Volume was impacted by slowing economic conditions in some countries like Argentina, plus decisions to focus on value over volume in certain markets. However, we\\'ve seen a good start to 2019 with more balanced volume and price/mix, and this is consistent with our expectation for the full year., Growth,\\nPrice/Mix, Volume, Economic Conditions, Markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing the impact of some increasing uncertainty and volatility in global macroeconomic conditions. Consumers are under more pressure as we head into the new year. However, demand for our categories remain healthy, and our business is built to perform even if the tailwinds behind us moderate somewhat. Ultimately, we\\'ll focus on what we can control, taking steps to manage the business as we become a total beverage company: further lifting, shifting and scaling on-trend brands like Fuze Tea, smartwater and Innocent across markets; reformulating products to reduce sugar levels; rolling out revenue growth initiatives across additional territories to improve performance within our sparkling soft drink portfolio; connecting Costa across many of our business units to build a leading global coffee business; and leveraging digitization to build a business for the future., Uncertainty,\\nVolatility, Macroeconomic Conditions, Demand, Business Strategy, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Therefore, we feel confident that we can deliver against our 2019 guidance. Finally, I\\'d like to thank Kathy. Kathy has made significant contributions to our company, our system and our people, working her way from financial analyst all the way to the most senior financial role in the company, truly a testament to the value she has brought through every phase of her journey. As CFO, she has stewarded the company\\'s financials through an extremely complex refranchising process, and she is leaving a strong foundation for John to build upon., Confidence,\\nGuidance, Kathy\\'s Contributions, Financial Stewardship, Refranchising Process, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Finally, she has been a critical partner to me, and I have appreciated all of her valuable support. With that, let me turn it over to Kathy., Kathy\\'s\\nContributions, Support, Turnover to Kathy, Financial Stewardship, Appreciation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. During my time as CFO, I\\'ve met personally with many people who are on the call this morning, from analysts who follow our industry to investors in our company, to many of our associates and partners that I know are listening this morning. I thank each and every one of you and many others for your help, whether it was in the form of guidance, support, prodding or challenging. Each encounter helped me to be a better CFO and a better representative of this company that I love., Personal\\nEncounters, Listeners, Support, Guidance, Love, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Effective March 15, I retire after 30-plus years with The Coca-Cola Company. From the very beginning, with my start in accounting research, I have had amazing opportunities to learn and grow and, eventually, become a leader in the company. I am very proud to have been a part of this company and this system. Coca-Cola is about experiences and making lives better for everyone who touches our system, from the smallest shop or kiosk owner to the largest customer to those who simply enjoy drinking our products., Retirement,\\nCareer Growth, Opportunities, Pride, Company Culture, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, It has been my privilege to be a part of this extraordinary business, and it will be my pleasure to watch Coca-Cola continue to grow and evolve under the leadership of James, Brian and John and the rest of the leadership team, along with the hard work and support of the 700,000 people who are taking the system into the future. And with that, I will hand this call over to the future and let John take it from here., Privilege,\\nPleasure, Leadership Team, Hard Work, Support, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Kathy. You have been a great partner over the years, and you leave behind a tremendous legacy. My congratulations to you on your retirement, and my appreciation as well for your many contributions over the years to the company and especially to many people in the company. Now I look forward to partnering with James and Brian to drive the business going forward., Kathy\\'s\\nLegacy, Retirement, Contributions, Partnership, Appreciation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, And before I begin, let me just take a moment to talk about my key priorities going into this role. Number one will be to drive healthy top-line growth, leveraging our expanding portfolio. Number two will be to improve margins in all our operating segments. Number three will be to optimize our balance sheet and allocate capital in a disciplined manner to our highest-return activities., Drive Growth,\\nImprove Margins, Optimize Balance Sheet, Disciplined Capital Allocation, Key Priorities, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Number four will be to drive a culture of agility and productivity across the enterprise. And number five will be to develop our people and build the capabilities that we need as a company going forward. Ultimately, I will be looking to push our enterprise to find opportunities to sustainably maximize free cash flow and returns. Turning to our financial performance., Drive Culture,\\nDevelop People, Sustainable Growth, Financial Performance, Free Cash Flow, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, As James said, 2018 was a good year. We delivered 9% comparable EPS growth due to momentum in the underlying business, accelerated productivity and a favorable tax rate. Our press release covered our fourth-quarter results in detail, so I will focus on our 2019 guidance. At a high level, we expect 4% organic revenue growth, double-digit comparable currency-neutral operating income growth, comparable EPS to range from plus 1% to minus 1% and free cash flow of at least $6 billion., 2018\\nPerformance, 2019 Guidance, Organic Growth, Operating Income Growth, Free Cash Flow, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Now let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. We expect global growth to be slightly lower than in 2018, with continued growth in the developed world and macroeconomic challenges in certain emerging markets. However, there is a significant amount of uncertainty and geopolitical tension, which could result in further changes in this macro environment. That said, we focus on the things we can control, and the actions we\\'ve taken over the past few years have set us up for continued success despite shifting macros., Global Growth,\\nMacroeconomic Challenges, Uncertainty, Geopolitical Tension, Actions Taken, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, We expect organic revenue growth to benefit from our continued focus on lifting, shifting and scaling products, such as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Fuze Tea, as well as implementing revenue growth management activities across more markets. In addition to solid organic growth, we expect an eight to nine-point benefit to revenue from net M&A and structural activity. We completed our North American franchising efforts and divested our company-owned bottlers in Uruguay and Guatemala last year. We also took full ownership of our Philippines bottler in the fourth quarter., Organic\\nGrowth, Lifting and Shifting Products, Revenue Growth Management, M&A and Structural Activity,\\nFranchising Efforts, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, And earlier this year, we closed the acquisitions of both Costa Coffee and the remaining stake in Chi, Africa\\'s leading value-added dairy and juice company. We expect the net effect of these transactions to result in lower comparable gross margins for the year, driven by the Philippines bottling operations. In the U.S., while freight costs are expected to remain above historical levels, we do not expect to see the same level of year-over-year increases we saw last year. And we have $600 million remaining in growth productivity to capture in 2019., Costa Coffee\\nAcquisition, Chi Acquisition, Gross Margins, Freight Costs, Growth Productivity, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, A portion of these savings will be reinvested in the business. Recent investments are generating a good return, as evidenced by our strong top line relative to most CPG peers. So all-in, we expect solid pricing, a continued focus on expense management and a net benefit from acquisitions to deliver 10% to 11% comparable currency-neutral operating income growth. We expect currency to be a 6% to 7% headwind to operating income as we face a strengthened dollar and cycle hedging gains in 2018., Pricing,\\nExpense Management, Acquisitions, Currency Headwind, Operating Income Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Below the line, we expect deleverage, driven by higher net interest expense. And we expect an effective tax rate of 19.5%. However, this rate could vary from quarter to quarter. So in summary, we expect double-digit comparable currency-neutral operating income growth, but the impact of currency, along with higher income and taxes, will lead to the stated range of plus 1% to minus 1% for comparable EPS growth in 2019., Deleverage,\\nNet Interest Expense, Effective Tax Rate, Comparable EPS Growth, Currency Impact, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, As you model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of phasing. The first quarter will have one less day than in 2018. Easter will fall in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year. Due to the timing of Fed rate increases, the year-over-year increase in interest expense will be more heavily skewed to the first half of 2019 than the back half., Phasing,\\nEaster Timing, Interest Expense Skew, First Half vs Back Half, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, And similarly, because of when the dollar strengthened last year, we expect a more significant currency headwind in early 2019, which will then begin to moderate as we move through the year. As James said, we created a new operating group, Global Ventures. This will be a new reporting segment in 2019 and will include Costa Coffee, Dogadan Tea, Innocent and Monster. As such, we will provide the revised operating segment financial information reflecting this change before first-quarter results are released., Currency\\nHeadwind, Global Ventures, Costa Coffee, Dogadan Tea, Innocent and Monster, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, I realize that at times our company can be complex to model. For example, our M&A and structural changes impact several of our operating segments this year. Our Investor Relations team will host a call at 10:30 this morning to answer any further questions as you build out your models for the year. So in summary, we delivered against our EPS guidance in 2018 amid stronger headwinds than anticipated at the beginning of the year., M&A Impact,\\nStructural Changes, Investor Relations Call, EPS Guidance, Headwinds, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 4, John Murphy, Incoming Chief Financial Officer, We maintain a disciplined approach to our use of capital, and we are well-positioned to capture growth opportunities as we enter 2019. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\\xa0, Disciplined\\nCapital Use, Growth Opportunities, Readiness for Questions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning everyone. We\\'ve had another solid quarter that has included a number of notable developments from M&A to changes in our leadership team, and I\\'ll come to all of that shortly. But let me start by focusing on our quarter and our year-to-date performance., M&A,\\nLeadership Team, Quarterly Performance, Year-to-Date Performance, Notable Developments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, We are gaining share in a growing industry. Industry growth has improved from last year, driven by better results across both developed and emerging markets. Some large emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil are clearly doing better. Others like Argentina, South Africa and the Middle East are not doing so well, but collectively we are seeing solid results., Industry\\nGrowth, Emerging Markets, Developed Markets, Share Gain, Market Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve been capturing more than our fair share of growth as we continue to execute on ad transformation as a total beverage company. And notably, the industry has seen better performance within the global sparkling soft drink category, delivering both volume and value growth year-to-date., Ad\\nTransformation, Total Beverage Company, Industry Performance, Sparkling Soft Drink Category, Growth\\nCapture, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Turning to our operational performance. We are managing our business well across key dimensions. Organic revenue is up 5% year-to-date, driven by strength across all operating segments. Unit case volume is up 2% led by Trademark Coca-Cola, which grew 3% globally. Comparable EPS is up 8% year-to-date in line with our guidance of 8% to 10% for the full year. This is despite significantly stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of 2018. We accomplished this through a combination of top line growth and productivity initiatives as driving underlying margin expansion, even as we continue to invest back in the marketing and face a rising cost environment. Finally, our top and bottom line growth is broad-based. Developed markets have grown organic revenues low single digit year-to-date and our emerging and developing markets have grown double digits year-to-date., Operational\\nPerformance, Key Dimensions, Organic Revenue, Unit Case Volume, Comparable EPS, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Turning to our geographic performance in the quarter. In EMEA, we grew organic revenue 9%, benefiting from solid operational price mix as well as from geographic mix. During the quarter, we saw strong growth across Europe driven by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fuze Tea and innocent, all helped by good weather. In some of the emerging and developing markets like Turkey and the Middle East, the macroeconomic environment is tough, but ongoing packaging and pricing initiatives are helping us deliver solid revenue growth while staying affordable., Geographic\\nPerformance, Organic Revenue Growth, EMEA, Europe, Emerging and Developing Markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Turning to Asia Pacific, despite cycling a more difficult comparison period, strong performance in China and India drove another quarter of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment. In Japan, a solid innovation pipeline was overshadowed by natural disasters in July and September, which included a flood that destroyed a production facility for our bottler, impacting our capacity. Looking ahead, we will continue working closely with our bottlers to minimize the impact and protect our position in the market., Asia Pacific,\\nOrganic Revenue Growth, China, India, Japan, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, In Latin America, we delivered 19% organic revenue growth for the quarter as we continued to execute against the fundamentals amid a variety of macroeconomic environments. Now worth noting, nine points of that growth is due to the timing of concentrate shipments in Brazil, which will reverse out in the fourth quarter. However, even after adjusting for this timing element, we still delivered double-digit top line growth in the quarter., Latin America,\\nOrganic Revenue Growth, Macroeconomic Environments, Brazil, Double-Digit Top Line Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, In Brazil, our business continued its recovery with volume growth accelerating to 3% in the quarter, driven by positive performance in all category clusters. Argentina on the other hand, faces increasingly challenging macro conditions. So we are focusing on expanding our returnable packaging infrastructure, adjusting our price pack architecture to maintain key price points and affordability, it\\'s a playbook we understand, even one I personally managed before. Mexico, Mexico continues to perform well benefiting from new product launches and strong growth in Trademark Coca-Cola supported by solid execution from our bottling system., Brazil,\\nArgentina, Mexico, Category Clusters, Macro Conditions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Finally, North America. We continue to deliver strong performance in the marketplace and gain value share. During the quarter, our system took a price increase to address pressure from higher input and transportation costs. As a result, our price mix improved 3 points sequentially resulting in a slight positive price mix for the first quarter this year, and we continue to deliver strong performance especially within the Zero Sugar portfolio. This in turn led to accelerated organic revenue growth of 2% and comparable operating income growth of 5% in the third quarter., North America,\\nPrice Increase, Price Mix, Organic Revenue Growth, Comparable Operating Income Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Now let\\'s talk a bit about how we are driving disciplined growth in the business. Of course, it all starts with the consumer. Over the last few calls, we\\'ve discussed how we\\'ve been leveraging innovations like coke with coffee to grow our portfolio by addressing key consumption occasions, and also how we are lifting, shifting and scaling successful brands like Fuze Tea across multiple markets. However, there are times when we need or want to look externally and leverage M&A to drive our total beverage portfolio. M&A, of course is not a strategy in of itself, it\\'s an enabler of our strategy, and while the focus of M&A continuously evolves, what\\'s consistent is, we remain disciplined about our allocation of capital and about the mission of M&A as an enabler., Driving\\nGrowth, Consumer, Innovations, Portfolio Expansion, M&A Strategy, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Over the last few months, we\\'ve announced quite a few acquisitions and investments. Each one is part of our larger strategy to broaden our consumer centric portfolio but don\\'t read too much into the number of transactions in a single quarter and extrapolate that as the pace of activity going forward. We, of course, use M&A for many purposes to fill gaps in our portfolio, yes enter emerging categories or even obtained capabilities of platforms that complement our existing strengths, and we look for opportunities to create value by scaling brands to be bigger and better than they already are., M&A Strategy,\\nConsumer-Centric Portfolio, Emerging Categories, Brand Scaling, Value Creation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, In North America, we invested in BODYARMOR, a premium sports performance and hydration brand. It\\'s one of the fastest growing beverage trademarks in the United States. In Australia, we purchased Organic & Raw Trading Company, which gives us MOJO, our first company-owned kombucha brand and we invested in the Maid group which is known for products like cold-pressed juice and high protein smoothies., Investments,\\nNorth America, BODYARMOR, Australia, MOJO, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, In Europe, we purchased Tropico which gives our French business a strong foothold in the Still fruit-flavored beverages. We believe these brands that have strong edge will eventually allow us to gain quality leadership in the respective categories. And of course, our biggest announcement for the quarter was our pending acquisition of Costa. What we get with Costa is more than just a brand, it\\'s a platform that will give us the ability to scale within the $500 billion global hot beverage category. Despite the size of Costa, our approach will be similar to the other deals like innocent and Honest. We will aim to preserve Costa\\'s unique capabilities while adding the strength of the Coca-Cola system., Europe, Still\\nFruit-Flavored Beverages, Quality Leadership, Acquisition, Costa Platform, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, As with all our M&A, completing the acquisition is only the first step. What is critical is accelerating our results and executing with precision. To ensure we properly connect and globally scale key acquisitions, investments and partnerships, we have created a new group Global Ventures to be led by Jennifer Mann. In this newly created position, Jennifer and her team will focus on ensuring we get the maximum value from acquisitions and investments like Costa, our partnership with the Monster Beverage, et cetera. This Group will also partner with colleagues around the world to identify and nurture the next series of fast-growing opportunities., Global\\nVentures, Acquisition Execution, Partnerships, Costa, Monster Beverage, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, As you\\'ll recall, this was one of just, one of the -- just on the organizational changes we announced in mid-October. Now more than ever, we must constantly adapt our business to the changing marketplace. The leadership changes we are making over the coming months are significant and I believe that they will set us up for success in the years to come., Leadership\\nChanges, Organizational Changes, Market Adaptation, Success, Coming Months, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Beginning January 1, Brian Smith will become will become our President and Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Brian will bring an accelerated focus on the execution of our initiatives in the field while I\\'ll focus on the overall success of the company as well as our long-term strategic direction. Brian is a valued business partner with tremendous experience, most recently as Group President for Europe, Middle East and Africa. At a time when our business is fast changing and more complex than ever, it\\'s important to have a skilled executive who can focus intently on the success of our field operations. I can\\'t think of a better fit than Brian., Brian Smith,\\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, Field Execution, Long-term Strategic Direction, Business\\nPartner, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve also announced the succession plan for our Chief Finance Officer. Kathy, who had a tremendous 32-year career of the company will retire as CFO in March of next year. She will be succeeded as CFO by John Murphy, who will begin the transition to his new job of serving as deputy CFO starting January 1. John currently leads our Asia Pacific Group and it\\'s a great choice for the vital work of overseeing our finance organization. John\\'s extensive experience includes financial, strategy and operational roles, so he is a natural fit to step in., Kathy,\\nRetirement, John Murphy, Succession Plan, Deputy CFO, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, And finally, we elected Nancy Quan as Chief Technical Officer. Nancy will join my leadership team to focus on product supply, strategic sourcing and technical governance as we evolve as a total beverage company. These changes led to a number of others that we also announced and I\\'m pleased that our deep bench allows us to to move our group of diverse talented and experienced leaders into new roles quickly., Nancy Quan,\\nChief Technical Officer, Product Supply, Strategic Sourcing, Technical Governance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, So in summary, the global economy is still growing but remains volatile. Some markets are getting better, where there are -- while others are struggling as the economic cycle moves to different phase. Our industry is growing, driven by both developed and emerging markets and we are winning with momentum in our business. So despite currency moving against us, we remain focused on delivering the earnings guidance, we laid out at the beginning of the year., Global\\nEconomy, Volatility, Market Performance, Currency Movement, Earnings Guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Finally, I\\'d like to thank Kathy. While Kathy will be with us through next March, I would be remiss not to take a moment to thank her and acknowledge her outstanding career. Over her 32 years here at the company, Kathy has made significant contributions to both our company and the system, working away from financial analysts, all the way to the most senior finance roles in the company, truly a testament to the value she has brought through every phase of the journey. And as CFO for the past five years, she executed the company\\'s financials through the extremely complex refranchising process and she\\'s leaving a strong foundation for John to build on. And finally, she has been a critical partner to me and I\\'ve appreciated all her valuable support. Thank you, Kathy., Career,\\nContributions, Financials, Leadership, Partnership, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, James and good morning everyone. It has been a tremendous honor to serve as the Chief Financial Officer of the Coca-Cola Company. During my tenure with the company, I\\'ve seen our business evolving growth from a sparkling beverage company with three principal brands to a total beverage company with numerous billion-dollar brands that span across all beverage categories. It is also been a pleasure working for first Muhtar and now James. I\\'m excited for the future of the company. We have a great leadership team that will continue to build on and execute the company\\'s strategy, and I\\'m particularly excited about the incoming CFO, John Murphy. John\\'s experience and capabilities will allow him to be a great partner to James and a great leader for the finance organization. So I\\'m looking forward to working with my team as we close out the rest of 2018 and I look forward to working with John to ensure a smooth transition as he takes over in 2019., Tenure,\\nEvolution, Leadership, Transition, Excitement, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, So now, turning to our performance in the quarter. As James mentioned, we saw a strong underlying growth, building on a solid first half. We delivered 6% organic revenue growth, driven by 4% concentrate shipments and 2% price mix. Concentrate shipments outpaced unit case volume growth by 2 points in the quarter. This is due largely to Brazilian bottlers building inventory as a precaution to any further supply disruptions in the country around the Presidential Elections and ahead of changes in local tax regulation. We anticipate this inventory build will reverse in the fourth quarter as elections are now completed and the tax regulation has been phased in., Growth,\\nRevenue, Shipments, Inventory, Tax Regulation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, The strong organic revenue growth combined with ongoing productivity measures and the timing of expenses drove 20% underlying operating income growth in the quarter. While the underlying results are strong as you know, our reported financials continue to be affected by accounting changes enacted at the beginning of this year and from cycling bottler refranchising activity from last year. Our comparable operating margin increased 575 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an approximate 130 basis point impact from new accounting standard and currencies., Growth,\\nOperating Income, Margin, Accounting Changes, Currencies, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Productivity helped drive the roughly 400 basis point expansion in underlying operating margin with actions across all of our operating segments. However we saw a particular benefit in our North America and corporate segments due to lean enterprise initiative. The accounting impact and the change in revenue recognition was roughly in line with our expectations. It\\'s important to note that the impact varied significantly by operating segment. For example, Latin America saw over a 400 basis point benefit in its margin while North American\\'s margin was impacted by roughly 250 basis points. So I recognize that there are lot of moving parts, but if you would realize each of these effects, our underlying operating margins expanded about 400 basis points in the quarter and about 200 basis points for the year-to-date period., Productivity, Operating Margin, Accounting Impact, Revenue Recognition, Segments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Below the line, we benefited from a lower tax rate. In order to bring our year-to-date effective tax rate in line with our revised full-year expectation of 20.3%, we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the quarter. So all in, good operational performance coupled with a timing benefit and a lower effective tax rate resulted in comparable EPS of $0.58 in the quarter, up 14%, which includes an 8% unfavorable impact from currencies., Tax\\nRate, EPS, Operational Performance, Currencies, Timing Benefit, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, So before turning to the fourth quarter, let me provide an update on bottler transactions. I\\'m happy to announce that with the sale of our company-owned bottler in Canada at the end of the third quarter, we have now completed our North America bottler refranchising process. We set ourselves up for the future with an energized bottling system that is bringing a renewed focus on their local market. In Asia, we expect to acquire 51% of our Philippines bottler for Coca-Cola FEMSA during the fourth quarter. This will become a part of our bottling Investment Group, which is now comprised primarily of South West and Southeast Asian bottler., Bottler\\nTransactions, Refranchising, Canada, Asia, Philippines, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, These two transactions should roughly offset each other resulting in a minimal structural impact in our P&L in 2019. In Africa, we are moving forward with the sale process for our company-owned bottler but we now expect to sell an equity stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in 2019 rather than in the fourth quarter of 2018., Africa, Sale\\nProcess, Equity Stake, Structural Impact, P&L, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Now turning to the remainder of this year, considering our performance year-to-date and despite an increasingly challenging currency environment, we are maintaining our guidance on organic revenue and comparable EPS growth. Specifically, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of at least 4% and comparable EPS growth of 8% to 10%. However, there are two elements within the guidance that are changing and then as a third element that impacts phasing. While these balance together for the full year, due to the timing of each, they do result in a shift between quarters., Growth,\\nCurrency Environment, Guidance, Quarterly Shift, Timing, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, So first, we expect the third quarter inventory build up in our Brazilian bottlers to reverse in the fourth quarter. Second, we now expect the sell CCBA, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in 2019 better than 2018. As such, a twopenny structural benefit that we expected to receive from this transaction will now shift on the fourth quarter \\'18 into our our 2019 earnings., Inventory\\nBuild-Up, Brazil, Sell CCBA, Structural Benefit, Earnings, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Third, we now expect an effective tax rate of 20.3% for the full year versus our original estimate of 21%. Now this will be a slight benefit to our fourth quarter earnings, it was a much larger benefit to our third quarter earnings. And this is because we needed to bring our year-to-date effective tax rate in line with our revised full-year expectation. So as such we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the third quarter. And taken together, these retained is representing $0.03 unfavorable impact to fourth-quarter earnings but the full year does not change. As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each element in more detail as you build out your models for the year., Tax Rate,\\nEarnings, Full Year, Quarterly Shift, Investor Relations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 3, Kathy Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to cash flow, we continue to expect to generate cash from operations of approximately $8 billion and we remain disciplined in our capital allocation. We continue to expect to reinvest $1.7 billion in the business through capital expenditures and we will return free cash flow to shareowners through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and an expected $1 billion in net share repurchase. So in summary, we delivered solid financial performance in both the quarter and year-to-date period. And we remain focused on delivering full-year comparable EPS within our previously provided range of 8% to 10%. So, operator, we\\'re now ready for questions., Cash Flow,\\nOperations, Capital Allocation, Dividends, Share Repurchase, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying and underlining that we\\'re winning in a dynamic and vibrant industry. The global beverage industry is growing faster than last year, driven by better results in the emerging and developing markets, and also the sparkling soft drink category. We\\'re gaining value share as we execute on the strategies we laid out for you in early 2017, and importantly, our operating performance is accelerating as a result., Growth,\\nIndustry, Execution, Value Share, Operating Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, So, 2018 -- at the halfway mark of the year, we\\'re seeing good momentum in our underlying business. Organic revenue is up 5% year to date, driven by a good mixture of volume and price mix, global volume is up 3%, which is the strongest we\\'ve seen in five years, and comparable EPS is up 5% year to date despite stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of 2018, and, as we noted at the start of the year, we\\'ve always expected EPS growth to be back-half weighted, and that has not changed., Momentum,\\nBusiness, Volume, Currency Headwinds, EPS Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, So, operationally, looking around the world, we delivered strong top-line growth in the first half of the year, driven by continued strength in our international markets. In Asia-Pacific, strong performance in key emerging markets like China, India, and Vietnam drove mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment during the first half of the year. While we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio across all of our Asia markets, our sparkling soft drink portfolio led our top-line acceleration., Strong Growth,\\nInternational Markets, Asia-Pacific, Sparkling Soft Drink Portfolio, Total Beverage Portfolio, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to Latin America, even in the face of headwinds, we delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth for the first half as we focused on the fundamentals. Mexico continues to perform well, driven by solid growth across our sparkling and dairy portfolios. In Brazil, a ten-day transport strike in late May put a virtual halt to the economy. Prior to that, we were on track to deliver the third quarter of sequentially improving volume growth. Our system worked hard to recover momentum, and by the end of the quarter, we had bounced back to pre-strike growth rates., Latin America,\\nOrganic Revenue Growth, Mexico, Brazil, Transport Strike, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, In EMEA, we grew organic revenues 7% year to date through balanced volume and price mix. We see solid momentum in the emerging and developing markets with notable strength in central Europe and Turkey. And, in the developed markets, we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio through additions like Fuze Tea, Honest Coffee, and AdeZ plant-based beverages across Europe., EMEA, Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Emerging Markets, Central Europe, Turkey, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, In North America, we\\'re delivering strong performance in the marketplace year to date. According to Nielsen, our U.S. retail sales are up 3% in the second quarter, driven by both volume and pricing. We are pleased with the performance of our innovation and brand-building initiatives. Our no-sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio delivered 7% retail value growth in the quarter thanks to the recently restaged Diet Coke and strong growth of Coke Zero Sugar. Our hydration and coffee portfolios drove strong results as well. Powerade Zero, Dasani Sparkling, and our coffee portfolio each grew volume double digits. These efforts, combined with the improving execution from our bottling partners, have enabled our system to continue capturing strong value-share gains., Strong\\nPerformance, Marketplace, Innovation, Brand-Building, Value Share Gains, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now, let me turn to the pricing environment in North America. Stepping back, the overall market remains disciplined, and we remain focused on executing revenue growth management initiatives to grow our price mix over time. However, as you can see, reported price mix in North America continued to differ from market-level performance. This was principally due to three factors. First, freight costs remain a challenge, were slightly worse than our initial forecasts, and as we noted in the first-quarter call, outbound freight costs are reported in price mix for 2018. Secondly, the timing of deductions, which net out in the year, between the second quarter and the third quarter put a point of pressure on price mix. Lastly, business mix put two points of pressure on reported price mix as our concentrated sparkling business grew faster than our finished goods business, particularly the juice and tea., Pricing\\nEnvironment, Disciplined Market, Revenue Growth Management, Freight Costs, Business Mix, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Combined, these factors put approximately four points of pressure on the reported price mix, driving the vast majority of the difference you see versus the growth in scanner data. We\\'re taking pricing actions alongside our bottlers on our sparkling beverage brands and expect to see positive price mix in the second half across the portfolio in aggregate as our package downsizing and our marketplace pricing actions are fully implemented and the timing items reverse. These factors, along with the continued execution of our strategy, will result in stronger financial performance in North America in the back half. So, to summarize, our emerging and developing markets are accelerating with double-digit organic revenue growth year to date and our developed markets are performing well, delivering low single-digit organic revenue growth., Reported Price\\nMix, Scanner Data, Pricing Actions, Marketplace Pricing, Financial Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now, turning and talking a little bit about how we\\'re driving disciplined, sustainable growth in the business. Obviously, first, it requires a solid understanding of the consumer to build the right portfolio in each market. Over the last few calls, we\\'ve discussed how we\\'re expanding our portfolio through innovations, acquisitions, and lifting, shifting, and scaling successful brands across markets. But, disciplined growth also requires that our existing brands retain and sharpen their edge by connecting better with consumers\\' needs. We\\'re working diligently to increase our capabilities in this area because satisfying key consumption occasions allows us to attract new drinkers and ultimately achieve quality leadership., Consumer\\nUnderstanding, Portfolio Building, Disciplined Growth, Brand Edge, Capabilities, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, One example of this is Georgia Coffee in Japan. Georgia has historically had a strong male consumer base in Japan. So, we recently launched a new beverage called Craftsman with recipes, flavors, and packaging designed to appeal more to the new consumer segments, in particular, younger adults and women. Craftsman\\'s drinks come in premium, glass-like PET bottles that are resealable, making them portable and easier to consume. This is a change from the traditional cams, opening up new consumption occasions that were previously untapped. We\\'re off to a good start with our coffee portfolio in Japan, reversing recent trends and growing volume in the single digits., Georgia\\nCoffee, Japan, Consumer Segments, New Consumption Occasions, Coffee Portfolio, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, This kind of discipline, of taking a very tailored approach to consumption occasions and channels, is also one of the ways we\\'re attracting new sparkling drinkers. For our flagship brand, Coca-Cola, we\\'re leveraging the brand\\'s edge, which is centered around uplift and energize to build consumption rituals through consumers with strategic innovation. An example: Coca-Cola with coffee. This product started as a trial in Australia. Other markets are now introducing it, but with twists based on the learning., Discipline,\\nConsumption Occasions, Channels, Brand Edge, Innovation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, In Vietnam, for example, the brewed coffee category is very large. We introduced Coke Plus Coffee there with great coffee queues like aroma, less sugar, positioning it as an alternative pick-me-up for the traditional coffee drinker. Execution was targeted and deliberate, focusing on specific occasions and channels like the mid-afternoon pick-me-up in coffee shops and at work, and the early results are very promising, delivering incremental growth to the Coca-Cola brand with very little catalyzation., Vietnam, Coke\\nPlus Coffee, Coffee Category, Execution, Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, While this is just one specific example, it is indicative of the broader strategic approach we\\'re taking to reinvigorate the sparkling category. It\\'s about leveraging brand edge and innovation to build consumption rituals by offering people what they want when and where they want it. Actions like this around the world have helped us accelerate the performance of Coke trademarks, with global volume up 2% year to date., Strategic\\nApproach, Brand Edge, Innovation, Consumption Rituals, Volume Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Of course, driving disciplined growth is not just about expanding our beverage portfolio, it\\'s about shaping quality leadership for sustainable revenue profit and cash flow growth. Therefore, it is critical that we reduce complexity to ensure our system sales force is focused, our supply chain is efficient, and our innovation pipeline gains more space and visibility at the point of sale. To that end, we\\'ve been identifying and killing zombie brands and SKUs while focusing our teams on the work that matters most., Disciplined\\nGrowth, Quality Leadership, Complexity Reduction, Innovation Pipeline, System Sales Force, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Many of you have asked what we mean by \"zombie brands,\" and where the opportunities are, so let me try and give a few examples. Earlier this year, our Middle East and North Africa business unit identified more than 125 underperforming SKUs to eliminate. To date, we\\'ve discontinued 60% of those and intend to delist the rest by the end of the year, allowing us to reallocate resources to brands and strategic initiatives that are delivering the highest return. Given the benefits we\\'re seeing, of course, we\\'re embedding the elimination of zombie SKUs and brands even further into existing routines, instilling this discipline deeper into our business units., Zombie Brands,\\nUnderperforming SKUs, Elimination, Resource Reallocation, Discipline, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, This taking a more disciplined approach to our portfolio is only one of the ways we\\'re looking to reduce complexity in the business. We\\'re also constantly focusing our teams on the work that matters most: Driving a productivity mindset in the business with the aim of both funding reinvestment and driving cash flow improvements. For example, after a recent review, we\\'ve significantly reduced the number of strategic projects in one of our largest business units to ensure that we\\'re sufficiently allocating resources to the highest-return-on-investment projects rather than targeting too many actions at once. This is building on the previous productivity actions we\\'ve laid out and helping us to drive strong 8% underlying operating income growth for the first half of the year while continuing to reinvest behind our brands. This ultimately is not just about growth for the sake of growing. Growth must translate into solid returns for our investors., Disciplined\\nApproach, Portfolio Management, Productivity Mindset, Resource Allocation, Growth Translation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, James Quincey, President and Chief Executive Officer, So, taking a step back and looking at the remainder of the year, global economic growth remains robust. Now, of course, there is some level of uncertainty from geopolitical risk and escalating trade conflicts, but our industry remains vibrant and growing, and we are winning, and we have momentum in the business. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly since the beginning of the year, increasing our current currency headwinds in the back half, but all in all, with increasing currency headwinds partially offset by momentum in the business, we remain focused on delivering the earnings guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year. Let me now turn the call over to Kathy., Global\\nEconomic Growth, Uncertainty, Geopolitical Risk, Trade Conflicts, Currency Headwinds, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As James mentioned, we saw strong underlying growth in the quarter. We delivered 5% organic revenue growth through balanced growth in our volume and price mix, giving us confidence in our top-line acceleration. The solid organic revenue growth combined with our ongoing productivity measures drove 8% underlying operating income growth in the quarter., Strong Growth,\\nBalanced Growth, Top-Line Acceleration, Productivity Measures, Underlying Operating Income Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, While the underlying results are strong, as you know, our reported financials continue to be affected by accounting changes enacted at the beginning of this year and from cycling bottling refranchising activities last year. Our comparable operating margin increased more than 300 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an almost 200-basis-point impact from the new accounting standards and currency. Productivity helped to drive the underlying operating margin expansion with actions across all of our operating segments. However, we saw a particular benefit in our corporate segment due to the Lean Center initiative we began during the second quarter of last year., Strong\\nUnderlying Results, Accounting Changes, Comparable Operating Margin, Productivity Measures, Lean\\nCenter Initiative, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, The accounting impact from the change in revenue recognition was in line with our expectations. It\\'s important to note that the impact varies significantly by operating segment. For example, the impact of operating margins was the most extreme for North America, resulting in over 200 basis points of compression in that segment\\'s margin. Below the line, performance was as we expected, allowing us to deliver comparable EPS growth of $0.61, up 3% in the quarter., Accounting\\nImpact, Operating Segments, Comparable EPS Growth, Performance Below the Line, North America Margin\\nCompression, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, So, to turn to the remainder of the year, considering our strong performance in the first half of the year and for reasons James spoke to, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue and underlying operating income growth. Specifically, we now expect organic revenue growth of at least 4% and underlying operating income growth of at least 9%. At the same time, the expected currency headwind to full-year operating income is now expected to be 4%, an increase of 3 to 4 points since the beginning of the year. And, as James mentioned, we remain focused on delivering full-year comparable EPS growth within our previously provided range of 8% to 10%., Strong\\nPerformance, Guidance Update, Currency Headwinds, Full-Year Comparable EPS Growth, Focus on\\nDelivering Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to cash flow, we now expect to generate cash from operations of approximately $8 billion. This is down from our initial outlook of at least $8.5 billion, largely driven by higher-than-anticipated tax payments related to an amendment of the prior year\\'s tax return and stronger currency headwinds. And, we remain disciplined in our capital allocation. We now expect to reinvest $1.7 billion in the business through capital expenditures. And, we will return our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and an expected $1 billion in net share repurchases. Finally, we are on track to pay down approximately $7 billion in gross debt, as previously discussed., Cash Flow, Tax\\nPayments, Capital Allocation, Dividends, Net Share Repurchases, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, So, as you model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of phasing. We expect currency headwinds to negatively impact both net revenue and operating income in the second half of the year. We expect the change in revenue recognition to benefit operating income in the third quarter, which is a reversal of the headwinds we recognized in the second quarter. And, we expect structural impacts to moderate as we move through the remainder of the year. Finally, we expect our comparable EPS growth to be higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter due to an additional day in the fourth quarter and cycling the impact of last year\\'s natural disasters. As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each element in more detail as you build out your models of the year., Currency\\nHeadwinds, Revenue Recognition, Structural Impacts, Comparable EPS Growth, Investor Relations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 2, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, So, in summary, we delivered solid financial performance year to date and we remain focused on delivering full-year comparable EPS growth within our previously provided range of 8% to 10%. Operator, we are now ready for questions., Full-Year\\nComparable EPS Growth, Focus on Delivering Growth, Summary of Financial Performance, Operator\\'s\\nQuestions, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, James Quincey, The Coca-Cola Co. -- President, Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. 2018 is off to a good start backed by strong financial performance and volume acceleration. Our results build on our continued execution against the strategic priorities that we first shared with you more than a year ago: accelerating our transformation into a total beverage company with a broad consumer-centric brand portfolio, an asset-light business model, and a performance driven growth culture. Our strategies are working. And while our quarterly phasing will be lumpy, we\\'re on track to deliver our plan this year. Improving global economy helped the non-alcoholic beverage industry grow a little faster. And our actions enabled us to gain global value share. During the quarter, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth, driven by growth across all our operating segments. Concentrate shipments grew 4%, driven by an acceleration at developing and emerging markets as well as the timing of shipments during the quarter., Strong\\nFinancial Performance, Volume Acceleration, Strategic Priorities, Global Economy Growth, Concentrate\\nShipments Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, James Quincey, The Coca-Cola Co. -- President, Chief Executive Officer, Price mix was 1%, trending lower than our recent run rate, largely due to timing across multiple markets as well as a few factors impacting North America during the quarter. Those of you who follow us closely will notice that our organic revenue composition was driven more by volume and less by price than last year. While I expect that top-line composition, however, to be more balanced between volume and price mix over the remainder of the year, I\\'m encouraged with the start to this year and the sustainability of our growth. Importantly, I\\'m also pleased that we converted top-line growth into 9% underlaying operating income growth, even in the face of a rising cost environment. As such, I am confident in our ability to achieve our bottom-line outlook. Looking around the world, organic revenue growth and volume growth were broad-based with growth across every operating segment. In addition to momentum in the business, volume benefited from the timing of Easter and Chinese New Year this year., Price Mix, Organic\\nRevenue Composition, Top-Line Growth, Bottom-Line Outlook, Global Volume Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, James Quincey, The Coca-Cola Co. -- President, Chief Executive Officer, We also saw revenue and volume growth in each of our category clusters as we continue to focus on our total beverage platform. Even as we evolve our portfolio, our foundation is strong. For example, trademark Coca-Cola led the way, growing volume a healthy 4% globally, due to improving trends in our developing and emerging markets along with strong momentum in our low- and no-calorie variants. In North America, organic revenue grew 1% as stronger volume growth was partially offset by 1% decline in price mix. We delivered solid performance in the marketplace, gaining value share. Innovation across our multiple category clusters, including sparkling and our Zero Sugar portfolio drove strong consumer uptake. North American price mix declined 1% as positive low-single digit underlaying pricing was offset by a few factors, which Kathy will walk you through. Given the change in reported price mix, I wanna be clear. Our pricing strategy has not changed., Revenue Growth,\\nVolume Growth, Category Clusters, Price Mix, Innovation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, James Quincey, The Coca-Cola Co. -- President, Chief Executive Officer, We have seen a clear benefit in our move from volume-centric to value-centric mindset. And that philosophy has not changed. You can see evidence of this as we achieve positive retail pricing in Nielsen all measure channels, even with Easter in the quarter. And since then, we\\'ve seen retail pricing accelerate. We remain committed to take the actions needed to earn price and value in the marketplace. And we expect to achieve low-single digit price mix for our total beverage portfolio in North America again this year. Now looking at markets outside of North America, Europe delivered strong organic revenue growth as we launched new products like FUZE Tea while continuing to drive revenue growth management initiatives. China and India accelerated top-line growth in the quarter. And we also saw better performance in some of the markets that have been struggling, notably Brazil and Argentina. Now let me just talk a little bit about some of the actions we\\'ve taken to achieve these results., Positive Retail\\nPricing, Value-Centric Mindset, Price Mix Acceleration, Global Top-Line Growth, Actions Taken, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, James Quincey, The Coca-Cola Co. -- President, Chief Executive Officer, Across all our markets, and especially in the developed markets, consumers are seeking more beverage choices by looking for products that fit different needs, moods, and moments. To meet these desires, we are shaping and expanding our portfolio through innovation, expansion of the lift, shift, and scale model, and bolt-on M&A all being driven by a disciplined approach to growth. For example, the global ready to drink tea category represents $60 billion in retail value, and it\\'s projected to continue growing solidly as consumers seek out more natural beverage choices that can deliver functional benefits. Our tea portfolio has grown over the past several years, chiefly behind the strength of three large brands: FUZE Tea, Ayataka, and Gold Peak, as well as strong local and regional brands such as Honest Tea. Earlier, I mentioned the launch of FUZE Tea in Europe. At the end of last year, FUZE Tea was available in almost 50 countries, but had not yet been launched in Europe., Beverage Choices,\\nInnovation, Portfolio Expansion, M&A, Global Ready-to-Drink Tea Category, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, James Quincey, The Coca-Cola Co. -- President, Chief Executive Officer, At the beginning of this year, we initiated a complex rollout. This required a flexible and agile approach as we successfully launched the brand in 37 countries in a single day. While we still have a lot of distribution to build, we are ahead of plan. With this expansion, we have effectively doubled the value of the FUZE Tea brand globally. This is a great example of how we can rapidly lift and shift proven successful brands and scale them quickly. We are also working to scale high growth brands we\\'ve acquired. Last October, we acquired the US rights to Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water from Mexico, with the intent of using our Venturing and Emerging Brands unit as an incubator to guide the expansion of the brand\\'s distributional footprint. By the end of the first quarter, our first full quarter of ownership, we increased distribution coverage within the highly valuable convenience retail channel by 25%. Finally, we continue to innovate in our core brands., Complex Rollout,\\nGlobal Expansion, Brand Value, Distribution Coverage, Innovation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, James Quincey, The Coca-Cola Co. -- President, Chief Executive Officer, I\\'ve spoken before about our success with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. During the first quarter, the brand continued its trend of strong, double digit volume and revenue growth globally. And in North America, we\\'ve been working hard to reinvigorate the Diet Coke brand through an integrated approach. We introduced new packaging, a new marketing campaign, and new flavors designed to appeal to the next generation of consumers. We got off to a strong start, returning Diet Coke to growth in North America. Now we recognize it\\'s still very early in the process, but we are encouraged by the initial consumer response. Importantly, I\\'m pleased to see the team take bold action to change the trajectory of the results. Our strategy is to focus on specific growth disciplines and capabilities. Digital marketing is a capability that helps us build strong connections with younger consumers., Coca-Cola Zero\\nSugar, Diet Coke, North America, Global Volume Growth, Digital Marketing, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, James Quincey, The Coca-Cola Co. -- President, Chief Executive Officer, For example, during Chinese New Year, we launched a digital marketing campaign with one of the country\\'s largest online and mobile payment providers. This integrated campaign connected brand Coca-Cola with the cultural rituals of Chinese New Year through an augmented reality shopper smartphone experience. Packaging innovation is another capability that plays an important role in building and maintaining relevance, particularly when coupled with broader marketing campaigns. Again, in China, we created sleek cans with localized labels portraying cities across the country. We partnered with leading internet providers to create an integrated digital experience where consumers learn more about these cities by scanning the cans with their mobile devices. This premium price revenue growth initiative has been very successful in attracting a new generation of Chinese consumers., Digital Marketing\\nCampaign, Packaging Innovation, Premium Price Revenue Growth, Integrated Digital Experience, New\\nGeneration of Consumers, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, James Quincey, The Coca-Cola Co. -- President, Chief Executive Officer, The two digital initiatives I just described helped generate nearly $1 billion consumer impressions, supported the strong performance of brand Coca-Cola in China, where volume grew over 20% in the quarter. With so much going on in our business, it can at times be challenging to sit back and see the commonalities that is driving our performance across the various categories and geographies. However, when I think about it, the shift in our culture, one that is moving faster, taking more risks, and approaching growth with discipline, this is the single largest driver of our performance. For example, after launching FUZE Tea in Western Europe, we had an opportunity to enhance the attractiveness of our packaging. So, we worked with Coca-Cola European partners to revamp the packaging just launched. Revamped the packaging graphics in less than eight weeks. At the end of the day, speed and agility are critical for success in this rapidly changing consumer landscape., Shift in Culture,\\nGrowth Discipline, Packaging Innovation, Speed and Agility, Consumer Landscape, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, James Quincey, The Coca-Cola Co. -- President, Chief Executive Officer, Of course, all of this is supported by a stronger global bottling system. Our bottling partners are energized. They\\'re investing in capabilities and assets, driving enhanced execution, and focused on bringing a total beverage portfolio to the customers. Looking toward the remainder of the year, there\\'s a lot of activity ahead. We\\'re implementing new revenue growth management initiatives in several countries, launching new products across geographies, and adapting to new taxes in certain markets like the UK and South Africa. With that said, I\\'m confident in our overall plan and with the guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year. Specifically, we expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth and 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth this year. Kathy, over to you., Global Bottling\\nSystem, Revenue Growth Management Initiatives, New Product Launches, Taxes in Certain Markets,\\nEarnings Guidance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, Kathy N. Waller, The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid, underlaying financial results slightly ahead of our expectations due to the timing of shipments, with 5% organic revenue growth and operating expense leverage driving 9% growth in underlaying operating income. This translated into strong comparable EPS growth of 8%. And based on where we stand today, we remain confident that we can deliver our full-year guidance of 4% organic revenue growth and 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth. Today, I\\'ll cover three topics: Price mix, our comparable results, and our outlook. Starting with price mix, as James mentioned, our consolidated price mix trended lower than our recent run rate, largely due to timing as well as a few factors impacting North America during the quarter. However, as we move through the year, we expect the timing factors to reverse into a net benefit and for the pressure in North America to moderate, resulting in stronger global price mix., Price Mix,\\nComparable Results, Outlook, North America, Global Performance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, Kathy N. Waller, The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In North America, price mix during the quarter was unfavorably impacted by the timing of new product launches, incremental outbound freight costs, and the shift of the Easter holiday. Like other CPG companies, we faced significant freight headwinds in North America this year. Historically, we have accounted for the cost of outbound freight as a reduction from revenue. Therefore, it impacts our price mix calculations. We estimate that this will be a one-point impact on North America\\'s full-year price mix. It will be more frontloaded due to the timing of when freight costs again increasing last year. Outside of North America, emerging and developing markets outpaced developed markets in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA operating group, impacting price mix at the group level. However, at the local level, we generated positive price mix in most of our markets., North America, Price\\nMix, Freight Costs, Emerging Markets, Developed Markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, Kathy N. Waller, The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And in Latin America, we continue to benefit from strong price mix in our Mexico and South Latin business units while operating in an overall low inflationary environment. Turning to our comparable financial performance in the quarter, as I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, there are two factors creating noise in our comparable financial performance this year with varying impacts by quarter and by operating segment. So first, structural. We expect comparable revenue and operating income to decline on an absolute basis, the growth in operating margins to improve as we cycle exiting lower margin, capital intensive businesses last year. Second, as we mentioned on the fourth quarter call, two new accounting standards went into effect this quarter. The first requires companies to split out net tension expense, keeping the service cost in SG&A and moving the other components of tension expense to other income. So, in accordance, we issued reclassified 2017 quarterly and full-year financial information on April 3rd., Latin America, Price\\nMix, Comparable Financial Performance, Structural Growth, New Accounting Standards, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, Kathy N. Waller, The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And that continued at comparable. The second pertains to revenue recognition. The primary impact this quarter that certain revenue and costs and contracts that were previously netted together in revenue are now growth up into their revenue and [inaudible] components. We expect this will result in higher growth in both comparable net revenue and cost of goods sold with no material impact to gross profit or operating income for the full year. However, this will mathematically affect the calculation of gross and operating margin. An example is outbound freight, which is now, after the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard, accounted for as part of cost of goods sold. As I said earlier, this was previously recorded as a reduction to revenue. The price to the customer includes outbound freight. However, we applied this accounting change to effect that did not restate our historical financial statement., Revenue Recognition,\\nGross Profit, Operating Income, Accounting Standards, Outbound Freight, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, Kathy N. Waller, The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Therefore, in organic revenue, we have adjusted for that change to make our 2018 quarterly results comparable to the 2017 comparative period. As a result, both our organic revenue growth and price mix will continue to be impacted by the outbound freight costs this year. So, looking at our performance in the quarter, comparable net revenue declined as organic revenue growth and benefits in the new accounting standard and currency tailwind were more than offset by a 26% structural impact from cycling bottler refranchising last year. However, comparable operating margin increased 600 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlaying performance partially offset by an almost 100 basis point impact from the new accounting standard. Below the line, higher net interest expense offset higher other income and equity income in the quarter. And a lower effective tax rate and net share repurposes contributed to comparable EPS of $0.47, up 8% in the quarter., Organic Revenue\\nGrowth, Price Mix, Structural Impact, Comparable Operating Margin, Net Interest Expense, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, Kathy N. Waller, The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finally, we generated approximately $340 million in free cash flow, up 5%, driven by reduced capital investment needs as we divest bottling operations, partially offset by the impact of one less day in the quarter. Now looking at the remainder of the year, our full-year guidance remains intact. 4% organic revenue growth, 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth, and at least $8.5 billion in cash from operations. As we model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of savings. Consistent with what we said on the fourth quarter call, we still expect full-year EPS growth to be driven by the second half of the year, primarily due to the timing of expenses and productivity initiatives. Also, in the first quarter, concentrate shipments outpaced unit case volume growth, particularly in our EMEA operating segment. This pulled some revenue and profit into the first quarter. As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect this to normalize with full-year concentrate shipments running in line with unit case volume growth., Free Cash Flow,\\nFull-Year Guidance, EPS Growth, Expenses, Concentrate Shipments, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, Kathy N. Waller, The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Now there are also a few things to consider specific to the second quarter. We are adapting to new sugar excess taxes in both the UK and South Africa while cycling strong results from Western Europe last year. While we feel confident in our strategies and ability to adapt our portfolio to the new operating environment, we expect some level of impact, particularly as consumers first adjust to the new prices. And we are cycling a low SG&A base last year due to the timing of expenses. From a non-operational perspective, we expect a four- to five-point headwind from structural items and a one-point headwind from currencies on operating income. And we expect the change in revenue recognition to be a one- to two-point tailwind to revenue. And while we still expect the revenue recognition to have no impact to operating income for the full year, we do expect a two-point headwind to operating income in the second quarter that will reverse in the third quarter., Sugar Excise Taxes,\\nCycling Strong Results, Non-Operational Items, Revenue Recognition, Operating Income, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2018, 1, Kathy N. Waller, The Coca-Cola Co. -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, So, these considerations taken together will put pressure on comparable EPS growth in the second quarter relative to our full-year targets. As always, our investor relations team will be happy to walk through each element in more detail as you build out your models for the year. So, in summary, we delivered solid, underlaying financial performance in the quarter. This translated into strong, comparable EPS growth. And we are on track to deliver our full-year guidance of 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth. Operator, we are now ready for questions., Comparable EPS\\nGrowth, Full-Year Guidance, Investor Relations, Second Quarter Performance, Pressure on EPS Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In 2017 we concluded another solid quarter of operating performance capping off a successful year. The non-alcoholic beverage industry was a little softer in 2017 as the emerging and developing markets slowed slightly from prior year, but the developed world continued this growth trajectory. We continued to gain global value share for both the quarter and the year, and importantly, we achieved or exceeded the guidance we shared with you at the beginning of 2017. Full year organic revenue grew 3% with four out of five category clusters delivering topline growth led by our sparkling soft drink portfolio. Underlying PBT grew 9% versus our goal of 7% to 8% as we accelerated the capture of certain productivity savings. And we delivered comparable EPS of $1.91, which was ahead of our plan. While we did what we said we\\'d do, it\\'s still not as much as we aspire to. We need to be growing revenue and EPS at a faster rate., 2017 Performance,\\nNon-Alcoholic Beverage Industry, Global Value Share, Organic Revenue Growth, Comparable EPS, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Now, looking around the world, all of our operating segments delivered positive organic revenue growth. we saw solid growth in our developed markets, particularly in Europe and North America, driven by improving execution in recently refranchised territories and enhanced pricing and packaging strategies., Positive Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Developed Markets, Execution in Recently Refranchised Territories, Enhanced Pricing\\nand Packaging Strategies, Global Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Our China business built momentum in 2017 even as we refranchised our bottling system. Other emerging markets were more challenging, especially in the first half of the year, but we saw improvement in key markets like India, Argentina, and Brazil as we moved into the second half. We accomplished this growth while driving significant change at your company as we accelerated our transformation into a total beverage company with a broad, consumer-centric brand portfolio and an asset-light business model., China Business,\\nEmerging Markets, Momentum, Change at the Company, Total Beverage Company, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, First, we implemented a new operating model designed to enable an accountable, performance-driven growth culture that we will believe will result in greater returns for our shareholders: a lean model with employees who are focused, empowered, quick to take action and willing to make smart risks. To accomplish this, we made significant changes to our leadership team, corporate structure, and updated both our incentive metrics and compensation philosophy., New Operating\\nModel, Accountable Culture, Performance-Driven Growth, Leadership Changes, Incentive Metrics, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Second, we implemented new, digital platforms to support our leaner operating environment and improve the employee experience. This lays the groundwork for initiates like the SAP implementation that will take place this year., New Digital\\nPlatforms, Leaner Operating Environment, Employee Experience, SAP Implementation, Groundwork, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Third, we expanded our consumer-centric product portfolio scaling wins from market to market, leveraging M&A, and embracing more of an experimental test and learn approach to marketing new products. For example, we entered the fast-growing US ready to drink coffee category capturing over 7 points of value share by the end of the year. We lifted and shifted two of our leading US brands, Honest and SmartWater, into multiple international markets and acquired Ades, the leading plant-based beverage brand in Latin America with the intention of expanding it into Europe in the near future., Consumer-\\nCentric Product Portfolio, Market Expansion, M&A, Experimental Test and Learn Approach,\\nInternational Markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, More importantly, we launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in 20 markets with a clear four points label of a great tasting, reformulated product, evolved marketing, new packaging, and upgraded execution. We saw very positive results with the brand growing revenue double digits including a meaningful acceleration in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar\\'s trend in the US since its launch in Q3., Coca-Cola Zero\\nSugar, Great Tasting Product, Evolved Marketing, New Packaging, Upgraded Execution, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Of course, it\\'s not just about large brands. We balanced rolling out large-scale brands with keeping an entrepreneurial focus on emerging consumer trends and identifying products that meet those trends. This is about developing brands, channels, and points of engagements with our consumers. For example, we adjust our pack price offering to adapt to the explosion of online ordering in China, and we\\'re leveraging a decade of learnings from North America\\'s venturing in emerging brands model to approach opportunities in international markets. As I mentioned last quarter, we launched a unit in central and eastern Europe to test premium brands in high-value outlets and channels through a separate root to market. And, of course, while it\\'s still early days, the unit has met our expectations, and we are moving quickly to expand coverage to another seven cities in Europe., Large Brands,\\nEmerging Consumer Trends, Developing Brands, Online Ordering, International Markets, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Fourth, we focused on converting portfolio expansion into stronger revenue growth. This can clearly be seen in EMIR our operating segment where organic revenue growth accelerated from a 3% run rate over the past few years to a strong 5% in 2017. We accomplished this in part due to the revenue growth management initiatives that focuses on small baskets and pack sizes. These initiatives were phased into several EMIR markets over the year, and we will continue to roll them out in additional markets in 2018. And so expect to see continued momentum this year., Portfolio\\nExpansion, Revenue Growth Management, Small Baskets and Pack Sizes, EMIR Markets, Momentum, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, And, finally, we energized our system for future growth. Over the last few years, as you well know, we have been returning ownership of our company-owned bottling operations to independent companies around the world. In 2017, we accomplished major milestones in three of our most important markets. We sold our bottling businesses in China creating two strong bottlers with contiguous territories. Our two largest bottlers in Japan merged creating a single bottler covering roughly 85% of our system in that important profit pool, and most importantly we completed refranchising of our US bottling operations., Energizing\\nSystem, Returning Ownership, Independent Bottlers, Major Milestones, Refranchising, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, At the same time, our North America business continued to deliver top-tier FMCG performance with 3% organic revenue growth. Ultimately, all of these strategic and tactical changes means something very important. We are observably shifting our culture: the way we operate, the way we look at growth opportunities, and the way we engage with our bottling systems. It\\'s been a lot of change, and much of it is only just starting to show tangible results, which is a good thing when you think about future performance., Top-Tier FMCG\\nPerformance, Strategic Changes, Tactical Changes, Shifting Culture, Tangible Results, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Looking ahead, 2018 is shaping up to be stronger than 2017. We are well positioned to accelerate our topline performance based on the actions we\\'ve taken, the impact of new US tax legislation on consumer spending, and the improvement in the global economy. And while the economic environments in key emerging markets like Brazil and Argentina may not yet have tipped into a tailwind scenario, they are also not causing the same level of headwinds they did last year for our industry., 2018\\nPerformance, New US Tax Legislation, Global Economy, Emerging Markets, Tailwind Scenario, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, With that as a backdrop, we feel confident that the revenue growth initiatives we\\'ve launched in multiple markets, coupled with the strong rollout of brands like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fuze Tea, added smart base beverages and SmartWater will enable us to deliver 4% organic revenue growth. We will balance productivity with reinvestment to deliver significant underlying operating new margin expansion for the year. And our refranchising efforts largely complete and a benign currency environment, we expect to go comparable EPS 8% to 10%., Revenue Growth\\nInitiatives, Brand Rollout, Productivity and Reinvestment, Underlying Operating Margin Expansion,\\nComparable EPS Growth, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Now, of course, many of you have asked us how US tax reform will impact our business. Overall, we view this as encouraging for the operating environment. Clearly, tax reform will make investing in the US more attractive and should spur economic growth. We are currently evaluating it and expect our system to accelerating investments to capture further opportunities. The tax reform also eliminates a long-standing distortion due to the former US worldwide tax system, which will make it easier for our company to manage its cash and debt balances. However, in the short term, there are puts and takes to the financial benefit. Over the next eight years, the lower effective tax rate will mostly be offset by the annual payment on the tax charge we took during the fourth quarter., US Tax Reform,\\nEconomic Growth, Investments, Cash and Debt Balances, Short-Term Offset, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, Now, while we are focused on delivering this year\\'s plan, we must also keep an eye on the long-term health of our business. In order to have a healthy business, you need to operate in a healthy community. One of today\\'s biggest problems is packaging waste, and over the decades Coca-Cola has done a lot of work on recycling. We made most of our packaging fully recyclable, and we have invested a lot of R&D around reusing plastic. And now we\\'re doing more. Our system is fundamentally reshaping our approach to packaging with a goal to collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of all the bottles and cans we sell by 2030., Healthy\\nBusiness, Packaging Waste, Recyclable Packaging, R&D for Reusing Plastic, Reshaping Approach to\\nPackaging, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also increasing the amount of recycled content in our packaging, and we\\'re working to make all of our packaging finally 100% recyclable. In a world where packaging waste, especially plastic waste, is a growing problem, we\\'re working to make sure that no bottle is ever a single-use bottle. Through recycling, it\\'ll have more than one life. This is the next step in our ongoing sustainability efforts building off our success in replenishing 100 percent of the water we use in making our beverages. We must grow with conscience, and therefore becoming a total beverage company that grows the right way because it is the correct thing to do for the consumers and our business., Recycled\\nContent, Recyclable Packaging, Sustainability Efforts, Growing with Conscience, Total Beverage\\nCompany, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, James Quincey, Chief Executive Officer, So, finally, to recap, we had a successful year. We implemented a culture shift, which is ongoing. We made large-scale changes to strengthen our bottling system, met or exceeded our financial guidance, and delivered top-tier FMCG organic revenue growth. and we are encouraged that 2018 will be even stronger. With that, I\\'m gonna hand over to Kathy., Successful\\nYear, Culture Shift, Large-Scale Changes, Financial Guidance, Encouragement for 2018, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As James said, 2017 was a good year as we met or exceeded our financial guidance during significant change at the company. Our press release covers our fourth quarter results in detail but will focus on the implications from the US tax reform to accounting changes that will affect our operating margins and our 2018 guidance., US Tax Reform,\\nAccounting Changes, Financial Guidance, Significant Change at the Company, Fourth Quarter Results, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Starting with the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while I won\\'t touch on every element, I think there are three important factors to review: the impact of our underlying effective tax rate, the tax liability on our foreign accumulated earnings, and capital structure implication., Tax Cuts, Effective\\nTax Rate, Foreign Earnings, Capital Structure, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, First, based on our expected earnings split between US and international locations, we estimate this will lower our global effective tax rate to approximately 21% in 2018 compared to our 24% rate in 2017 and our previously expected 2018 tax rate of 26%. However, we expect increased variability from quarter to quarter as future interpretations of the law and updates to the related accounting guidance could have an impact on our effective tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Therefore, the 21% effective tax rate estimate is just that, an estimate, and will be subject to change. As we go through the year, we will update you on any potential changes., Tax Rate, Effective\\nTax Rate, International Locations, Accounting Guidance, Variability, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Second, in the fourth quarter, we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $3.6 billion associated with the enactment. The charge encompasses several elements including a one-time $4.6 billion tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a primarily offsetting net deferred tax benefit of $1 billion. Despite being recorded in the fourth quarter, the one-time tax will be paid over an eight-year period as stipulated by the act. So, the cash flow impacts from the $4.6 billion charge will fall in future periods but will be more than offset by the accumulated cash benefit from the lower ongoing tax rate after a six to seven year payback period., Tax, Foreign\\nEarnings, Non-Cash Charge, Cash Flow, Payback Period, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, While the accumulated impact is a benefit to free cash flow, the tax payments impact the company\\'s free cash flow conversion target over the next years. At our investor day last November, we introduced a free cash flow conversion target of 95% to 100% of GAAP net income adjusted to exclude noncash items impacting comparability. While the lower effective tax rate will benefit both earnings and cash flow by the same amount, the tax on historical foreign earnings will only impact our free cash flow. So, this has the mathematical effect of lowering our free cash flow conversion. Since the impact of tax reform was not anticipated when we provided the guidance during our investor day, we are not adjusting our target to 90% to 95% during this eight-year period of tax payments., Tax, Free Cash Flow,\\nConversion Rate, Mathematical Impact, Adjustment, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to implications on our capital structure and cash repatriation, now that the US has moved to a modified, territorial regime, it will make it easier to manage our cash and debt. As a result, we are providing a few updates to our capital structure. First, we have a target of 2 to 2.5 times net debt leverage as we believe this provides the right balance between reaching the optimal capital structure and persevering financial flexibility as we move forward on strategic initiatives. We currently operate at 3.9 times growth debt leverage and 2.2 times net debt leverage with a credit rating of AA- from S&P and an Aa3 from Moody\\'s., Capital Structure,\\nCash Repatriation, Debt Leverage, Financial Flexibility, Credit Rating, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Since we are already operating within our target net leverage range, we intend to use approximately $7 billion of our cash held overseas to repay gross debt. This will allow us to reduce the spread between our growth and net debt level, support our credit rating, and continue to access the commercial paper market and reduce our net interest expense. The remaining cash will continue to be invested overseas as a significant portion of it is non-remittable because of local regulations or is required for working capital purposes. Another portion is required to support our commercial paper program, and then some of the cash is earning a good return in certain overseas markets. And, finally, our cash priorities remain the same. We will continue to reinvest in the business, grow the dividend, find the acquisitions, and use any remaining cash for net share repurchases., Cash Repatriation,\\nDebt Repayment, Credit Rating, Commercial Paper, Net Share Repurchases, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, As we move forward, we will periodically reevaluate and balance our opportunities with our cash flow needs. At times and as appropriate, if we have access cash, we could use that cash to buy back shares above our previously stated goal of offsetting any equity dilution., Cash Flow, Share\\nBuyback, Equity Dilution, Opportunities, Balance, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Moving on to changes in accounting standards, the FASB, which is the Financial Accounting Standards Board, issued an accounting standards update on revenue from customer contracts. Based on clarifications provided by this new guidance, we will now be required to account for a small number of contracts differently in the future. While there are various considerations, the primary impact will be that certain revenue and costs and contracts that were previously netted together in revenue will now be grossed up into their revenue and cost of goods sold components going forward., Revenue Recognition,\\nAccounting Standards Update, Contracts, Grossing Up, Netting, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Further, as this change is prospective, meaning there\\'s no restatement of prior results, this will result in an estimated increase in net revenue growth of 1% to 2% and an increase of 3% to 5% in cost of goods sold in 2018. Importantly, there is no material impact to our consolidated profit or EPS as a result. However, the math of this accounting change does result in operating margin compression. This change impacts the operating segments in different ways and causes a timing different, which impacts the quarter. Supplementary materials with additional details on the impact to our operating segments and our quarters are filed on our website, and our investor relations team can cover any additional questions with you., Net Revenue Growth,\\nCost of Goods Sold, Operating Margin Compression, Timing Differences, Website Filings, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, The FASB also issued an accounting standards update on pensions and post-retirement benefit costs, which requires companies to split out net pension expense keeping the service cost and S&GA and moving the other components of pension expense to other income. As this is simply a reclass of the P&L, there is no impact to profit before tax or EPS. However, there is an impact to operating margin. Taking these two accounting changes together, we expect approximately 150 basis points of operating margin compression going forward., Pension Expense,\\nPost-Retirement Benefit Costs, Operating Margin Compression, Net Pension Expense, Other Income, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to full year 2018 expected performance, we expect organic revenue growth to accelerate to 4%. We expect comparable EPS to grow 8% to 10% with the majority of earnings growth coming from the second half of the year. And we expect cash from operations of at least $8.5 billion. This represents over a 20% rebound as certain cash costs associated with refranchising activity and with the restructuring of the organization in 2017. We will continue to follow our capital allocation priorities starting with an expected $1.9 billion on capital investment. This is higher than our long-term expected spend due to investments we are making in 2018 to enhance digital capability. And we will return our free cash flow this year through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and approximately $1 billion in net share repurchases. As announced yesterday, our board increased the dividends for the 56th year in a row to an annual equivalent to $1.56 per share up 5% from $1.48., Organic Revenue\\nGrowth, Earnings Growth, Cash from Operations, Capital Allocation Priorities, Dividend and Share\\nRepurchases, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Now let me touch on key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. We expect continued portfolio lift and shift initiatives, such as Coca-Coal Zero Sugar and Fuze Tea, strong marketplace execution like we\\'ve seen in EMIR and a slightly improving macro outlook to result in stronger, topline growth. Along with some improvement in the emerging markets, we see commodity prices rising. However, continued solid pricing and a focus on expense management will more than offset higher raw material cost. As such, we expect to deliver 8% to 9% underlying operating income growth., Topline Growth,\\nPortfolio Lift and Shift Initiatives, Marketplace Execution, Emerging Markets, Raw Material Costs, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, As mentioned previously, the accounting change for customer contracts will result in a 1% to 2% point tailwind to net revenue and a 3% to 5% point increase to cost of goods sold with a minimal effect on operating income. The pension accounting change will require a restatement to our 2017 results, and given the amount of the reclass, we do not expect it to impact our 2018 guidance on operating income., Net Revenue, Cost of\\nGoods Sold, Operating Income, Pension Accounting Change, Restatement, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to structural items, we will continue to see a structural headwind in 2018 primarily due to the timing of when certain bottling operations were sold last year and the planned refranchising of bottling territories in Canada this year. Therefore, for 2018, we expect a 17% headwind to revenue, and 2% headwind to operating income from structural items., Structural Headwind,\\nBottling Operations, Refranchising of Bottling Territories, Revenue, Operating Income, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, This will result, however, in an approximate 500 basis point benefit to comparable operating margins on top of solid underlying margin expansion in the core business. We expect currency to be a 0% to 1% headwind to operating income as improving spot rates will be offset if we cycle hedging gains from 2017. Below the line, we expect modest deleverage. While we plan to repatriate approximately $7 billion of overseas cash to pay down debt, higher interest rates will result an increase to net interest expense., Comparable Operating\\nMargins, Currency Headwind, Deleverage, Net Interest Expense, Overseas Cash Repatriation, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, These factors, along with our updated 21% effective tax rate, will lead to expected growth in comparable EPS of 8% to 10% in 2018. As we model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of phasing for the year. We expect earnings growth to be back-half weighted primarily due to the timing of expenses and productivity initiatives. Moving specifically to the first quarter, the first quarter will have one less day than the prior year first quarter. We expect a 6 point headwind from structural items and a one-point tailwind from currencies on operating income. And we expect the change in revenue recognition to be a 1 point tailwind to revenue and a neutral impact to operating income in the first quarter., Comparable EPS\\nGrowth, Phasing of Expenses and Productivity Initiatives, Structural Items, Currency Impact, Revenue\\nRecognition, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, Now, I realize that was a lot to cover, and as always, our investor relations team will be happy to walk through each of these elements in more detail as you build out your models over the year. So, in summary, we delivered against our guidance in 2017 during tremendous change in the organization and our broader system. We believe we are well positioned as we enter into 2018 and expect accelerated performance., Accelerated\\nPerformance, Guidance, Change in Organization, Broader System, Investor Relations, Coca-Cola Company\\nKO, 2017, 4, Kathy N. Waller, Chief Financial Officer, And then finally, abating headwinds from currency, macros, and structural impacts, along with an improving tax outlook will allow a significant acceleration in our comparable EPS versus the past several years., Acceleration,\\nComparable EPS Growth, Currency Headwinds, Macro Impacts, Tax Outlook, Coca-Cola Company\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We\\'re excited to discuss with you the results of a strong second quarter and our upwardly revised outlook for the year. Joining me are Walmart\\'s CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, John David Rainey. Following prepared remarks from Doug and John David, we\\'ll take your questions., Revenue, Outlook, Q2 Results, CEO, CFO, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, At that time, we will be joined by our segment CEOs, John Furner from Walmart U.S.; Judith McKenna from Walmart International; and Kath McLay from Sam\\'s Club. In order to address as many questions as we can in the time allotted for this call, please limit yourself to one question. The operator will mute your line after your question has been posed, and once management has responded, we will move to the next person in line. Today\\'s call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements., Revenue, Outlook, Q2 Results, CEO, CFO, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations, on our website at stock.walmart.com. Thank you for your interest in Walmart., Revenue, Outlook, Q2 Results, CEO, CFO, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had another strong quarter. We\\'re gaining share across markets and formats, growing units sold, transaction counts are positive across markets, and growth in operating income is outpacing sales. We\\'re really pleased with our first-half performance., Revenue,\\nGrowth, Share, Operating Income, Performance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, For the quarter, comp sales for Walmart U.S. were ahead of where we thought they\\'d be at 6.4%. Sam\\'s Club U.S. was 5.5%, and sales for international were up 11%, led by double-digit growth at Walmex and China., Revenue,\\nGrowth, Sales, International, Comp Sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Flipkart\\'s GMV was also strong. The team is driving results in the short term and building for the future. We\\'re a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better. We like who we are, and we like who are becoming., People,\\nTech, Omnichannel, GMV, Savings, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re positioned for growth. We can serve people how they want to be served, whether that\\'s in a store or club, picking up an order curbside or having it delivered. We continue to grow some of our newer businesses, which shape the overall model in a positive way, helping to enable us to grow profit faster than sales. We\\'re setting the right capital priorities., Growth,\\nServing, Businesses, Capital Priorities, Profit, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, And you can expect us to continue investing in the areas we\\'ve talked about, like technology, including automation, store and club remodels, and with new stores and clubs in select markets. As it relates to technology, our approach to new tools like generative AI is to focus on making shopping easier and more convenient for our customers and members and helping our associates enjoy more satisfying and productive work. Ultimately, the power of generative AI or e-technology is only as good as the data that powers it. Our data assets are unique, and we\\'re excited about the potential to leverage them in new and impactful ways., Technology,\\nInvesting, Shopping, Data, Associates, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re taking large language models developed by our partners and by the broader tech community and adding retail context to create models that are uniquely suited to the needs of our customers, our associates, and our supply chain. We\\'ll unlock value for shareholders through the combination of our physical automation work with our data and increasingly intelligent software. We have a sharp focus on ROI as we drive results and set our capital priorities. The financial framework we laid out at our investment community meeting in April is evident in our results from the last two quarters., ROI, Capital Priorities, Automation, Data, Software, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, The remodel program I mentioned includes items to support our goal of becoming a regenerative company as we put things like new refrigeration equipment and EV charging stations in place. I was in Chile last week where I got to participate in the grand opening of a new hydrogen plant in Santiago that supports our strong business in that country. While I\\'m on the subject of regeneration, we recently announced a new collaboration focused on supporting U.S. and Canadian farmers to help improve soil health and water quality., Regeneration, Sustainability, Equipment, Hydrogen, Farming, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Our collective goal is to enable and accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices on more than 2 million acres of farmland and deliver 4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals by 2030. Some days I still get amazed by all the good work happening across our company. As a global retailer, we see how our customers and members are affected by what\\'s happening at a macro level and how that influences their behaviors. Jobs, wages, and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers, but rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs, and tightening lending standards, and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure., Regenerative Agriculture, Adoption, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Customer Behaviors, Macro Level, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, I was in Calgary visiting stores a couple of weeks ago, and our Canadian customers are feeling the pinch of higher interest rates faster than in the U.S. given their shorter-term mortgages. When you put all this together, we see families that are discerning about what they\\'re spending on. They\\'re setting priorities and spending on the things they care most about., Discerning\\nSpending, Prioritization, Interest Rates, Mortgages, Family Budgets, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We saw that during the first half of the year with Chinese New Year and Easter and more recently, with July 4th and the start of back-to-school where sales are ahead of plan so far. We see them buying more private brand items, and they\\'re buying more grocery staples and in-home meal options consistent with eating at home. Our customers and members are resilient. They\\'re looking for value, and they trust us to be there for them., Sales, Customer\\nBehavior, Private Brand, Grocery Staples, Eating at Home, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We see people across income cohorts come to us more frequently looking to save money on everyday needs. That gives us an opportunity to drive conversion in more discretionary categories. We\\'re encouraged by how general merchandise performed during the second quarter versus our expectations. We still expect food, consumables, and health and wellness, primarily due to the popularity of some GLP-1 drugs, to grow as a percent of total in the back half., Saving\\nMoney, Everyday Needs, Conversion, Discretionary Categories, General Merchandise, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, But the trends we see in general merchandise sales make us feel more optimistic about those categories in the back half of the year. Our stores and clubs give us a competitive advantage and power our omnichannel model. Our curbside pickup business continues to grow as people look for ways to save time. And store fulfilled delivery is now growing faster than pickup across all three segments., General\\nMerchandise Sales, Omnichannel Model, Curbside Pickup, Store Fulfilled Delivery, Time Savings, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Delivery speed and accuracy are obviously important, and we lack how we\\'re leveraging our physical assets. In the U.S., we have more than 4,000 stores and nearly 600 Sam\\'s Clubs making same-day deliveries and in nearly 2,000 stores and clubs internationally. We\\'re increasingly measuring those deliveries in hours rather than days. In China, where we deliver from all our stores, nearly 80% of digital orders are delivered in under one hour., Delivery\\nSpeed, Accuracy, Physical Assets, Same-Day Deliveries, Hourly Delivery, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, I like how we\\'re constantly improving delivery speed. It\\'s important to our customers and to our strategy. And I like how we\\'re building mutually reinforcing businesses. Running great stores and scaling e-commerce are and will be our top priorities., Delivery Speed,\\nCustomer Priorities, Business Strategy, Store Operations, E-Commerce Scaling, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, The way we design them, along with our marketplace, fulfillment services, and advertising business is key. We\\'ll keep prioritizing omni-retail, but we have good opportunities in healthcare and financial services in multiple markets. The growth of PhonePe has been fantastic, and we\\'re building other financial products like Cashi in Mexico and through ONE here in the U.S. We continue to build our healthcare services capabilities with clinic expansion., Omni-Retail,\\nHealthcare Services, Financial Services, Clinic Expansion, PhonePe, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, As I look at the remainder of the year, our immediate focus is on getting product costs and retails down to fight inflation, which will help with mix; improving execution of pickup and delivery orders; expense management; and inventory management by item and category. I\\'ll wrap up by saying a big thank you to our associates. As always, they\\'re making a difference every day for our customers and members. As we close out back-to-school and get ready for the holidays, their execution day to day and commitment to our customers and members is as critical as ever., Product\\nCosts, Retail Prices, Execution of Orders, Expense Management, Inventory Management, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Thank you for your interest in our company. Over to you, John David., Interest,\\nCompany, John David, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, John David. Before we take your questions, I want to say a few words about the leadership changes we shared yesterday. Let\\'s start by celebrating Judith. She has done a fantastic job in many roles over the 27 years she\\'s been part of our company., Leadership\\nChanges, Judith, Company Leadership, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, She leaves her most recent role having delivered strong results and having transformed the business. It\\'s a different portfolio, better positioned for the future, better positioned for growth on the top and bottom line. She strengthened our culture and sets us up for a digital future at the same time. We\\'re grateful., Strong\\nResults, Business Transformation, Digital Future, Culture Strengthening, Gratitude, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re excited about Kath moving into the international leadership role. The results Kath and our team have delivered at Sam\\'s speak for themselves. Her experience and passion to serve customers and members will take us to the next level. It will be fun to watch her impact around the world., Kath,\\nInternational Leadership, Customer Service, Passion, Impact, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Some of you have met Chris Nicholas and know how capable he is. He joined us five years ago in a finance role but with previous experience in merchandising and operations in several markets around the world. He\\'ll keep our member obsession going in Sam\\'s Club U.S. and pick write-up where Kath left off., Chris\\nNicholas, Finance Role, Merchandising Experience, Operations Experience, Member Obsession, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We also shared yesterday that Kieran Shanahan will join John\\'s team and become our Walmart U.S. chief operating officer. Kieran has 25 years with our company working in a wide variety of roles in all three segments. He is well prepared to lead this big team and the change that\\'s coming through our automation investments in the supply chain., Kieran\\nShanahan, Walmart U.S. Chief Operating Officer, Automation Investments, Supply Chain, Change\\nManagement, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, As they fill these new roles, John, Kath, Chris, and Kieran will have all four worked in all three operating segments of our business. There\\'s not only a lot of store and club expertise in this group, but there\\'s also a great deal of digital and e-commerce experience. These are omnichannel merchants that are purpose-driven with proven leadership skills. The depth of leadership in our company is such an advantage, but times get passed and we keep running, keep changing and keep pushing things forward., Leadership\\nSkills, Omnichannel Merchants, Digital Experience, Purpose-Driven, Company Advantage, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, I want to say congratulations to all of them. And now, I\\'ll turn it back over to the operator. We\\'re happy to take your questions., Congratulations, Turnover, Questions, Operator, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Doug. I\\'d like to start by thanking our customers, associates, and partners for helping us deliver another strong quarter with better-than-expected results in sales, operating income, and adjusted EPS. Sales were strong across all segments, and we gained U.S. market share in grocery, in both units and dollars, while delivering gross margin rate expansion., Strong\\nQuarter, Better-Than-Expected Results, Sales Growth, Market Share, Gross Margin Rate Expansion, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Our focus on saving customers\\' time and money continues to resonate, especially in high-volume seasonal periods. We have good momentum in the business. Year to date, we grew sales by over 6.5%, adjusted operating income by about 12%, and adjusted EPS by roughly 8%. With our Q2 results coming in better than expected we\\'re increasing our full-year guidance, and we\\'re well positioned as we enter the back half., Time and\\nMoney, Sales Growth, Operating Income, Adjusted EPS, Full-Year Guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll discuss guidance shortly. But first, I\\'d like to review highlights of our Q2 results using our financial framework of growth, margins, and returns. Starting with growth. For the second quarter, constant-currency sales increased 5.5% or more than $8 billion., Growth,\\nSales Increase, Financial Framework, Margins, Returns, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 6.4% with growth in both store and digital transactions. Grocery and health and wellness sales continue to outperform, and we\\'re encouraged by the modest sequential improvement in general merchandise. E-commerce sales were up 24%, driven by store fulfilled pickup and delivery and advertising., Walmart\\nU.S., Comp Sales, Excluding Fuel, Grocery Sales, E-commerce Sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, We like the trends we\\'re seeing in e-commerce. Customers are increasingly counting on us for convenience, and they\\'re visiting our app and sites more often. In Q2, weekly active digital users grew more than 20%. Similar to Q1, consumer spending remains resilient at the headline level., E-commerce\\nTrends, Convenience, Digital Users, Consumer Spending, Resilience, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Customers are stretching their dollars further and seeking better value across more categories more often. We see grocery staples and in-home mill options being purchased more often. Sales of general merchandise kitchen tools like hand blenders and stand mixers have inflected higher as customers are preparing more food at home. They\\'re also buying more necessities and focusing on lower-priced items and brands., Customer\\nBehavior, Dollar Stretching, Grocery Sales, In-Home Meals, Kitchen Tools, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, And customers still want to celebrate key moments. Over the last year here in the U.S., we partnered with suppliers to utilize rollbacks and offer select seasonal baskets of goods at the same prices as last year, essentially removing the impact of inflation. Customer response has been strong, and sales have exceeded plan for events like Memorial Day, Fourth of July, and our Walmart+ Week savings event. We\\'re taking a similar inflation finding approach to back-to-school with a basket of 14 of the most popular classroom essentials for under $13., Customer\\nCelebrations, Seasonal Baskets, Inflation Finding, Back-to-School, Classroom Essentials, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, In our international segment, sales were strong, up 11% on a constant-currency basis, led by double-digit growth in Walmex, China, and Flipkart. E-commerce grew 26%, and we experienced positive store traffic across markets. Similar to the U.S., customers are still pressured by elevated inflation with spend over indexing toward food and consumables. We\\'re seeing higher private brand penetration across markets as customers globally look for a combination of value and quality., International Sales, Constant-Currency Basis, E-commerce Growth, Store Traffic, Private Brand\\nPenetration, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, And Sam\\'s Club U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, increased more than 5% with member fee income up 7%. On margins, consolidated gross margins increased 50 basis points as we lapped last year\\'s elevated levels of inventory markdowns and supply chain costs. These tailwinds were partially offset by ongoing category mix pressure as grocery and health and wellness sales outperformed general merchandise., Sam\\'s Club\\nU.S., Comp Sales, Excluding Fuel, Member Fee Income, Gross Margins, Category Mix Pressure, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, One of our strategic priorities is improving digital margins with an eye toward e-commerce profitability. I\\'m pleased with the progress we\\'re making, particularly in Walmart U.S. contribution profit, which has been driven by fulfillment efficiencies and better product margins. We\\'re leveraging our stores to fulfill more than 50% of digital orders and activating our local delivery networks to get product to customers faster at lower cost., Digital\\nMargins, E-commerce Profitability, Fulfillment Efficiencies, Product Margins, Local Delivery\\nNetworks, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, At our investment community meeting in April, I said that we expected 200 basis points of improvement in contribution profit this year, and we\\'re on track to achieve that goal. We\\'re also pleased with the performance of our higher-margin growth initiatives that reinforce our core omni-retail model. I\\'ll provide highlights on each of these. First, marketplace., Contribution Profit, Growth Initiatives, Marketplace, Omni-Retail Model, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re continuing to scale our marketplace in the U.S. with new items and sellers. The number of customers buying items on our marketplace increased 14% in Q2. Sales were strong in both consumables and general merchandise categories with double-digit growth across home, apparel, and hard lines., Marketplace\\nGrowth, Customer Buying Habits, Sales Performance, Category Growth, Double-Digit Growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, And the number of sellers utilizing our fulfillment services increased more than 50%. In Mexico, we also expanded the number of sellers and items available on the marketplace, resulting in 40% GMV growth for the quarter. In Canada, we opened our first automated e-commerce fulfillment center in Alberta, which includes Walmart fulfillment services and expands two-day shipping to 97% of households. And in India, Flipkart Myntra is the country\\'s largest e-commerce marketplace for fashion and lifestyle products, offering top brands to customers across India., Fulfillment\\nServices, Marketplace Growth, E-commerce Fulfillment Center, Two-Day Shipping, Flipkart Myntra, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Myntra now provides access to more than 6,000 brands on its marketplace. Moving to advertising. Our global advertising business delivered strong growth of approximately 35%. In the U.S., Walmart Connect sales increased 36% in Q2, and the business has nearly doubled in size over the past two years., Myntra\\nMarketplace, Brand Access, Advertising Business, Walmart Connect Sales, Global Advertising Growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re seeing strong growth in sponsored ads and increased demand for in-store activation. Advertiser count grew 60% with strong momentum in new advertisers. Sam\\'s advertising business grew 33%. The in-club sales attribution feature for search and sponsored ads has generated strong interest from advertisers., Sponsored\\nAds, In-Store Activation, Advertiser Count, Sam\\'s Advertising Business, In-Club Sales Attribution\\nFeature, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, On average, advertisers are seeing a nearly 30% improvement on the returns of digital ad spend as they gain full visibility to the member journey from intent to purchase, both online and in-clubs. And in international, the advertising business grew nearly 40%. And lastly, membership. Sam\\'s Club U.S., Digital Ad Spend,\\nMember Journey, Advertising Business Growth, International Advertising, Membership, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, member counts increased mid-single digits, with strong plus membership growth in renewals, as plus penetration is up 1.3 percentage points versus last year. During the quarter, we achieved record member acquisition tied to Walmart+ Week and continue to enhance the value of the Walmart+ membership. We introduced Walmart+ Assist which provides a 50% discount off the regular membership fee for customers receiving government assistance. We also partnered with Expedia Group to launch new travel benefits for members., Member\\nCounts, Plus Membership Growth, Walmart+ Membership, Walmart+ Assist, Travel Benefits, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Turning back to the middle of the P&L. As expected, SG&A expenses were higher versus last year and deleveraged 33 basis points. This reflects higher variable pay expenses relative to last year when we were below our planned performance, tech investments, and increased store remodel costs in the U.S. Partially offsetting this, international expenses leveraged significantly on strong sales growth., SG&A Expenses,\\nDeleveraging, Variable Pay Expenses, Tech Investments, Store Remodel Costs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, As we increasingly utilize technology in our business, we\\'re pleased with the performance metrics from our newly automated distribution and fulfillment notes. Our automated e-commerce fulfillment centers are achieving efficiencies of 30% higher units per hour than nonautomated buildings. We\\'re also seeing increased productivity from the more than 15% of stores now being served by automated regional distribution centers. It\\'s early in the rollout process, but we\\'re encouraged that some of these facilities are driving operating leverage well beyond our initial expectations., Automated\\nDistribution and Fulfillment, Efficiency Metrics, Productivity Gains, Operating Leverage, Early\\nRollout Results, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Second-quarter adjusted operating income grew more than 8%, and our adjusted EPS of $1.84 was up 4%. Our plan is to grow operating income faster than sales, and our second-quarter performance achieved this despite lapping the $173 million insurance settlement that benefited International\\'s other income last year. Similar to Q1, below-the-line items were pressured by higher net interest expense, reflecting the increase in rates and noncontrolling interest due in part to stronger results from Walmex. The team continued to do a good job managing inventory, and we ended the quarter down 5%, including an 8% decline in Walmart U.S., Adjusted\\nOperating Income, Adjusted EPS, Sales Growth, Below-the-Line Items, Inventory Management, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, We feel good about the progress we\\'ve made on in-stock levels as supply chain has normalized, and the composition of our inventory mix has improved. We\\'re maintaining discipline in how we\\'re buying general merchandise during this uncertain macro environment to mitigate future risk if demand softens. ROI, or return on investment, declined 100 basis points. As a reminder, we calculate ROI on a trailing 12-month basis., Inventory Levels,\\nSupply Chain Normalization, Inventory Mix Improvement, Macro Environment Uncertainty, ROI Decline, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, And the decline in Q2 is a result of nearly $4.2 billion in charges we incurred in Q3 and Q4 last year related primarily to the opioid legal settlement framework and the separation of Flipkart and PhonePe. Together, these negatively impacted second-quarter ROI by 140 basis points. As we lap these discrete charges in the coming quarters, we expect a stronger ROI inflection in the back half of the year. We\\'re also starting to realize some benefits from productivity initiatives that were initially planned for fiscal year \\'25, and we continue to expect our ROI to increase over the coming years., Opioid\\nLegal Settlement, Separation of Flipkart and PhonePe, Discrete Charges, Productivity Initiatives,\\nROI Inflection, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll now briefly discuss some additional Q2 highlights for each segment. For Walmart U.S., our 6.4% sales growth included a high single-digit increase in grocery and a high teens increase in health and wellness. Although general merchandise sales declined low single digits versus last year, these results were 300 basis points better than Q1, aided by outperformance from early back-to-school shopping in our Walmart+ savings event. We saw a 240 basis point shift in sales mix from general merchandise to grocery and health and wellness in Q2., Walmart\\nU.S. Sales Growth, Grocery Sales, Health and Wellness Sales, General Merchandise Sales, Sales Mix\\nShift, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Grocery inflation moderated more than 400 basis points from Q1 levels and more than 700 basis points year over year to a high single-digit increase as we lapped higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack, grocery inflation remained over 20%. We\\'re encouraged by the growth in units sold, particularly in food categories where disinflation is more pronounced, such as fresh meats, seafood, and eggs. In addition, private brand sales in grocery were up more than 9%, with penetration up nearly 40 basis points in Q2 and up more than 170 basis points on a two-year stack., Grocery\\nInflation, Moderation, Two-Year Stack, Private Brand Sales, Penetration, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Lower markdowns and supply chain costs resulted in a gross margin rate increase of 40 basis points despite ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. The negative impact to margin mix from outsized growth in branded drugs accelerated in Q2. Other income grew nearly 4%, led by continued growth in Walmart+ memberships. And overall, Walmart U.S., Gross Margin\\nRate, Category Mix Shifts, Branded Drugs Growth, Other Income Growth, Walmart+ Memberships, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, operating income increased 7.6%. Our international segment delivered another impressive quarter with double-digit sales growth and strong underlying profit growth. Operating income increased 2.2% but was negatively impacted by 20 percentage points from lapping last year\\'s insurance recovery that I mentioned earlier. Walmex had another strong quarter with sales up 10%, reflecting strength in our Bodega stores, Sam\\'s Club and e-commerce., International Sales Growth, Operating Income, Insurance Recovery, Walmex Sales, Bodega Stores, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, E-commerce sales grew in the low 20s with traffic up more than 5%. Walmex is an excellent example of our omnichannel retail strength across formats and channels. Bodega Aurrera is celebrating its 65th anniversary and has become the most valuable retail brand in Mexico. These Bodega stores have consistently delivered strong performance and continue to accelerate e-commerce to better serve customers, now offering more than 60,000 SKUs from 586 stores in 299 cities., E-commerce\\nSales Growth, Omnichannel Retail Strength, Bodega Stores, Walmex Sales, SKUs Offered, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, In China, sales increased 22%, led by strength from Sam\\'s Club and e-commerce. We\\'re executing well with increased online and offline traffic across both the Sam\\'s and hypermarket formats. In India, Flipkart delivered strong GMV and net sales growth as the core business continues to perform well. The team continues to focus on expanding the ecosystem of products and services like advertising, travel, and healthcare and on delivering continued contribution profit improvement., China Sales\\nGrowth, Sam\\'s Club Sales, E-commerce Traffic, India GMV Growth, Flipkart Core Business Performance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Flipkart\\'s consistent progress and performance reinforces our confidence in the long-term value of this business. India is leading the largest digital transformation in the world, and Flipkart is the leading marketplace in India. And we continue to be super impressed with PhonePe\\'s strong and consistent performance. Annualized TPV, or total payment volume, has surpassed $1.15 trillion., Flipkart\\nPerformance, India Digital Transformation, PhonePe Strong Performance, TPV Growth, Long-term Value, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, And for the first time, we processed more than 5 billion transactions in a single month. Sam\\'s Club delivered another strong quarter with solid unit growth in e-commerce, up 18%. It\\'s encouraging to see members embrace omnichannel with strong in-club traffic gains and increasing engagement with our digital tools in and outside the club. In Q2, utilization of Scan & Go increased 570 basis points, and curbside pickup saw double-digit growth., Transaction\\nProcessing, Sam\\'s Club Quarterly Performance, Omnichannel Traffic, Scan & Go Utilization, Curbside\\nPickup Growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Similar to Walmart, sales strength at Sam\\'s was led by grocery and healthcare categories as the members focus on value and essentials. While discretionary categories were pressured overall, items with compelling price and quality and strong value to market are driving sales. Sam\\'s Club operating income was up 22%, due in part to lower LIFO charges. Turning to guidance., Grocery\\nSales Strength, Healthcare Categories, Discretionary Categories Pressure, Sam\\'s Club Operating\\nIncome, LIFO Charges, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, There continues to be a reasonable level of uncertainty in the economic backdrop for the balance of this year. While inflation has moderated and employment levels have been steady, credit markets have tightened, energy prices are higher, and some customers face additional expense from the resumption of student loan payments in October. As such, we continue to be appropriately measured in our outlook. We\\'re raising our full-year guidance to reflect Q2 performance and our expectations for Q3., Economic\\nUncertainty, Inflation Moderation, Employment Levels, Credit Markets Tightening, Student Loan\\nPayments Resumption, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll highlight the key changes, but please refer to the press release for a full list of updated metrics. For the full year, we now expect net sales in constant currency to grow approximately 4% to 4.5%. We now anticipate LIFO will be a $200 million charge to operating income versus the $500 million charge that was in our prior guide. We expect operating income in constant currency to increase approximately 7% to 7.5%., Net Sales\\nGrowth, LIFO Charge, Operating Income Growth, Full-Year Guidance, Press Release Metrics, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, This now assumes a 30 basis point year-over-year tailwind from LIFO, compared to our prior guidance, which assumed a 100 basis point headwind. And we estimate adjusted EPS to be in a range of $6.36 to $6.46, including an expected $0.05 impact from LIFO. To bridge to our prior guide, we flowed through the Q2 beat, removed the Walmart U.S. LIFO charges that were previously expected in Q3 and Q4, and modestly raised our sales expectations., LIFO Impact,\\nAdjusted EPS Guidance, Sales Expectations, Q2 Beat, Walmart U.S. LIFO Charges, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, Looking at Q3, we\\'re now offering the following view. We expect net sales growth in constant currency of approximately 3%. Operating income growth in constant currency is expected to be approximately 1%. This year-over-year growth is impacted by several comparison factors., Net Sales\\nGrowth, Operating Income Growth, Comparison Factors, Q3 Guidance, Year-Over-Year Growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, We expect ongoing mix pressure impacts to gross margin to continue in Q3. We also expect a negative impact from fuel margins at Sam\\'s Club versus last year\\'s elevated levels. And similar to Q2, variable pay expense is expected to be higher in Q3 versus last year when we were below our planned performance. We don\\'t typically guide currency, but it\\'s worth noting that if rates stayed where they are currently, we\\'d see a $1.6 billion benefit to Q3 reported sales and reported operating income growth would be closer to 3.5%., Gross\\nMargin Pressure, Fuel Margins Impact, Variable Pay Expense, Currency Impact, Q3 Guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, And lastly, we expect Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.45 to $1.50. In closing, we\\'re pleased with the strong first half of the year, and we positioned the business favorably for the back half. Our financial performance is validating our omnichannel strategy, driving organic sales growth while improving margins and returns. We\\'re optimistic about our ability to improve our performance even more in the future., Strong\\nFirst Half, Omnichannel Strategy, Financial Performance, Q3 Adjusted EPS Guidance, Future\\nPerformance Optimism, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 2, John David Rainey, Chief Financial Officer, We like our position. And now, I\\'ll hand it back to Doug for a few comments before the operator opens the line for questions., Position,\\nComments, Operator Opening Line for Questions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We\\'re excited to discuss the results of a strong first quarter and our upwardly revised outlook for the year. Joining me on the call are Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and CFO John David Rainey. Following prepared remarks from Doug and John David, we\\'ll take your questions., Strong\\nFirst Quarter, Upwardly Revised Outlook, Prepared Remarks, Questions, Walmart CEO and CFO, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, At that time, we will be joined by our segment CEOs: John Furner from Walmart U.S., Judith McKenna from Walmart International, and Kath McLay from Sam\\'s Club. In order to address as many of your questions as we can in the time allotted for this call, please limit yourself to one question. The operator will mute your line after your question has been posed. After management has responded, we will move to the next person in line., Segment\\nCEOs, John Furner, Judith McKenna, Kath McLay, Question Limit, Operator Muting Lines, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Today\\'s call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com., Forward-\\nLooking Statements, Risk Factors, Cautionary Statement, Safe Harbor Statement, Non-GAAP\\nReconciliations, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Doug, we are now ready to begin. , Thank You,\\nInterest in Walmart, Beginning, Doug, Ready, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss our Q1 results. We had a strong first quarter. Sales growth was strong globally, including growth of 26% in e-commerce. Profit grew much faster than sales, and we made further progress on inventory levels., Strong\\nFirst Quarter, Sales Growth, E-commerce Growth, Profit Growth, Inventory Levels, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, The omnichannel model we\\'re building continues to resonate with customers and members. As expected, a higher mix of sales in the food and consumables categories negatively affected gross profit, but strong expense management and progress with our newer, mutually reinforcing businesses helped us grow profit ahead of sales at 17.3%. The business model we outlined at our recent investor conference is taking shape. International had a great quarter, continuing our momentum from last year., Omnichannel\\nModel, Customer Resonance, Gross Profit, Expense Management, International Momentum, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Sales grew 12.9% in constant currency, and profit grew even faster at 41%. China, Walmex, and Flipkart all saw double-digit top-line growth. In China, the reopening of the economy coincided with the Chinese New Year season, and that drove traffic to our clubs and stores. Sam\\'s Club China continues its strong performance., Sales\\nGrowth, Profit Growth, Double-Digit Top-Line Growth, Chinese New Year, Sam\\'s Club China, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, For India, a group of us were there last week and we left even more excited about our opportunities. Flipkart and PhonePe are doing well. Our Walmart tech team there is strong, and we have a big opportunity to increase our exports from India across quite a few merchandise categories. In the U.S., both Walmart and Sam\\'s Club performed well with good transaction growth, positive units in food, and strong e-commerce growth., India\\nOpportunities, Flipkart, PhonePe, Walmart Tech Team, Exports from India, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We continue to gain market share in the grocery category, including with higher income and younger shoppers, and we saw good growth in membership income in both businesses. At Sam\\'s Club U.S., member count and Plus member penetration hit all-time highs in the quarter. Our growth is now being driven by convenience in addition to price. We see it across formats and income and age cohorts., Grocery\\nCategory, Market Share, Membership Income, Convenience, Format, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, In terms of inventory, we\\'re in good shape, and stock is improving and excess inventory keeps coming down. We see it in the numbers and I\\'m seeing it on store and club visits. Globally, customers continue to seek value given the impact of inflation. We see it in the U.S., Inventory,\\nStock Improvement, Excess Inventory, Value Seeking Customers, Inflation Impact, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, and in other markets like Mexico, Canada, and Chile. Private brand penetration is up about 110 basis points versus last year for Walmart U.S. and 50 basis points for Walmex. We continue to manage our price gaps and deliver value for our customers., Private Brand\\nPenetration, Price Gaps, Value for Customers, Mexico, Canada, Chile, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, In Walmart U.S., general merchandise costs are now lower than a year ago, which is great, but they\\'re still higher than two years ago on like items. In the dry grocery and consumables categories like paper goods, we continue to see high single-digit to low double-digit cost inflation. We all need those prices to come down. The persistently high rates of inflation in these categories lasting for such a long period of time are weighing on some of the families we serve., Cost\\nInflation, General Merchandise Costs, Dry Grocery Categories, Consumables Categories, Price\\nReduction, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, This stubborn inflation in dry grocery and consumables is one of the key factors creating uncertainty for us in the back half of the year because of the cumulative impact on discretionary spending and other categories, specifically general merchandise. We think we\\'ve got guidance where it should be, reflecting the appropriate amount of conservatism given the external environment. We feel very good about our performance, our multiyear momentum, and our ability to serve people however they want to shop and do it at a value. We\\'re executing well and performing well in all three segments., Inflation\\nImpact, Discretionary Spending, Guidance, Performance, Execution, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, John David will say more about how we\\'re thinking about guidance in a minute. As we look ahead to Q2 and the rest of the year, we\\'re focused on getting our merchandise costs and retails down to fight inflation for our customers and members, which will help us with mix, pickup, and delivery execution, whether that comes from a store or an FC, expense management, and inventory management by item category. There are places to play offense and there are places to be more conservative. We shouldn\\'t be treating every category the same way and we aren\\'t., Merchandise\\nCosts, Retail Prices, Inflation Fighting, Mix, Pickup and Delivery Execution, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re playing offense where we should and controlling what we can control. Last month, we hosted our investor meeting in Florida where we visited a DC, a store, and a Sam\\'s Club. For those of you that made that trip, thank you. We really enjoyed it and hope you did too., Investor\\nMeeting, Florida, DC Visit, Store Visit, Sam\\'s Club Visit, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We had three takeaways. First, we\\'re positioned to grow because we can serve customers and members however they want to be served. Second, over time, we expect to grow profit faster than sales and improve operating margin due to productivity improvements and the mix of businesses. And third, we\\'ll be disciplined with capital to improve ROI as we grow operating income., Growth, Customer\\nService, Productivity Improvements, Capital Discipline, Operating Margin, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, I hope you can see how the investments we\\'ve made in recent years are driving results. We added nearly $11 billion in sales in Q1, delivered 58 basis points of expense leverage, and expanded operating margin by 34 basis points. As for returns, we want operating profit growing faster than sales, and we expect to see an inflection in ROI in the coming quarters as we begin to lap large, one-time items from past quarters. The investor meeting also gave us an opportunity to show off a piece of the automation we\\'re working on in an ambient DC., Investments, Sales Growth, Expense Leverage, Operating Margin, ROI Inflection, Automation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, And while it\\'s an important piece of what we\\'re building, our overall set of capabilities go far beyond that. We\\'re building a more connected, intelligent, and automated network. We\\'re adding market fulfillment centers, or MFCs, which utilize automated storage and retrieval systems, and we expect to add thousands of electric vehicles to support our last-mile delivery capabilities. It\\'s about creating a supply chain that\\'s better, not just bigger., Supply\\nChain, Automation, Electric Vehicles, Last-Mile Delivery, Market Fulfillment Centers, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re excited about how our new capabilities will help our associates by making some of our more physically demanding jobs into more rewarding higher-skilled career paths. We\\'re hosting our annual Shareholders\\' Week events in a couple of weeks here in northwest Arkansas. Part of the experience will include a tour of an MFC we\\'ve just opened. It\\'ll be a good chance to see another piece of what we\\'re building., Career\\nPaths, Associates, Shareholders\\' Week, MFC Tours, Northwest Arkansas, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, I\\'ll close by saying thank you. Thank you to our associates for helping us deliver another strong quarter. We\\'re proud of them and pleased that both Walmart and Sam\\'s Club in the U.S. were recently certified as a great place to work by the industry leader in workplace excellence., Associates,\\nWorkplace Excellence, Great Place to Work, U.S. Certification, Industry Leader, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Thank you for your interest in our company. Now over to John David., Interest,\\nCompany, John David, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Doug. I\\'d like to start by thanking our customers, associates, and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter to start the year. Despite a challenging macro environment, the team executed and we made progress advancing our various strategic initiatives. I\\'ll begin by reviewing highlights for the quarter using the framework of growth, margins, and returns., Growth,\\nMargins, Returns, Strategic Initiatives, Customers, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Then I\\'ll spend a couple of minutes reviewing key themes from a recent Investor Day before detailing our updated guidance. Starting with growth. For the first quarter, constant-currency sales increased nearly 8%, or about $11 billion, with strength across all segments. Walmart U.S., Growth,\\nSales, Segments, Investor Day, Guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 7.4%, including 27% growth in e-commerce. After a strong start, sales growth moderated as the quarter progressed. The 90-basis-point deceleration in comp sales growth from Q4 was driven by pricing and the effect of lapping higher inflation rates in the prior-year period. We continue to gain share and grow unit volume and grocery., Comps\\nSales, E-commerce, Inflation Rates, Share Gain, Unit Volume, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, This was consistent with our expectations and how we built our plan. At the headline level, consumer spending has proven resilient, but below the surface, we continue to see signs that customers remain choiceful, particularly in discretionary categories. In Q1, we saw nearly 360-basis-point shift in U.S. sales mix from general merchandise to grocery and health and wellness., Resilience,\\nCustomer Choicefulness, Sales Mix, Discretionary Categories, Grocery and Health and Wellness, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, To benchmark, the magnitude of this shift exceeds to 330 basis points of category mix shift we experienced in all of last year. In addition to the persistence of inflation in food and consumables, customers were also impacted by a reduction of SNAP benefits and lower tax refunds. These impacts were partially offset by higher spending tied to an increase in the cost of living adjustment for Social Security benefits. In our international segment, sales were strong, up nearly 13% on a constant-currency basis, led by double-digit growth in China, Walmex, and Flipkart., Inflation,\\nCustomer Impact, Sales Mix, International Segment, Cost of Living Adjustment, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Many of the same impacts on consumer spending in the U.S. affected our international markets too. In Sam\\'s Club, U.S. comp sales increased 7% with member fee income up 6.3%., Consumer\\nSpending, International Markets, Sam\\'s Club, Member Fee Income, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Average spend per member increased mid-single digits. Now on margins. Consolidated gross margins decreased 18 basis points with ongoing pressure from category sales mix globally. This headwind was partially offset by a reduction in supply chain and freight costs relative to last year\\'s heightened levels., Gross Margins, Supply Chain Costs, Freight Costs, Consolidated Gross Margins, Average\\nSpend Per Member, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Category mix was a notable headwind across geographies and formats. Walmart U.S. general merchandise sales declined mid-single digits, while food and consumable sales increased low double digits. Headline inflation in food and consumables came down over 400 basis points from the start of Q1 to the end of the quarter, but prices remain high and customers are being cautious with their spend in discretionary categories., Category\\nMix, General Merchandise Sales, Food and Consumable Sales, Inflation Rates, Customer Caution, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And while we make attractive margins in food and consumables, they have a lower margin than general merchandise. We expect category mix to remain a gross margin headwind for the balance of FY \\'24. The higher margin initiatives that are connected to our core omni-retail business, including marketplace, advertising, and membership, continue to meaningfully outgrow the base. I\\'ll discuss each of these., Margins, Category\\nMix, Omni-Retail Business, Advertising, Membership, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, First, marketplace and fulfillment services. We\\'re growing our marketplace with new items and sellers and an improved experience. We\\'ve increased seller counts in the U.S. by more than 40% year over year, and the number using Walmart fulfillment services has more than doubled., Marketplace\\nGrowth, Seller Counts, Fulfillment Services, Improved Experience, New Items, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re adding higher-profile, in-demand brands that our customers are searching for but not typically distributed at Walmart, elevating our profile as a digital shopping destination. And in India, Flipkart\\'s e-commerce platform continues to scale, growing first-time e-commerce customers and expanding its reach in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Flipkart\\'s eKart business now includes more than 35,000 Kirana partners, as well as providing fulfillment services for Flipkart sellers and other third parties. Moving to advertising., Digital\\nShopping Destination, E-commerce Growth, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Cities, Advertising, Fulfillment\\nServices, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Our global advertising business delivered strong growth of over 30% in Q1. In the U.S., Walmart Connect advertising sales increased nearly 40% as we experience strong momentum and new advertisers, particularly from marketplace sellers, and the number of 3P\\xa0sellers utilizing our ad capabilities has doubled over the past 12 months. Sam\\'s Club ad business called Member Access Platform grew double digits with the number of active advertisers up more than 50% versus last year. Advertisers are responding to our recently launched in-club sales attribution feature, which provides advertisers with clear insights on the returns of digital ad spend both online and in clubs while enhancing member experience., Advertising\\nGrowth, Walmart Connect, Marketplace Sellers, Member Access Platform, In-Club Sales Attribution, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And in international, the advertising business continued to show strength, led by Flipkart ads which was up over 50%. And lastly, membership. Sam\\'s Club member accounts have had a multiyear run of robust growth with another record high achieved in Q1. Member counts have grown nearly 30% over the past three years, and we\\'re increasingly attracting greater numbers of millennials and Gen Z., Advertising\\nBusiness, Flipkart Ads, Membership Growth, Member Counts, Millennials and Gen Z, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We also like the trends we\\'re seeing from Walmart+ members. Nearly 50% of our Walmart+ members are coming from the online pickup and delivery channel. Members spend more than nonmembers. They shop with us more frequently., Walmart+ Members,\\nOnline Pickup and Delivery Channel, Spending Habits, Frequency of Shopping, Member Demographics, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And the membership deepens engagement, helps enable personalization, and allows us to offer more services and to provide more offers on things that are important to our customers. Turning back to the middle of the P&L. SG&A expenses leveraged 58 basis points, aided by strong sales growth across the enterprise, a continued focus on managing costs into moderating sales growth as inflation lessens, and lapping some COVID-related wage costs in the U.S. last year., Membership\\nDeepens Engagement, Personalization, Sales Growth, SG&A Expenses, Inflation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Taking all this together, our operating income grew more than 17%. This is relative to sales growth of nearly 8%, which resulted in operating margin expansion of 34 basis points, reinforcing the financial framework that we laid out at our Investor Day. As signaled when we issued FY \\'24 guidance in February, several below-the-line items impacted our Q1 earnings results, including higher net interest expense. Q1 net interest expense was more than $550 million, and we issued $5 billion of debt at favorable rates., Operating\\nIncome Growth, Sales Growth, Operating Margin Expansion, Net Interest Expense, Debt Issuance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Noncontrolling interest was also higher in the quarter due in part to stronger results from Walmex. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was better than we expected as sales outpaced our plan and cost leverage exceeded plan. GAAP EPS was $0.62. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects an $0.85 impact from unrealized gains and losses on equity investments., Stronger\\nResults, Walmex, Adjusted EPS, GAAP EPS, Unrealized Gains and Losses on Equity Investments, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, The team continued to do a good job managing inventory, and we ended the quarter down 7%, including a more than 9% decline in Walmart U.S. Managing costs and inventory are two of the key controllables as we navigate an uncertain macro environment. We\\'re improving inventory efficiency and merchandise flow and addressing placement in order to better serve customers, improve store in-stock levels, while also mitigating future risks if demand softens. Let me take a moment to discuss our returns, or specifically, return on investment, or ROI, which declined by 120 basis points this quarter., Inventory\\nManagement, Macro Environment, Cost Control, Inventory Efficiency, Merchandise Flow, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We calculate ROI on a trailing 12-month basis. As such, the decline in Q1 is a result of nearly 4.2 billion in charges we incurred in Q3 and Q4 last year related primarily to the opioid legal settlement framework and the separation of Flipkart and PhonePe. Together, these negatively impacted the first-quarter ROI by about 140 basis points. These will again be a headwind in Q2 and, to a lesser extent, in Q3., ROI,\\ncharges, settlement framework, separation, Flipkart, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, As we lap these charges, we expect meaningful improvement in ROI in the back half of this year. When you look beyond these unique items, our underlying operational ROI is steadily moving higher. At our Investor Day in April, I said that we want our ROI to go up every year, and I still believe that will be the case this year. Let me briefly reference key segment highlights for Q1., ROI,\\ncharges, improvement, operational ROI, Investor Day, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, For Walmart U.S., comp sales were strong, up 7.4%, reflecting higher store traffic trends as well as strong growth in store-fulfilled pickup and delivery. From a category perspective, comp sales were driven by strong growth in food and health and wellness, partially offset by a decline in general merchandise sales. Unseasonably cooler spring weather negatively impacted sales in certain seasonal hardline categories, including lawn and garden. Gross margins decreased 41 basis points, primarily due to ongoing pressure from category mix shifts., comp sales, store\\ntraffic, category perspective, gross margins, seasonal hardline categories, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, As mentioned previously, supply chain costs and transportation were lower as we lapped last year\\'s elevated levels. Inflation remained high, up low double digits in food categories. It\\'s important to remember that while, year over year, inflation started to moderate as the quarter progressed, this is largely due to lapping higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack basis, food inflation remains over 2% and continues to pressure discretionary wallets., supply chain costs,\\ntransportation, inflation, food categories, two-year stack basis, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Share gains in grocery continued, including from higher-income households, as our strong price gaps resonate with customers who are increasingly prioritizing value and convenience. We\\'re also seeing market share gains in the areas of general merchandise where we\\'ve invested to improve the customer experience such as entertainment and automotive. In this environment, as customers manage household budgets more tightly and are biasing spending toward everyday essentials, we\\'re reinforcing our value proposition across the merchandise offering, including seasonal event savings featuring high-quality owned brands and leaning into opening price points. For the Easter holiday, we offered customers a curated Easter meal along with a traditional Easter basket for the same price as last year., grocery, share gains,\\ngeneral merchandise, customer experience, seasonal event savings, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Private brand penetration and grocery categories increased nearly 110 basis points in Q1 following a 160-basis-point increase in Q4 and 130-basis-point increase in Q3. E-commerce sales were led by continued double-digit growth in store-fulfilled pickup and delivery. Customers increasingly value convenience and speed of delivery. We have an advantage here as we leverage the proximity of our stores to fulfill and deliver digital orders to customer homes., private brand\\npenetration, grocery categories, e-commerce sales, convenience, delivery speed, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In many cases, we can get orders delivered faster to customers while building a sustainable omni-economic model. Strong flow-through on higher sales contributed to SG&A expense leverage, which offset gross profit pressure, resulting in strong operating income growth of 11.7% relative to comp sales growth of 7.4%. Our international segment delivered an outstanding quarter with strong growth in both sales and profit, continuing the momentum built in the back half of last year. International group, both the top and the bottom line, faster than the enterprise., omni-economic model,\\nSG&A expense leverage, gross profit pressure, international segment, international momentum, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Sales grew nearly 13% on a constant-currency basis, led by double-digit growth in China, Walmex, and Flipkart. Impressively, operating income grew more than three times faster than sales, up 41%, with each market delivering year-over-year improvement. The strong profit flow-through is particularly encouraging as the team has been delivering operating efficiencies on top of strong sales growth. In China, sales increased 28% as the team executed well during the Chinese New Year season and also saw increased traffic as the Chinese economy reopens., sales growth, operating\\nincome growth, profit flow-through, China, Walmex, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Results were strong across formats and channels with continued member growth and higher member retention at Sam\\'s Club, improved trends in hypermarkets, and more than 50% sales growth in e-commerce. Walmex had another good quarter with sales strength in Bodega stores, Sam\\'s Clubs, and e-commerce. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to expand our physical footprint, opening more than 120 stores over the past 12 months while also scaling our omnichannel capabilities. As customers\\' desire for convenience increases, the team has rolled out a 60-minute delivery option to 80% of Walmart Supercenter and Express stores in Mexico., member growth, sales\\ngrowth, e-commerce, omnichannel capabilities, convenience, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In India, Flipkart had strong top-line results and improved its contribution profit. The team continues to expand their products and services. As an example, Flipkart Travel added to its portfolio of offerings by launching bus reservation services during the quarter through its Cleartrip platform and already is capable of offering 1 million bus connections to customers. And we continue to be pleased with PhonePe\\'s great performance., India, Flipkart,\\ncontribution profit, products and services, bus reservation services, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, During the quarter, we reached an important milestone with annualized total payment volume, or TPV, eclipsing the 1 trillion level for the first time. For Sam\\'s Club, U.S. comp sales were strong, up 7% in Q1. In addition to solid increases in both transaction and ticket, Sam\\'s e-commerce sales were up 19%, led by strong growth in curbside., TPV, Sam\\'s Club, U.S. comp sales, e-commerce sales, curbside, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Sam\\'s delivered another quarter of record member counts, and membership income growth was 6.3%. Plus member penetration also hit an all-time high during the quarter. And it was terrific to celebrate the 40th birthday of Sam\\'s Club during the quarter with member promotions and events. We saw incredible response from our existing and new members, including the largest quarterly membership signup on record., Sam\\'s Club, member\\ncounts, membership income growth, plus member penetration, member promotions and events, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Operating income declined slightly as a result of an inflation-related LIFO charge of $48 million. Without that charge, operating income would have increased 10%. At our investment community meeting in April, I outlined our plan to grow operating income faster than sales centered on three strategic building blocks of our financial objectives. First, we\\'re focused on driving organic sales growth from our omnichannel business model., LIFO charge, operating\\nincome growth, omnichannel business model, financial objectives, investment community meeting, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, It\\'s clear our omni model is resonating with customers across income demographics who are seeking out Walmart digitally and in stores, curbside, and via delivery. And we\\'re growing mindshare for our convenience, which nearly matches our mindshare for price. As we continue to scale digital capabilities in our markets around the world, we have an opportunity to drive significant growth in the top line over the coming years. The second component of our financial model is to diversify our earning streams through improved product and business mix., omnichannel,\\nconvenience, digital capabilities, product and business mix, earnings streams, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, To improve product mix, we\\'re focused on increasing sales penetration in higher-margin categories, like apparel and home, through the expansion of our e-commerce marketplace assortment and an upgraded presentation and experience in our remodeled stores. Our e-commerce assortment has grown to include over 200 million SKUs in apparel and nearly 60 million in home categories. And our newest remodeled supercenters take a differentiated approach to showcasing general merchandise with more brand shops, digital displays, mannequins, wider aisles, and updated fixtures. We\\'re very encouraged by the early reads on customer response to these initiatives, and we plan to update 300 stores with these features this year., product mix, e-commerce\\nmarketplace assortment, remodeled stores, customer response, initiatives, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we\\'re making progress in improving our business mix as we scale our portfolio of highly attractive growth initiatives that reinforce our core retail model and will directly reshape our e-commerce and enterprise profit trajectory. This set of initiatives drive stronger returns and includes advertising data and membership in many markets. Collectively, these initiatives generate operating margins that are appreciably higher than our core business and we expect will begin to positively influence operating profit growth relative to sales growth this year. The third building block of the model includes improving returns by scaling proven high-return investments in our supply chain that drive operating leverage and improve incremental margins., business mix, growth\\ninitiatives, advertising data, membership, supply chain, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re investing capital to optimize our distribution and fulfillment nodes with automation that we expect will drive a significant improvement in unit economics in the coming years. Our capital structure and cash flow generation are an advantage, and we\\'re allocating capital responsibly with a bias toward increasing returns. I\\'ll reiterate what I said at our Investor Day. We like our strategic position., distribution and\\nfulfillment nodes, automation, unit economics, capital structure, cash flow generation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Over time, we expect revenue growth across a diversified set of drivers, improved category mix, and increasingly accretive business mix, coupled with improved unit economics. This is all fueled by supply chain investments with attractive payback cycles. We expect the outcome will be operating income growing faster than sales. Turning to guidance., revenue growth,\\ncategory mix, business mix, supply chain investments, operating income, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty looking out over the balance of this year as macro pressures on the consumer have gradually intensified. As such, we continue to maintain a prudent approach to our outlook while, at the same time, having a high level of confidence in what we can control. It\\'s also not our historic practice to always update guidance exiting Q1, and we don\\'t necessarily want to establish precedent. But we think, in this unique environment, it\\'s important to provide an ongoing framework as our views evolve., uncertainty, macro\\npressures, consumer confidence, guidance, historic practice, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re raising our full-year guidance to reflect Q1 performance and our expectations for Q2. We now expect net sales in constant currency to grow approximately 3.5%. Our expectations are for Walmart U.S. and international to grow slightly faster than our prior view and for Sam\\'s Club growth to be consistent with our February guidance., full-year guidance, Q1\\nperformance, net sales, constant currency, growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We expect operating income in constant currency to increase approximately 4% to 4.5%, including an expected 100-basis-point impact from LIFO charges. And we estimate adjusted EPS to be in a range of $6.10 to $6.20, including an expected $0.14 impact from LIFO. There are also a few changes below the line. Our recent debt issuance yielded a more favorable interest rate than estimated, and as such, our net interest expense is expected to grow $600 million versus last year., operating income,\\nconstant currency, LIFO charges, adjusted EPS, net interest expense, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, NCI, or non-controlling interests, is expected to be closer to a $0.20 drag to EPS year over year, including strength in Walmex. And our tax expectations have moved toward the upper end of our prior range at approximately 26.5%. Looking at Q2, we\\'re offering the following view. Net sales growth in constant currency of approximately 4%., NCI, non-controlling\\ninterests, EPS, tax expectations, Q2, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Operating income in constant currency is expected to decline approximately 2% versus last year. Excluding the $173 million benefit from Walmart Chile insurance proceeds last year, operating income growth in constant currency is expected to be flat to up slightly. As you compare EPS versus the prior year, we\\'re lapping the $0.05 benefit from Chile insurance proceeds and other income and $0.05 from JD\\'s dividend and other gains and losses, resulting in a total of $0.10 of comparable EPS headwinds. We expect adjusted EPS of $1.63 to $1.68 in Q2 this year., operating income,\\nconstant currency, EPS, comparable EPS headwinds, adjusted EPS, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In closing, the year is off to a good start. We\\'re positioning our business to succeed with an expanding omni ecosystem that allows us to grow our top and bottom line throughout any economic environment. If the consumer environment tightens further, we have a compelling value proposition with everyday low prices and a suite of conveniences to continue to gain wallet share. If the macro environment improves, we have the opportunity to sell more general merchandise and improve our margin mix through both our first-party stores and e-commerce and third-party marketplace businesses., good start, omni\\necosystem, consumer environment, macro environment, value proposition, Walmart\\nWMT, 2024, 1, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And the transformation of our business mix toward higher-margin streams of value is underway, helping to protect our profits today and to drive better profit growth in the future. I look forward to seeing many of you at our shareholders\\' meeting activities next month here in northwest Arkansas. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions., business mix, margin\\ngrowth, profit protection, shareholders\\' meeting, northwest Arkansas, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you, and welcome to our Q4 fiscal \\'23 earnings conference call.

We\\'re excited about our momentum. The team delivered a strong finish to the year. And as a result, in the last two quarters show, we acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year., momentum, team, strong\\nfinish, inventory challenges, cost challenges, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We built momentum in the third quarter, and that continues. We\\'re well positioned to start this fiscal year. For fiscal \\'23, we added $38 billion in sales globally, and we crossed 600 billion in revenue for the first time in our company\\'s history.

Around the world, the teams leaned into our food and consumable strength, taking share in places like the U.S. and Canada, and delivered a good experience for customers and members in general merchandise. They drove sales and landed the seasons in a very good inventory position when it was all said and done., food and consumable strength, team performance, customer experience, inventory position, seasonal\\nsales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year, which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number. And they did it while improving in-stock levels. I\\'m impressed with how they brought it all together and want to highlight our store, club, and supply chain associates who handled a lot of volume to make this happen. As we navigated the short term, we also advanced our strategic priorities., inventory levels, in-\\nstock levels, store associates, supply chain associates, strategic priorities, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Big picture, our strategy is simple. It\\'s to bring our purpose to life for those we have the privilege to serve. We\\'re a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer that\\'s dedicated to helping people save money and live a better life. That\\'s who we are., people-led, tech-\\npowered, omnichannel retailer, saving money, living better, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Why do we exist? It\\'s to help people save money and live better. How do we do it? By being people-led with clear values, a unique culture, and tech-powered. We\\'re a people business, focused on customers, members, and associates. We\\'re constantly adjusting to put the right combination of wages, benefits, and education in place so that our people can build lifelong careers and achieve their full potential., people-led, tech-\\npowered, customer focus, wages, benefits, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, You can start your career assembling bicycles and end up leading all of our U.S. stores. You can start as a cashier and become a truck driver. You can start unloading trucks in a DC and grow to oversee an automated system moving freight through that DC., career growth, job\\nopportunities, leadership development, employee advancement, supply chain management, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We provide opportunity, even as we continue to innovate through technology and prepare our business and workforce for the future. One of the things I\\'ve always appreciated about this company is that it\\'s naturally hedged. If customers want more of something and less of something else, we shift our inventory. If the economy is strong, our customers have more money., inventory management,\\ncustomer demand, economic conditions, workforce development, business innovation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, And that\\'s great. If things are tougher, they come to us for value. With today\\'s inflation, we\\'re continuing to see that happen. We\\'re gaining share across income cohorts, including at the higher end, which made up nearly half of the gains we saw in the U.S., inflation, share gain,\\nincome cohorts, customer demand, business performance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, again this quarter. And we\\'re also capturing a greater share of wallet at Sam\\'s Club in the U.S. with both mid- and higher-income shoppers. Our goal is for the experience they\\'re having in our stores and clubs, combined with our current capabilities for pickup, delivery, and membership, to result in them choosing us even as inflation eventually subsides., inflation, share gain,\\ncustomer demand, business performance, membership, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, As we plan this new fiscal year, we\\'ve anticipated stubborn inflation in dry grocery and consumables in particular, which will have some mixed impact. We\\'ll stay focused on general merchandise and earn sales in those categories to offset that impact as much as possible. When we think about our business today compared to what it was during prior economic downturns, we now have a more compelling offer, a true omnichannel experience that makes us optimistic that more higher-income families will continue shopping with us across categories because we have pickup, delivery, and membership. And we\\'re improving in categories like apparel and home., inflation, business\\nperformance, customer demand, omnichannel experience, category growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Our recently remodeled U.S. stores have a focus in those areas, and the early response from customers is promising. We\\'re also improving our e-commerce assortment and presentation in those categories. We\\'ve always been known for great prices., store remodeling, customer\\nresponse, e-commerce, pricing strategy, category improvement, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, And because of the work we\\'ve done around pickup and delivery from stores, clubs, and expanded assortment through FCs, we\\'re increasingly known for the convenience we offer. In fact, our U.S. customer feedback showed strength in price and convenience. Our reputation for price remained strong, and our score for convenience has risen to nearly the same level., price, convenience, customer\\nfeedback, store pickup, delivery, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Our Walmart Plus members recognize our strength for convenience even more than the average customer. As it relates to our customer or member value proposition, we continue to have a strength with respect to value while we\\'re expanding choice by growing our assortment on walmart.com, and we\\'re improving as it relates to experience. Being an at-scale omnichannel retailer creates unique opportunities to innovate in the area of experience. That includes products like Scan & Go at Sam\\'s Club and a newer in-house conversational AI platform, enabling a voice-and-chat capability being used by more than 50 million customers in an average of 1 million associates across the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and Chile., value proposition, customer\\nexperience, omnichannel retail, Scan & Go, conversational AI, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re driving a lot of change in our company. We know where to tap the brakes on costs and inventory. But our focus is more on the gas pedal with respect to our strategic improvements related to assortment growth and our customer member experience. We\\'ll keep shaping the business model by scaling our newer, mutually reinforcing businesses in areas like marketplace, fulfillment services, and advertising., strategic improvements,\\ncustomer experience, business model, assortment growth, cost management, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, It\\'s exciting to see our global advertising business grow to $2.7 billion for the year we just completed. That\\'s nearly 30% growth. Over the last three years, while our front-line focus was on navigating the pandemic and inflation, we still launched and started scaling new complementary businesses using the technology and expertise we developed over time. You can see this in some of our recent announcements., advertising revenue,\\nbusiness growth, new businesses, pandemic, technology development, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, The partnership we announced with Salesforce to help scale local fulfillment and delivery solutions for customers on their e-commerce platform is a good example. Or our new Walmart business e-commerce site is another, where we\\'re helping small- and medium-sized businesses and nonprofits save money and spend less on purchasing the items they need every day. Our fast growing businesses in India, Flipkart and PhonePe, announced a full separation, which will allow both companies to focus on their own growth paths independently and help unlock value for shareholders. Flipkart has continued to strengthen its market leadership position in e-commerce and is entering this year with good momentum., partnership, local\\nfulfillment, delivery solutions, small businesses, India, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, PhonePe also announced the closing in January of the initial tranche of a fund raised that values the business at $12 billion pre-money. This is more than double the previous valuation just two years ago. And our Sam\\'s Club U.S. team announced expansion plans that will have us opening more than 30 new clubs across the country over the next several years, in addition to a multiyear plan to invest in and modernize our supply chain, especially in the U.S., fund raising, valuation,\\nexpansion plans, supply chain modernization, Sam\\'s Club, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, I\\'ll wrap up my comments today by saying thank you to our associates. I\\'m grateful for how they continue to step up for our customers and members, and I\\'m impressed by their creativity and resilience. We\\'ve worked through a lot of the operational stress in our business from last year, and we made progress on strategic initiatives as we did it. And we\\'re doing it in a way that\\'s uniquely Walmart., associates, creativity,\\nresilience, operational stress, strategic initiatives, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Doug. I\\'d like to start by thanking our customers, associates, and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter to wrap up the year. We\\'re pleased with how we finished the year. Our team demonstrated our agility and responsiveness to overcome the operational challenges, from supply chain disruptions, excess inventory, and the shift in our merchandise mix., strong quarter, operational\\nchallenges, supply chain disruptions, excess inventory, merchandise mix, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, For the full year, enterprise sales on a constant currency basis grew more than 7%, and we surpassed $600 billion in annual sales for the first time. Adjusted EPS declined 2.6% for the year. Our performance in Q4 was better than our expectations due to sales upside and good expense leverage. Constant currency sales grew 8%, with strength across all segments, including strong performance throughout the holiday season., sales growth,\\nenterprise sales, adjusted EPS, expense leverage, holiday season, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Walmart U.S. comps increased 8.3%, including 17% growth in e-commerce, with a combination of pricing due in part to inflation and share gains. Sam\\'s Club U.S. delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps, with growth of 12.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco.,  e-commerce,  inflation,  share gains,  Sam\\'s Club U.S.,  double-digit comps, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And constant currency sales at Walmart International increased 5.5%, led by Walmex. As I discuss our profitability, it\\'s important to note the reorganization and restructuring charges within the international segment affect year-over-year comparisons, so my comments regarding Q4 results will focus on the business excluding adjusted items. Gross margins were down 83 basis points, largely resulting from additional markdowns taken to address carryover inventory balances, mix headwinds, and underlying inflation and our cost structure. With strong sales growth in the quarter, we levered SG&A expenses by 89 basis points.,  Walmart\\nInternational,  profitability,  reorganization and restructuring charges,  gross margins,\\n SG&A expenses, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Taking all this together, adjusted operating income grew nearly 7%. Adjusted EPS of $1.71 was better than we expected going into the quarter. GAAP EPS was $2.32. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects a $1.16 benefit from unrealized gains on equity investments, partially offset by a $0.55 charge related to business reorganization and restructuring in international.,  adjusted operating\\nincome,  adjusted EPS,  GAAP EPS,  unrealized gains,  business reorganization and\\nrestructuring, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Inventory at quarter end was relatively flat to last year. This includes a nearly 3% decrease from Walmart U.S. I\\'m pleased with how our teams responded to the challenge early in the year to aggressively rebalance inventory for the current environment, and it sets us up in a really good position going into the year. Let me briefly reference key highlights for Q4 by segment.,  inventory, \\nWalmart U.S.,  rebalance inventory,  key highlights,  Q4 by segment, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, For Walmart U.S., comp sales were strong throughout the quarter, and December was the largest sales month in Walmart U.S. history. This was led by strength in food sales, which increased high teens, partially offset by mid single-digit decline in general merchandise sales, with softness in toys, electronics, home, and apparel. The effects of product mix shifts have negatively impacted our margins.,  comp sales, \\nfood sales,  general merchandise sales,  product mix shifts,  margins, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Over the last year, grocery and health and wellness sales, which have a lower margin than general merchandise, have increased by 330 basis points as a portion of our mix. We continue to see strong share gains in grocery, with nearly half coming from higher-income households. And private brand penetration increased over 160 basis points as customers prioritize value. Inflation remained high, up mid teens in food categories, which was similar to Q3 levels.,  grocery sales,  health and wellness sales,  private brand penetration, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, E-commerce sales were led by continued strong growth in store-fulfilled pickup and delivery in Q4. Over the last two years, store-fulfilled delivery sales have nearly tripled, and we\\'re now doing over $1 billion a month, which gives you an indication of why we\\'re so excited about the progress here. Advertising sales were also strong this quarter, up 41%. Higher sales and lower COVID costs contributed to SG&A expense leverage, which offset gross profit pressure, resulting in operating income growth of 3.8%.,  e-commerce sales,  store-fulfilled pickup,  advertising sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In international, strong sales trends continued with growth of 5.5% on a constant currency basis, led by double-digit growth in Walmex and China. Currency negatively affected reported sales results by about $900 million or an approximate 340 basis point headwind to growth. Q4 sales benefited from successful festive events across our markets. Year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by the timing shift of Flipkart\\'s Big Billion Days event to Q3 this year versus Q4 last year.,  international sales,\\n constant currency basis,  Walmex,  China,  festive events, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Looking at the second half of the year in total, international sales grew more than 9% in constant currency. E-commerce sales were strong with penetration at 21%, with China leading the way at 48% penetration for the quarter. Walmex had another great quarter with sales strength in bodega stores, Sam\\'s Clubs, and 14% growth in e-commerce. Segment-adjusted operating income grew faster than sales, up nearly 17% in constant currency, helped by effective cost management across markets.,  international sales,  e-commerce sales,  Walmex,  segment-adjusted operating income, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In India, Flipkart continued its strong momentum through Diwali and other seasonal events. We are particularly pleased to see Flipkart\\'s positive contribution margin expanding. PhonePe\\'s recent valuation that Doug talked about was supported by annualized TPV, reaching more than $950 billion, about 50% higher than just one year ago, while also exceeding more than 4 billion monthly transactions. Turning to Sam\\'s Club, our strong momentum continued with comps up 12.6% in Q4 and up 23.4% on a two-year stack.,  Flipkart, \\nIndia,  positive contribution margin,  PhonePe,  Sam\\'s Club, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, The segment delivered another quarter of record member counts, and membership income growth was above 7%. In addition to solid increases in both transaction and ticket, Sam\\'s e-commerce sales were up 21% year over year with contributions from both curbside and ship-to-home. Operating income was pressured in the quarter by elevated markdowns, lapping higher co-branded credit card income last year and an inflation-related LIFO charge of $14 million. With the strong trends at Sam\\'s over the past several years, we\\'re excited to expand our fiscal footprint through a multiyear investment in new clubs and supply chain optimization.,  record member counts,  membership income growth,  e-commerce sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to guidance. As we sit here today, we find ourselves in a similar position to each of the last three years, where there is a great deal of uncertainty looking out over the balance of the year. While the supply chain issues have largely abated, prices are still high. And there is considerable pressure on the consumer.,  guidance, \\nuncertainty,  supply chain issues,  prices,  consumer pressure, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Attempting to predict with precision these swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer behavior is challenging. As such, our guidance reflects a cautious outlook on the macro environment, but at the same time, our excitement about our recent results, momentum in all segments, and progress on our strategy, both for this year and the years that follow. We are positioned well and convicted about our plan. In FY \\'24, we expect operating income growth to outpace sales growth.,  macroeconomic\\nconditions,  consumer behavior,  guidance,  strategy,  operating income growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Given the persistence of high prices and the potential for further macro pressures, we\\'re taking a cautious outlook for the year. We are guiding enterprise sales growth of 2.5% to 3% in constant currency and operating income growth of approximately 3%. This guidance assumes product mix pressures persist, but that our business mix continues to improve. Even with an estimated 100 basis point impact from LIFO charges, we still expect to grow operating income more than sales.,  guidance,  macro\\npressures,  product mix,  business mix,  LIFO charges, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We also expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of 2% to 2.5%, international sales growth in constant currency of approximately 6%, and Sam\\'s Club comp sales growth of approximately 5%, excluding fuel. Based on FX rates at the end of our fiscal year, we estimate a potential year-over-year enterprise sales tailwind of about $1.2 billion from currency. Our purpose starts by helping people save money and live better.,  Walmart U.S. comp\\nsales growth,  international sales growth,  Sam\\'s Club comp sales growth,  enterprise sales\\ntailwind,  purpose, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And it\\'s more important than ever in this environment, as consumers manage household budgets more tightly, making frequent trade-offs and biasing spending toward everyday essentials. We\\'re reinforcing our value proposition across our merchandise offering, including featuring high-quality owned brands and leaning into opening price points. We\\'re accelerating share gains in our food categories and seeing signs of improved attach rates in consumables and high-frequency purchase areas of general merchandise. Our multiyear sales and operating income targets are just that, multiyear.,  consumer behavior,\\n value proposition,  merchandise offering,  share gains,  attach rates, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In some years, our performance will be higher and, in some years, lower. We are confident, however, that we\\'re building a business that allows us to grow our top and bottom line throughout an economic cycle. Over the past five years, sales have grown approximately 6% on average, excluding divestitures. This year will likely be lower, and we look forward to getting back to a sales growth trend more in line with what we\\'ve delivered over the last few years.,  sales growth,  economic cycle,  divestitures, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Over that same period, operating income has grown at about half the rate of sales growth on an adjusted basis, excluding divestitures. This is the result of important investments we\\'ve made in associate wages, pricing, technology, and supply chain, which, together, strengthened our core business and positioned us well for the future. Importantly, while we navigate some of the short-term challenges, we\\'re continuing to invest for the future, invest in ways that strengthen our retail advantages by expanding our capabilities and marketplace, add platform, data ventures, and fulfillment as a service. We\\'re providing more convenience for customers, including pickup and delivery, Scan & Go, and Walmart Plus.,  operating income growth,\\n investments,  retail advantages,  convenience for customers,  Scan & Go, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re working in partnership with our suppliers and sellers to use data-scaled fulfillment capabilities and our rapidly growing ad platform to elevate inventory accuracy and in-stocks, lower the cost to serve, and drive improved conversion. All of this improves the trajectory of our ROI and our margin profile. We will continue to invest in our associates through increased pay and benefits to reinforce the ladder of opportunities at Walmart. But we\\'re managing our costs in a way that allows us to achieve our operating income goals with these investments.,  data-scaled\\nfulfillment,  ad platform,  inventory accuracy,  in-stocks,  ROI and margin profile, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In other words, we\\'re staying true to our commitment of everyday low cost, enabling everyday low prices. We expect FY \\'24 capex to be flat to up slightly in total dollars compared to last year, as we continue the multiyear investment in technology and innovation to optimize our supply chain and stores. Many of these tech enhancements are reaching a stage where we can rapidly deploy them across our network, and we have a clear line of sight toward better efficiencies and ROI on these investments in the medium term. I want to call out a few other assumptions for our guidance for the year.,  everyday low cost,\\n FY \\'24 capex,  technology and innovation,  supply chain,  ROI, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Gross margin rate is expected to increase this year, though not back to FY \\'22 levels yet. We expect gross margin to benefit from the lapping of higher supply chain costs and markdowns from this past year, as well as growth from our newer initiatives, many of which have a higher profit margin. Partially offsetting this, we expect product mix and inflation-related LIFO charges to be gross margin headwinds. Based on current assumptions for inflation, LIFO charges for both Walmart U.S.,  gross margin rate,  supply chain costs,  markdowns,  product mix,  LIFO charges, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Sam\\'s Club could approximate roughly $500 million this year, with the headwind equally proportioned across quarters. This is an improvement from the 1 billion LIFO estimate we provided on the Q3 call due to moderating inflation in key merchandise categories and reduced inventory levels. It\\'s important to note that inflation, inventory levels, and additional factors will influence the aggregate amount. We\\'ll commit to providing updates as we go through the year.,  LIFO estimate, \\ninflation,  inventory levels,  merchandise categories,  updates, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, With sales growth expected at a lower rate versus the prior year and our commitment to continuing to invest in our people and technology, we expect SG&A to delever slightly in FY \\'24. There are also several below-the-line items that will pressure EPS for FY \\'24. First, interest expense is estimated to be about $750 million higher than last year. This translates to an approximate $0.20 cent year-over-year EPS headwind, with Q1\\'s impact less than the remaining quarters.,  SG&A deleveraging, \\nbelow-the-line items,  interest expense,  EPS headwind,  quarterly impact, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Second, we do not expect a repeat of the benefit we realized from certain discrete tax items last year, and as such, expect our tax rate to be more normalized in FY \\'24 at 25.5% to 26.5%, resulting in an approximate $0.10 EPS headwind. And lastly, in our noncontrolling interest line, we expect an approximate $0.12 EPS headwind related to acquiring full ownership of Massmart and Alert Innovation, as well as the impacts to minority interests of strong expected performance at Walmex. In total, these below-the-line factors account for approximately $0.42 of year-over-year EPS headwind. The impact from these below-the-line items offsets the gains we\\'re making in our core business, resulting in EPS being slightly down for the year.,  tax rate, \\nnoncontrolling interest,  below-the-line items,  EPS headwind,  core business, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We expect full year EPS of between $5.90 and $6.05, including a $0.14 headwind from LIFO. For the first quarter, we expect to see a higher rate of sales growth of 4.5% to 5%, largely due to inflation. We expect operating income to increase 3.5% to 4%, including the negative impact of a LIFO charge of approximately 235 basis points. EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.25 to $1.30, including an approximate $0.03 headwind from LIFO.,  EPS,  sales growth,\\n operating income,  LIFO charge,  quarterly impact, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, While we\\'re not providing quarterly guidance beyond Q1, I want to offer the following perspective. We currently expect sales growth to be strongest in the first half, then moderating in the second half, reflecting our macro assumptions in a more difficult year-over-year comparisons. Because we will lap the benefit we received last year from insurance proceeds in 2Q, we expect operating income to be flat in 2Q relative to last year. We expect operating income growth to begin to outpace sales growth to a greater degree in the second half of the year versus the first half.,  quarterly guidance, \\nsales growth,  operating income,  macro assumptions,  insurance proceeds, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In closing, I want to echo Doug\\'s sentiment on our business. Over the last year, our team responded to some of the external challenges with the speed and nimbleness rarely seen in a company of our size. And we exited the year in a much, much better place. As I reflect on where we are today, I\\'m more excited about our future than at any point in my time here.,  external challenges,  team\\nresponse,  future excitement,  company size,  time here, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, The opportunity in front of us is incredible. Our customer member value proposition has never been stronger. Perhaps, that\\'s more obvious during times like this when the consumer is pressured. We have become an omnichannel retailer., Omnichannel retailer,\\ncustomer value proposition, consumer pressure, opportunity, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Who else has the stores and clubs so close to so many customers and members, combined with first- and third-party e-commerce and the combination of grocery and general merchandise and in multiple attractive countries? We\\'re in the right markets with a breadth of assortment and ways of shopping like no one else with impactful and emerging digital and technological capabilities. Our plan leverages our strengths to serve our customers and members in more ways. We meet them where they are to continue to help them save money and time to help them live better. But what you\\'re going to see in the years to come is that we will keep changing, and the changes will improve the composition of our P&L., Omnichannel retailer,\\ncustomer value proposition, market strength, digital capabilities, financial performance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We will have related, diversified higher-margin earnings streams that are scaling rapidly. You will begin to see the significant benefits from the investments that we\\'re making in things like our supply chain automation and our expanded e-commerce capabilities. We\\'re at an inflection point to begin to accelerate margin expansion, reinforcing that the algorithm is in place. The macro pressures this year may obscure some of that progress but won\\'t take away from the long-term promise of many of these initiatives., Supply chain\\nautomation, e-commerce capabilities, margin expansion, macro pressures, long-term promise, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 4, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We look forward to sharing more at our investor day in April. Thank you. Let me turn it over to the operator for questions., Investor day,\\nquestions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you.

Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today\\'s call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC., Forward-looking\\nstatements, risk and uncertainty, SEC filings, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. , Forward-looking\\nstatements, safe harbor statement, non-GAAP reconciliations, cautionary statement, website, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our results for the third quarter. Let me highlight what you\\'ll hear from us this morning. First, it was a good quarter. We delivered strong results on the top line across our segments and our value proposition is resonating with customers and members around the world., Good morning, strong\\nresults, top line, value proposition, customers, members, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We see this in our grocery business, in stores and online, in key markets like the U.S. and Mexico. Customers that came to us less frequently in the past are now shopping with us more often, including higher-income customers. Second, we\\'re being thoughtful and balanced about inventory levels by category and expenses as we work through the fourth quarter and position ourselves for next year., Grocery business,\\nkey markets, customers, inventory levels, expenses, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, There are places where we remain aggressive and others where we\\'re being more conservative. Third, while we prioritize retail fundamentals, we\\'re also connecting and scaling newer, naturally related capabilities to our larger business so they become mutually reinforcing. Marketplace, fulfillment services, and advertising are examples. As it relates to the third quarter, it began with top-line momentum from the back-to-school season in the U.S., top-line momentum,\\nback-to-school season, marketplace, fulfillment services, advertising, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, and Mexico, and that continued through festivals in India, China, and through early deals for days events in the U.S. Walmex had a great quarter and so did Sam\\'s Club in the U.S. as we continued our string of double-digit comp club sales growth. Kath and the team at Sam\\'s had run double-digit comps for almost three years., Walmart, Mexico,\\nIndia, China, U.S., Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We like the way those numbers compound. As a total company, we\\'re seeing strength in stores, clubs, and e-commerce. Transactions are positive and our penetration of e-commerce sales continues to climb. So far, this year, 13% of our total sales as a company now start in a digital fashion., strength, stores,\\nclubs, e-commerce, transactions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, And that\\'s led by Walmart International, which is already at 20%. With the cost of everyday items still stubbornly high in too many categories, more customers and members are choosing us for the value and assortment we\\'re known for and the responding to the changes we made to save them time. With this in mind, we\\'re focusing on earning repeat business from customers who are now shopping with us more frequently than before. For example, a strong presentation throughout fresh and apparel are priorities, along with executing pickup and delivery to create a delightful experience that saves them time., Walmart\\nInternational, value, assortment, time-saving, repeat business, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, And in the case of Walmart U.S., it also means selling more Walmart Plus memberships. As more people look to us for value, we want them to see that the experience of shopping with us is also compelling due to the new capabilities we developed. Our app experiences around the world are a place where we introduce these newer capabilities. As our app becomes more a part of daily life for our customers and members, they find that they can do so much with it, like easily build a shopping cart, schedule a time to pick up an order or have it delivered when it\\'s convenient for them, skip the line with scan & go, or find an item in their local store., Walmart Plus, value,\\ncapabilities, app experiences, convenience, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, As you would expect, we\\'re helping families stretch their dollars as we head into the holidays. The Walmart U.S. team has set the retail prices for a typical Thanksgiving meal the same as last year. We\\'re removing inflation on a basket of traditional Thanksgiving food items, including whole turkeys for under a dollar per pound., holidays, stretching\\ndollars, retail prices, inflation, traditional Thanksgiving food items, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, The members\\' dollars are going further at Sam\\'s Club, too, with racks of lamb and lobster tails priced more than 40% lower than last year. We\\'re also making the everyday shopping trip better by lowering the price of the cafe hotdog combo by nearly 10% to $1.38. Around the world, our teams have this type of mindset. In Mexico, we\\'ve widened the price gaps in our popular Bodega format by 100 basis points this year., members\\' dollars,\\nprices, shopping trip, cafe hotdog combo, price gaps, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, It\\'s incredible value at a time when customers need it most. We\\'re finding creative ways to relieve pressure for families across our merchandise categories and countries. I\\'m proud of how our associates continue to step up. We\\'re grateful for how they\\'ve navigated our inventory challenges this year and continued to prioritize the customer and member experience while doing so., value, customers,\\npressure, merchandise categories, associates, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, During my store club and DC visits, they inspire me by the way they work together, the way they serve others, and how they\\'re embracing change and contributing ideas to improve our business. Looking ahead, we updated our outlook for the year on results from Q3. Yet, we remained balanced in our approach to the rest of Q4 and next year. Inflation is being especially stubborn in some categories like dry grocery., inspiration, change,\\nimprovement, outlook, inflation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Living with high prices through this year has a cumulative impact on our customers, especially for those that are most budget conscious. And so, we\\'re focused on bringing our costs and prices down as quickly as possible by item and category. Regardless of income levels, families are more price conscious now, so it\\'s as important as ever that we earn their trust with value. In just a minute, John David will share more about the guidance we gave this morning., costs, prices,\\nbudget conscious, income levels, value, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re working to position ourselves to succeed regardless of demand levels through value and the experience we offer and the way we\\'re positioning inventory and expenses. We\\'re into the details, business by business. This is not a time to paint with a broad brush. We\\'re focused on the things we can control., value, experience,\\ninventory, expenses, details, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We delivered good expense leverage during the quarter across our segments. Strong sales growth helps, but we\\'re also doing a good job of managing costs, and we\\'re doing it in a sustainable way. We can keep costs in line and continue to invest in our people and technology, including supply chain automation, and continue to deliver value for customers, members, and shareholders. We\\'ve made good progress to improve our inventory position., expense leverage,\\nsales growth, cost management, supply chain automation, inventory position, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Globally, inventory is up 13% for the quarter, including 12.4% for Walmart U.S. and 2.5% for international. Inflation drives the majority of the increase rather than units. In-stock on replenishable items and active management of seasonal item quantities and sell-throughs are the priorities., inventory,\\ninflation, units, in-stock, sell-through, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We expect this progress to continue through the fourth quarter and that we\\'ll end the year in even better shape. Our merchants have taken an item-by-item, category-by-category approach to match inventory with demand. We\\'ve worked through a unique period in history as we chased inventory in 2020 and 2021 and were too heavy in some general merchandise categories this year. Given where inflation remains and that economic uncertainty seems higher than normal, the quantity choice our merchants make is even more crucial than in a more normal time back when there was such a thing as a more normal time., inventory, demand,\\ninflation, merchants, economic uncertainty, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We can be more aggressive on shorter lead time items like food and consumables, but we\\'re especially sensitive to quantity decisions on longer lead time items that are imported. We\\'re thankful to have so many experienced and talented merchants. They\\'ve accomplished a lot these past few quarters. Just like John, Kath, Judith, and the rest of the team have done, they\\'ve demonstrated good judgment and a lot of hustle., merchants, imported\\nitems, shorter lead time, longer lead time, judgment, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Our flywheel continues to take shape. We\\'re scaling our newer businesses and connecting them to our larger, established retail businesses, primarily by how we design digital interactions. One example is how our growth in e-commerce, especially the marketplace, fuels our ad business. More items and sellers drive GMV and improve customer satisfaction., flywheel, digital\\ninteractions, e-commerce, GMV, customer satisfaction, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, And it also drives success in advertising. They\\'re mutually reinforcing. If we double-click on advertising with Walmart Connect in the U.S., we see it\\'s benefiting from growth in e-commerce and from improvements made within the business itself. And we\\'ve seen strong growth in return on ad spend over last year., advertising,\\ne-commerce, return on ad spend, Walmart Connect, growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, In turn, this helped drive the highest ad spend all year for sponsored search in Q3. These improvements underscore Connect\\'s strengths and position the business for continued growth. We also continue to see strong growth with Flipkart Ads in India. Like much of what we\\'re doing, advertising is working for us globally because we have something unique to offer media buyers, and these businesses create momentum for each other., advertising,\\nsponsored search, Flipkart Ads, growth, momentum, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, As with advertising, growing our marketplace business also unlocks fulfillment services opportunities through both fulfillment centers and last-mile delivery. We\\'re scaling these businesses in the U.S., and we\\'re starting to ramp up in Mexico and Canada. The team in Mexico increased the number of sellers on our marketplace by 20% during the quarter. In the U.S., the marketplace on Walmart.com now offers about 370 million SKUs., growing marketplace\\nbusiness, fulfillment services, fulfillment centers, last-mile delivery, seller growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, That\\'s an increase of more than 50% from Q2. Many of these sellers want to leverage our fulfillment network. They also want to use our advertising capabilities to drive demand, and we\\'re making that easier for them. We recently shared that all new marketplace sellers in the U.S., fulfillment network,\\nadvertising capabilities, demand generation, seller growth, Q2, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, will be automatically onboarded onto our self-service ad platform. We believe this seamless integration will help both businesses scale even faster. What you see in our results is that we can run compelling stores and clubs, scale of first- and third-party e-commerce business, and connect them together in an omnichannel fashion that saves customers and members money and time. Our strategy unlocks growth opportunities for us and a thread that runs from digital retail to fulfillment and advertising, and opens up even more opportunities with health and wellness and financial services., digital retail,\\ne-commerce, omnichannel fashion, growth opportunities, financial services, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, This quarter demonstrates, again, that we can navigate short-term challenges and build for the long term simultaneously. It\\'s been my experience over all these years that Walmart is a well-positioned business and is inherently hedged. When times are good, we have room to grow. When things are more difficult, we sell things people want and need at a value and in ways they want to shop., long-term growth,\\nshort-term challenges, hedged business, value shopping, customer needs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, And with new levers for growth across our flywheel, we\\'re becoming even stronger and more resilient. I\\'ll close today by saying thank you for your interest in our company. We like the momentum we are creating in our business, and we recognize the need for a balanced approach in the near term given the continued strains on our customers and members. Our team is focused and alert., momentum, growth,\\nflywheel, resilience, customer needs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Doug. I\\'d like to start by thanking our customers, associates, and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter. I will focus my comments on the themes Doug mentioned. First, our sales momentum and share gains., sales momentum,\\nshare gains, customer base, partnerships, quarterly results, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Second, operational actions we\\'re taking to improve inventory and supply chain. Third, progress we\\'re making to further connect our alternative value streams to our core business. And lastly, our guidance for the balance of the year. Our Q3 results exceeded our expectations due to sales upside, with operating expense leverage across all three business segments., sales upside,\\ninventory management, supply chain, alternative value streams, quarterly guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, While we\\'re encouraged by our position and our confidence in our business remains high, the macro backdrop remains challenging as persistent inflation is impacting the consumer and our business. As I discuss our results, it\\'s important to note the charges related to the opioid legal settlement framework affect year-over-year comparisons, so my comments regarding Q3 results will focus on the business, excluding adjusted items. Total constant currency revenue grew 9.8% as our omni model and strong value proposition continue to resonate with customers during this period abroad inflationary pressures. Each of our segments delivered strong sales results., macro backdrop,\\npersistent inflation, opioid legal settlement, year-over-year comparisons, omni model, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Walmart U.S. comp sales accelerated sequentially to 8.2% growth, with increases in average ticket size, as well as transactions. Constant currency sales in Walmart International were strong, up 13.3%, led by Flipkart and Walmex, while Sam\\'s Club U.S. delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with growth of 10.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco., Walmart U.S. comp\\nsales, sequential growth, average ticket size, transactions, Walmart International constant currency\\nsales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Our purpose of saving people money has never been more important as inflation remains consistently high. High fuel prices and mid-teens food inflation have forced consumers to manage household budgets more tightly, making frequent trade-offs and biasing spending toward everyday essentials. We continue to manage pricing in a way that preserves our price gaps while gaining market share profitably. Walmart is well positioned to serve customers and gain greater trip frequency during tougher economic periods, and we have even more tools to do so in this cycle., inflation, high fuel\\nprices, food inflation, pricing management, market share, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, For example, we\\'ve continued to gain grocery market share from households across income demographics, with nearly three-quarters of the share gain coming from those exceeding $100,000 in annual income. This quarter, our private brand penetration in food categories increased about 130 basis points, reflecting customers increased focus on quality products at value prices. We observed incremental trade down in categories, including proteins, baking goods, baby and dog food. We\\'re working hard to keep prices low and help ease the burden to make customers lives better., grocery market\\nshare, private brand penetration, incremental trade down, customer focus on quality products, price\\nmanagement, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, This includes working with vendors to reduce product cost and minimize inflation impacts on final goods pricing. Consolidated gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points. More than half of the decline was due to markdowns and sales mix in the U.S. The remaining headwind reflects a $113 million LIFO charge at Sam\\'s Club due to inflation and the timing of sales events in international, including Flipkart\\'s Big Billion Days., Cost reduction, pricing, gross margin, inflation, LIFO charge, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Notably, the rate of decline in gross margin improved from 2Q as inventory remediation efforts are progressing. We\\'ve been very targeted in reducing certain categories of inventory in our system, and our actions included canceling orders and increasing the level of markdowns. The team has done a really good job addressing our inventory situation as reflected by Q3 inventory being up only 13% versus last year, including 12.4% growth in Walmart U.S. In aggregate, this level represents a more than 10-percentage-point improvement versus the end of Q2., Inventory remediation, gross margin rate,\\nmarkdowns, inventory growth, Q3 inventory, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Notably, about 70% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation. We feel good about our ability to sell through the majority of this in Q4 and expect continued year-over-year improvement even when including the effects of inflation. We saw stronger expense leverage this quarter as selling, general, and administrative expenses leveraged 75 basis points due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID costs. We\\'re focused on what we can control and continue to work down inventory levels and manage general and administrative expenses tightly., Inflation, Q4 sales, expense leverage,\\ninventory management, COVID costs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Taking all this together, adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis increased 4.6%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.66, but adjusted EPS was $1.50. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects a $1.11 impact from unrealized losses on equity investments, primarily JD.com, and $1.05 charge related to the opioid litigation settlement framework. We\\'re pleased that our adjusted EPS outperformed the guidance we provided in August due primarily to better operating expense leverage on higher sales across the business., Adjusted operating income, constant currency\\nbasis, GAAP EPS, unrealized losses, equity investments, opioid litigation settlement framework, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Operating cash flow for the year-to-date period decreased $600 million to $15.7 billion, primarily due to the timing of certain payments and a decrease in operating income, partially offset by moderated inventory purchases. During the quarter, we returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. We\\'re committed to continuing to provide strong cash returns to shareholders while still appropriately investing in our business for the long term. And our board has just approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization that we expect to utilize over the next several years., Operating cash flow, year-to-date period,\\ndividend, share repurchases, board approval, new share repurchase authorization, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Let me briefly reference key highlights by segment. For Walmart U.S., comp sales momentum accelerated in Q3 with a two-year stack of 17.4%, up 570 basis points from Q2. Monthly sales gains were relatively consistent throughout the quarter. Food sales continued to lead with mid-teens growth., Walmart U.S., comp sales, Q3, monthly sales,\\nfood sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re particularly encouraged to see year-over-year growth in food units sold after experiencing a slight decline last quarter. We also continue to make good progress on improving in-stock levels in our grocery business despite the heavy volumes we\\'re experiencing. Inflation remained high at mid-teens percentage in food categories, reflecting an 80-basis-point step up compared to levels at the end of Q2. We\\'ve seen incremental levels of inflation month over month be less significant, but it\\'s not clear if this represents a sustainable trend., Food units sold, in-stock levels, grocery\\nbusiness, inflation, Q2, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, However, we believe our strong price positioning is contributing to share gains as we attract value-seeking customers across the household income spectrum. General merchandise sales declined low single digits, with softness in electronics, home, and apparel. E-commerce accelerated sequentially to 16% growth, even as store transactions continued to grow. We experienced strength in pickup and delivery from stores, marketplace, fulfillment services, and advertising., Strong price positioning, share gains,\\nvalue-seeking customers, general merchandise sales, e-commerce growth, pickup and delivery, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Gross profit rate decreased 77 basis points due primarily to higher markdowns and product mix headwinds. But the team delivered strong SG&A expenses leverage of 60 basis points, reflecting higher sales and lower COVID cost. As a result, we deliver better-than-expected operating income growth of nearly 5%. Walmart International delivered strong sales results, with sales up 13.3% in constant currency, despite continued macro headwinds., Gross profit rate, SG&A expenses, operating\\nincome growth, Walmart International, macro headwinds, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, E-commerce sales on a constant currency basis were exceptionally strong, up 46% in the quarter. The earlier timing of Flipkart\\'s Big Billion Days event was also a benefit to sales results. Currency negatively affected reported sales results by about $1.5 billion. Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales, led by a great quarter from Walmex, with comp sales growth of 11.7%, reflecting strong performance in Bodega stores, Sam\\'s Clubs, and 17% growth in e-commerce., E-commerce sales, constant currency basis,\\nFlipkart\\'s Big Billion Days event, comp sales growth, Walmex, Bodega stores, Sam\\'s Clubs, e-commerce\\ngrowth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In China, comp sales were up 5.6%, reflecting strong e-commerce growth, as well as strength at Sam\\'s Club. E-commerce sales grew 63% and penetration reached 41% of sales. Canada comp sales increased more than 5%. And in October, we launched Walmart Fulfillment Services in Canada, where sellers of all sizes on the digital marketplace can now contract with us to take care of their inventory storage and logistics needs., E-commerce growth, Sam\\'s Club, comp sales,\\nCanada, Walmart Fulfillment Services, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, The new offering will provide faster shipping of customer orders within a two-day window to 95% of Canadians. In India, Flipkart had a great quarter, with strong customer response to our Big Billion Days event, which moved forward into Q3 this year from Q4 last year. We had over 1 billion visits to our site during the eight-day event and, importantly, saw more than 60% of those customers coming from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. PhonePe also continues to perform well, with annualized total payment volume, or TPV, now over $920 billion and reaching a record level of monthly transactions to about 3.6 billion., Faster shipping, customer orders, two-day\\nwindow, Canadians, Big Billion Days event, Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, PhonePe, TPV, monthly\\ntransactions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, This was the first time PhonePe had a quarter with more than 10 billion transactions. International segment operating income was better than expected and increased 3.2% in constant currency led by Walmex and China. In Sam\\'s Club U.S., we had another strong quarter, with comp sales up more than 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, and an increase of more than 25% on a two-year stack. Both comp transactions and average ticket increased about 5%; and e-commerce sales grew 20%, with strength in curbside orders and ship to home., PhonePe, transactions, international\\nsegment, operating income, Walmex, China, Sam\\'s Club U.S., comp sales, e-commerce sales, curbside\\norders, ship to home, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Membership income was up 8%, with another record-high quarter in overall member counts and an all-time high Plus member penetration. Sam\\'s leveraged expense is 68 basis points due primarily to higher sales. This helped offset a decline in gross profit rate due primarily to a 53-basis-point, or $113 million, inflation-related LIFO charge. For the quarter, Sam\\'s operating income increased more than 18% with fuel and nearly 8% excluding fuel and including the impact of the LIFO charge., Membership income, record-\\nhigh quarter, Plus member penetration, leveraged expense, gross profit rate, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Combining these results with my comments about international, you can see Sam\\'s Club is performing well around the world, and we\\'re pleased with the leverage we see across markets, with Member\\'s Mark as an example. As we navigate changes to our external environment, we continue to advance our strategic initiatives that were enabled by our omnichannel retail capabilities. Globally, as we\\'re building a larger e-commerce business, we\\'re scaling our marketplace which unlocks and strengthens our fulfillment and advertising businesses and expands the number of families that choose to be members. Across our segments, e-commerce is enabling deeper engagement with customers and members that helps drive strategic growth in our alternative value streams., Member\\'s Mark, omnichannel retail\\ncapabilities, e-commerce business, fulfillment business, advertising business, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, New sellers on our U.S. marketplace are contributing to our advertising growth, and we added more than 8,000 sellers in Q3. Third-party build-out helps diversify and strengthen our product assortment, which now includes more than 370 million SKUs. Strong digital advertising growth continued this quarter, increasing over 30% on a global basis, led by 40% growth in Walmart Connect in the U.S., New sellers, advertising growth, third-\\nparty sellers, product assortment, digital advertising, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Flipkart Ads in India. As we focus on membership, our ability to leverage our data improves. So, we continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering Walmart Luminate, and the number of Walmart Plus memberships continues to grow. We gained some of these new Walmart Plus members after expanding our last-mile delivery capabilities through a fourfold increase since January and the number of pickup points serviced by the Spark Driver platform., membership, data ventures, Walmart\\nLuminate, last-mile delivery, Spark Driver, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re making good progress in fulfillment and automation. The Spark Driver platform now serves customers in all 50 states from more than 10,000 pickup points, with the ability to reach 84% of all U.S. households. This coverage includes a growing revenue stream from businesses utilizing Walmart GoLocal, our delivery as a service offering, that has already made over 1 million deliveries since launching last year., fulfillment, automation, Spark Driver, pickup points, Walmart GoLocal, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Building Walmart Fulfillment Services in the U.S., Mexico, and now also in Canada has been an important asset in growing our seller base as they seek an integrated omni sales and fulfillment solution. For example, almost 30% of orders on Walmex\\'s marketplace are now being fulfilled using Walmart Fulfillment Services, which was launched a year ago. In September, we opened a next-gen fulfillment center in Illinois. This 1.1 million square foot facility features robotics, machine learning, and automated storage, resulting in increased productivity and a better service for our customers at faster delivery times., Walmart Fulfillment Services, omni\\nsales, fulfillment solution, seller base, next-gen fulfillment center, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And last week, we acquired Alert Innovation as we expand our market fulfillment center build-out. MFCs are positioned inside or attached to Walmart Supercenters and use robotics and AI to fill online orders more quickly. We\\'re putting the building blocks in place to deliver a powerful, mutually reinforcing ecosystem that not only benefits customers and partners, but also shareholders with more durable and diversified earnings streams. Turning to guidance., acquired Alert Innovation, MFCs, robotics and AI, building blocks, diversified earnings streams, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In this period of macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that we are well equipped to continue gaining market share in an environment where consumers need to stretch their dollars further. We will continue to advocate for customers and work with our supplier partners to maintain strong price gaps and deliver lower relative pricing versus competitors. We\\'re also navigating real inflation on our own cost structure and continue to seek ways to reduce costs and improve leverage potential. With these considerations in mind, we\\'re maintaining a balanced approach to our guidance, incorporating a cautious view on the consumer together with our confidence in our ability to execute., macroeconomic uncertainty, gaining market\\nshare, price gaps, cost structure, guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re updating fiscal year \\'23 guidance to reflect the Q3 upside and leading our sales and profit assumptions for Q4 unchanged. Despite a good start to Q4, our guidance assumes that the consumer could slow spending, especially in general merchandise categories, given persistent inflationary pressures in food and consumables. Our guidance provides flexibility to compete in a promotional environment, accounts for pricing action to reduce remaining excess inventory, and anticipates ongoing mix pressure. For Q4, we expect net sales growth of about 3%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart U.S., with food and consumables growth continuing to outpace general merchandise., fiscal year \\'23 guidance, Q3 upside, Q4\\nsales and profit assumptions, consumer spending, persistent inflationary pressures, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We expect year-over-year operating income within a range of a 1% increase to a 1% decrease. And adjusted EPS is expected to decrease 3% to 5%, including higher year-over-year tax and interest expenses. For the full year, incorporating the Q3 upside, we now expect net sales growth of about 5.5%, including comp sales growth of 5.5% for Walmart U.S. On an adjusted basis, we expect operating income to decline 6.5% to 7.5% and EPS to decline 6% to 7%., year-over-year operating income, adjusted EPS, Q3 upside, full year net sales growth, comp sales growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Excluding the effect of divestitures and on an adjusted basis, this would translate into net sales growth of 6.5% and a decline in operating income of 5.5% to 6.5% and a decline in EPS of 5% to 6%. Looking beyond Q4, we know some of the unanticipated costs experienced this year shouldn\\'t repeat next year. That said, we\\'re planning our business with the assumption that inflation remains somewhat elevated. In addition, we\\'ve had significant currency headwinds this year., excluding divestitures, net sales\\ngrowth, operating income, EPS, inflation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Based on year-to-date results and current FX rates, we estimate a year-over-year sales headwind for this fiscal year of $4.1 billion from currency and a potential sales headwind of about $3 billion next year. Also, as we\\'ve had $236 million in LIFO charges this year at Sam\\'s Club, we\\'re likely to experience LIFO charges in Walmart U.S. as well next year. Based on current assumptions, these LIFO charges next year for both Walmart U.S., year-to-date results, current FX rates, sales headwind, LIFO charges, assumptions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 3, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Sam\\'s Club could approximate roughly $1 billion of gross profit headwind. It\\'s important to note that inflation, inventory levels, and additional factors that are challenging to predict will influence the aggregate amount. We\\'re committed to providing you ongoing updates to the assumptions as we report our quarterly results. And with that, we\\'d be happy to take your questions., gross profit\\nheadwind, inflation, inventory levels, quarterly results, updates, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Dan Binder, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to Walmart\\'s second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call.

A few weeks ago, we updated you on our expectations for how we would perform in Q2 and for the year. The second quarter finished stronger than we had anticipated, and John David will touch on that in a moment and provide more detail for the back half of the year. Our sales were well ahead of plan with inflation lifting our average transaction size, but we know that the amount and persistence of inflation is negatively affecting many families., good morning,\\nsales, inflation, quarter, year, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, From the U.S. to Mexico to Canada to Chile, they\\'re prioritizing how they spend their money. We\\'re pleased to see more families from a variety of income levels choose us as they look for value. Our purpose is to save people money and help them live better, and that\\'s especially important right now., prioritizing\\nspending, saving people money, helping families live better, income levels, value, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, After the first quarter, we shared how the environment had changed. The cost of food and fuel, a heavier mix of sales in food and consumables, and excess inventory in general merchandise categories were among the most challenging items for us at the time. As we move through Q2, food inflation continued to tick up, and we continue to see a heavier mix of sales in food and consumables in many of our markets, and that put pressure on margins overall. Food comps in the U.S., cost of food, cost of fuel, challenging items, food inflation,\\nheavier mix of sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, were up mid-teens for the quarter with units in food slightly negative and about flat exiting the quarter even with double-digit inflation. Another weight on margins has been the number of markdowns we\\'ve taken. Starting back in March, we knew we needed to act quickly and aggressively in some categories, and we have. We\\'ve made good progress to reduce inventory levels where we focused and taken markdowns., units,\\ninflation, markdowns, inventory levels, categories, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, The aggressive approach we took to move through apparel, in particular, put financial pressure on us, but it helped relieve pressure on our stores and through our supply chain. We\\'re making good progress to reduce costs. We\\'ve reduced the number of shipping containers in our system, for example, by more than half from the Q1 level and are now much closer to our historical averages. We\\'re also managing pricing to reflect our fully landed costs., aggressive\\napproach, financial pressure, reducing costs, shipping containers, pricing, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, The merchants are adjusting by category to reflect where we expect demand to be. We had our U.S. store manager meeting last week and among other topics, we shared examples of items where we\\'re holding prices down or rolling them back. Those tend to be opening price point, private brand, food, and consumables items., demand, prices,\\nholding prices, rolling back, categories, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We want to help families put meals on the table with great value in our other private brands to relieve the pressure they\\'re feeling. The quality, value, and convenience we offer make Walmart a smart choice, and we\\'re seeing more middle and higher-income shoppers choose us. As I\\'ve been in U.S. stores recently, I\\'m pleased with how we\\'ve executed back to school., families,\\nvalue, pressure, quality, convenience, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, As we finish it off in some markets, we\\'ve transitioned back to college in the appropriate stores with items like mini refrigerators, floor-length mirrors, and futons. In July, I got to visit our associates in India. After visits to Flipkart, Mantra, and PhonePe, a Flipkart fulfillment center, and a [Inaudible] to see how they\\'re using PhonePe, I left even more excited about what\\'s happening in these businesses and what\\'s to come. Having visited several of our international markets this year, I\\'m pleased by how connected we are now and how so much of what we\\'re building is common across markets as we scale marketplace businesses and fulfillment advertising and financial services take steps to make a bigger difference in healthcare., college, India,\\nFlipkart, PhonePe, markets, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, As I look ahead, I expect a strong finish to the back-to-school season, and we\\'ll quickly transition to the holidays. Our fall and holiday products look great. There\\'s a lot of newnesses, and we\\'ve got a strong position in opening price points across categories. From Halloween to Christmas to Flipkart\\'s big billion days, we\\'ll be ready., back-to-school,\\nholidays, newness, opening price points, categories, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll have a cleaner inventory position and will have a strong seasonal presence. We expect inflation to continue influence the choices that families make, and we\\'re adjusting to that reality so we can help them more. Regardless of the inflation level and as we work through the places we have too much inventory, we continue to make progress on our strategy. We\\'re becoming more digital, even more relevant as an omnichannel retailer, and the related businesses, like fulfillment and advertising, continue to grow., cleaner\\ninventory position, strong seasonal presence, inflation, omnichannel retailer, related businesses, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re building a different business, and we\\'re making progress. Let\\'s move on to our operating segments. I\\'ll start with Walmart U.S. The strong comps we see in food and consumables are leading to market share gains., Walmart U.S.,\\nfood, consumables, market share gains, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Pickup and delivery are strong. Growth is improving on Walmart.com, including the marketplace. And more people are choosing to be a Walmart Plus member, or step up to in-home. Walmart Plus is an important component of our plan, and we announced the addition of a streaming benefit., pickup,\\ndelivery, Walmart.com, marketplace, Walmart Plus, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart Plus members will receive a Paramount Plus subscription at no additional cost as part of their Walmart Plus membership in September. The premium streaming service offers a broad content offering with original series, movies, family shows, and live sports. We\\'re excited about the coming launch, and we know our members will be too. Beyond membership, the team is also working on getting items to customers faster, while lowering the cost of delivery through a significant increase in the number of orders fulfilled by stores., Walmart Plus,\\nParamount Plus, membership, delivery, store fulfillment, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve increased this volume by nearly 40% from a year ago. Speed matters, whether it\\'s how quickly we get items to customers or how quickly we scale new businesses. Our white label delivery platform service, Walmart Go Local, will celebrate its one-year anniversary later this month. Powered by our Spark Driver platform, I\\'m excited about the growth I\\'ve seen so far and the expectations looking ahead., volume, speed,\\nWalmart Go Local, Spark Driver, growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We passed 1 million deliveries so far with Go Local. We expect to have about 5,000 pickup locations by year end and client satisfaction scores are strong. We continue to sign up larger-scale customers, and we\\'re making strides on the bigger unlock, which are small and medium-sized businesses. Our technology and expertise will help so many of these businesses grow while contributing to our operating margins over time., Go Local,\\npickup locations, client satisfaction scores, larger-scale customers, bigger unlock, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Advertising is also performing well. In Walmart U.S., the Connect team continues to deliver more value to the suppliers and sellers who advertise with us. Improvements to search and our large first-party shopper data have led to performance improvements for our advertisers, both year over year and sequentially. We\\'ve seen the number of active advertisers investing with us increase 121% over last year., advertising,\\nConnect team, suppliers, sellers, search, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Even more encouraging, these improvements have supported the overall site experience for our customers by helping them find the right products or discover new ones that are most relevant to them. As you\\'ve heard us say before, advertising is a global priority for us. We continue to see strong growth in markets outside the U.S., like India and Mexico. Turning to Sam\\'s Club in the U.S., advertising,\\ncustomers, site experience, growth, markets, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Comp sales were strong again for Q2, up 10%. And marking the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Similar to Walmart, gross profit was pressured for the quarter on higher-than-normal markdown activity to clear through excess inventory. We\\'ll continue to make progress as we move through Q3, and we\\'ll be in good shape as we enter the holiday season., comp sales,\\ngross profit, markdown activity, inventory, holiday season, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, We like what we see in terms of membership. Total accounts are up about 9% over last year, and the penetration of Plus members continues to climb. Moving on to Walmart International, where we performed well again in Q2 with sales up nearly 10%, including double-digit comps in the three largest markets of Mexico, Canada, and China. We\\'re also accelerating our digital businesses, including strong e-commerce growth over the last two years., membership,\\nPlus members, Walmart International, sales, e-commerce, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, Mexico is up 31%; Canada, 32%; and China 152%. We see this growth even as customers choose to do more in-person shopping. It really shows the power of operating across multiple channels. Like the U.S., we see the effects of inflation come through in how people are shopping., Mexico, Canada,\\nChina, growth, inflation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, In Mexico, we saw all formats perform well, and Bodega was especially strong with comps above the overall Walmex average. We widened our price gaps for Bodega by 140 basis points in Q2, and we\\'re seeing more customers shopping this format. While inflation remains high, most of our markets are growing comps ahead of inflation. I\\'m proud that we\\'re helping families access the things they need at more affordable prices., Mexico, Bodega,\\ncomps, inflation, growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, Doug McMillon, Chief Executive Officer, I\\'ll close today by thanking our associates for all they do every day to support customers and members. I\\'d also like to welcome John David for his first earnings call with us. And with that, I\\'ll turn it over to him., associates,\\ncustomers, members, John David, welcome, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Doug. I\\'d like to start by thanking our customers, associates, and partners for helping us deliver another strong sales quarter. We\\'re moving a lot of volume through our business, and I\\'m proud of how our associate team has responded and serving customers as we manage through this unique period. We delivered strong top-line growth with total constant currency revenue up more than 9% in the second quarter., customers,\\nassociates, partners, sales, growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Sales were strong across all segments, particularly in food and consumables. Customers are increasingly choosing Walmart to help them save money as they deal with broad inflationary pressures. As we navigate the current environment, we know that we\\'re not immune to large macroeconomic shifts. We\\'re facing similar cost pressures that others are seeing related to excess inventory, fuel prices, and supply chain., sales,\\ncustomers, inflation, macroeconomic shifts, cost pressures, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, But our business model is structurally sound and our market position is strong. As the year has progressed, we\\'ve seen more pronounced consumer shifts and trade-down activity. As an example, instead of deli meats at higher price points, customers are increasing purchases of hotdogs as well as canned tuna or chicken. Private brand penetration has also inflected higher., business model,\\nmarket position, consumer shifts, trade-down activity, private brand penetration, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And in food category, specifically, the private brand growth rate doubled compared to Q1 levels. We\\'ll continue to manage pricing for customers in a way that preserves our price gaps and allows us to earn market share profitably. We\\'ve been very focused on managing controllable costs and consequently achieved expense leverage across all three segments in Q2, even though we haven\\'t fully lapped the wage investments implemented last year. During the quarter, we also made progress reducing inventory, managing prices to reflect certain supply chain costs and inflation and reducing storage costs associated with the backlog of shipping containers., private brand\\ngrowth, pricing management, controllable costs, expense leverage, inventory management, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re encouraged by the initial steps taken by some suppliers to help us reduce product acquisition costs. We\\'ve taken similar steps to manage our support and overhead cost, too, and we\\'re achieving significant savings in the procurement of goods, not for resale. In our stores and fulfillment and distribution centers, we\\'ve seen labor productivity metrics improve. We\\'re finding efficiencies and reducing expenses while still focusing on operational excellence., suppliers,\\nprocurement, labor productivity, efficiency, expenses, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, I want to spend a moment discussing inventory. As a backdrop, the shifts that we\\'ve seen in consumer behavior through the pandemic, shifting from in-store to online, along with big swings in the purchase of goods versus services. and then the reversion back to pre-pandemic norms has been sharp and difficult to predict. These trends have been exacerbated by inflationary pressure on the consumer that many of us have not experienced in our lifetime, the effect of which has recently changed consumption patterns in certain categories for us, notably general merchandise., inventory,\\nconsumer behavior, pandemic, inflation, consumption patterns, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, The result of all of this put pressure on our inventory levels that peaked in the last quarter. Importantly, the team has a deep understanding of our inventory levels and content have made a lot of progress during the last quarter. In-stock levels have improved about 250 basis points since Q1 in our grocery business alone, despite the heavy sales volumes we\\'re experiencing. We also made progress selling through excess inventory, especially in hardline categories., inventory\\nlevels, in-stock levels, sales volumes, excess inventory, progress, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, At the end of Q2, Walmart U.S. inventory growth was 26% versus last year, reflecting over 750 basis points of improvement from Q1 levels. Notably, about 40% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation. General merchandise inventory growth rates are down more than 15 percentage points from Q1, but still with work to do., inventory\\ngrowth, inflation, general merchandise inventory, improvement, work to do, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'ve cleared most summer seasonal inventory, but we are still focused on reducing exposure to other areas such as electronics, home and sporting goods. We\\'ve also canceled billions of dollars in orders to help align inventory levels with expected demand. We estimate that only about 15% of our total inventory growth in Q2 is still above optimal levels, and our actions in Q3 will allow us to make significant progress toward rationalizing absolute levels and mix, which will enable our stores to be well positioned ahead of the holiday season. Despite the short-term challenges we\\'re facing this year, we continue to advance our flywheel strategy and diversify our income streams., inventory\\nlevels, demand, orders, flywheel strategy, income streams, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, For example, the global advertising business grew nearly 30% in Q2, led by Walmart Connect and Flipkart, as new advertisers turn to Walmart to deepen relationships with customers. We now have over 240 million items in our U.S. e-commerce assortment, and our marketplace seller count has increased about 60% year over year. We continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering and the number of Walmart Plus memberships continues to grow., advertising business, Walmart Connect, Flipkart, U.S. e-commerce assortment, marketplace\\nsellers, data ventures offering, Walmart Plus memberships, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re also excited about the build-out of automation and technology throughout our business and how it will continue to help drive greater efficiency. Through my first couple of months here, I\\'ve been able to get out and visit our stores and see our distribution and fulfillment centers and witness the supply chain automation and technology that we\\'re putting in our stores and centers. One example is the VizPick technology that we\\'ve rolled out to our associates across U.S. stores., automation, technology, efficiency, supply chain, VizPick technology, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, This tool uses augmented reality to speed the inventory management process, enabling associates to get needed product from the back room to the sales floor more efficiently. This not only saves associate time but also helps avoid missing sales through side counter out of stocks. It\\'s a win-win. In summary, our business is resilient., inventory\\nmanagement, associate time, sales floor, back room, winning, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And with the omni capabilities we\\'ve built, we\\'re better positioned now than we were in prior periods of economic softness. Now let\\'s get to some additional Q2 financial details. As mentioned previously, each of our segments delivered strong sales growth. Walmart U.S., omni capabilities, economic softness, sales growth, Walmart U.S., segment delivery, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, comp sales accelerated to 6.5% growth, reflecting strong grocery sales at a higher average ticket size. International constant currency sales were up 9.9% with strength in Mexico, Canada, and China, while Sam\\'s Club U.S. delivered comps of 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco. Consolidated gross margin rate decreased 132 basis points, reflecting increased markdowns and unfavorable mix shifts in our U.S., comp sales growth, grocery sales, average ticket size, international sales, Sam\\'s Club\\nU.S., Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, businesses. Sam\\'s Club gross profit was also negatively affected by a LIFO charge due to higher inflation. On the expense side, selling, general, and administrative expenses leveraged 45 basis points, helped by higher sales, partially offset by the U.S. wage investments implemented last year., LIFO charge, inflation, selling general and administrative expenses, wage investments,\\nU.S., Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Operating income decreased 6.8% and adjusted EPS was $1.77. Two discrete items positively affected our results. Operating income benefited from a favorable insurance settlement of $173 million during the quarter. Adjusted EPS also benefited from this as well as a $182 million special dividend from one of our equity investments., insurance settlement, special dividend, adjusted EPS, operating income, equity investments, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Operating cash flow was $9.2 billion, reflecting lower operating income, higher inventory amounts due in part to inflation and the timing of certain payments. During the quarter, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. Through Q2, we are ahead of pace on our original share repurchase plan for this year and now expect to repurchase $10 billion to $11 billion in shares for fiscal year 2023. Now let\\'s discuss segment results., operating cash flow, inventory amounts, shareholder returns, share repurchase, segment\\nresults, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Walmart U.S. comp sales momentum continued with growth excluding fuel of 11.7% on a two-year stack. Food sales were especially strong with mid-teens growth while general merchandise sales were soft, particularly in electronics, apparel, and home.

SG&A expenses leveraged 21 basis points, reflecting higher sales and lower COVID costs, partially offset by the wage investments. The team did a nice job pivoting the expense structure, so the scheduling challenges from Q1 did not repeat. Gross margin pressure led to a decline in operating income of about 7%., e-commerce sales growth, SG&A expenses, wage investments, gross margin pressure, operating\\nincome, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, International had another really good quarter.

Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales with Mexico and China leading the way., International sales, constant currency, currency headwinds,\\ncomp sales, major markets, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, E-commerce sales on a constant currency basis grew 15% on top of strong gains last year. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 11% with strong growth in stores as well as e-commerce sales, which grew 18%. The team is doing a good job reinforcing our price message and positioning as customers manage through this inflationary period. In China, comp sales were up more than 14% with strong growth in e-commerce sales, which increased 77% in the quarter and more than 150% on a two-year stack., e-commerce sales, constant currency basis, comp sales, Mexico, China, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, E-commerce penetration continues to climb in both our Sam\\'s Clubs and hypermarket stores as customers increasingly choose omni solutions to meet their shopping needs. Canada comp sales increased more than 10% even as higher levels of inflation are starting to pressure consumer spending in discretionary and general merchandise categories. Flipkart continues to meet our expectations, and the team is gearing up for big billion days. I traveled to India last month and was impressed by how the Flipkart and PhonePe teams are innovating for the customer and driving growth., e-commerce penetration, omni solutions, Canada comp sales, inflation pressure,\\nFlipkart, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, PhonePe continued to see strong growth with annualized TPV of over $830 billion, reaching a record level of monthly transactions of about $3.1 billion. International operating income in constant currency increased more than 28%, partially attributable to the previously mentioned insurance recovery for prior operational disruptions in Chile. Sam\\'s Club had another strong sales quarter with comp up 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of more than 20% on a two-year stack. Transactions increased 9.8%., PhonePe growth, TPV, international operating income, Sam\\'s Club sales,\\ntransactions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, E-commerce sales grew 25%, with strong contributions from both curbside and ship-to-home orders. Membership income was up nearly 9% with another record high quarter in overall member counts and continued growth in Plus member penetration. Sam\\'s added more new members in Q2 than any other quarter in recent years, benefiting from membership campaigns. expenses 131 basis points, including fuel and 72 basis points excluding fuel, due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID costs., e-commerce sales, curbside orders, ship-to-home orders, membership income, Plus member\\npenetration, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, But gross margins were down as elevated markdowns, supply chain, and fulfillment cost, and a 70 basis point inflation-related LIFO charge pressured profitability. As a result, operating income declined about 35%. Now let\\'s turn to guidance. With the updated financial guidance we released last month, we outlined the pressures that led us to take a more conservative outlook for the current year profitability., gross margins, supply chain, fulfillment costs, inflation-related LIFO charge, operating\\nincome, financial guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Let me take a minute to provide you with more detail. When we provided guidance three months ago, we didn\\'t expect food and fuel inflation to accelerate to the levels that we experienced in Q2. In fact, Walmart U.S. food inflation was up double digits year over year, and we saw a nearly 400 basis points step-up as the quarter progressed compared to levels at the end of Q1., food inflation, fuel inflation, Walmart U.S., Q2, guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, The rising cost for essential items and customers\\' reprioritization of spending led to significant mix shifts in our business. Grocery sales mix increased nearly 300 basis points, whereas general merchandise sales mix decreased more than 350 basis points. This resulted in additional general merchandise markdowns in our U.S. business, particularly in apparel at a time when inventory clearance was already higher than expected in the industry., essential items, mix shifts, grocery sales, general merchandise sales, markdowns, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Higher fuel prices also pressured our supply chain expense. We finished the quarter on a strong note, however, and ahead of our updated Q2 guidance provided last month, and the Q3 back-to-school season is off to a solid start. Contributing factors to the better performance included strong sales at the end of the month with good flow-through to the bottom line and lower-than-expected supply chain cost. We\\'re taking additional pricing actions in Q3 to improve inventory levels in the back half of the year, and we built in more conservative category mix assumptions within our guidance., fuel prices, supply chain expense, Q2 guidance, back-to-school season, pricing actions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Our sales and profit view reflects trends we\\'ve seen year to date as well as the uncertainty around inflation and consumer spending in the coming quarters. We\\'ve updated our fiscal year \\'23 guidance to reflect the better Q2 results versus the guidance we provided in July. We continue to believe the sales and profit guidance we provided at the time for the back half of the year appropriately reflects elevated uncertainty in this environment and is our best view of expected performance. For Q3, we expect net sales growth of about 5%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart U.S., sales and profit view, trends, uncertainty around inflation, consumer spending, fiscal year\\n\\'23 guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re expecting operating income to decline 8% to 10% and adjusted EPS to decline 9% to 11%. For fiscal year \\'23, we expect net sales growth of about 4.5%, including comp sales growth of about 4% for Walmart U.S. We expect adjusted operating income and EPS to decline 9% to 11%. Excluding the effect of divestitures, this would translate into net sales growth of 5.5% and a decline in adjusted operating income and EPS of 8% to 10%., operating income, adjusted EPS, fiscal year \\'23, net sales growth, comp sales growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Before I close, I\\'d like to share my perspective as someone that is new to Walmart and meeting many of you for the first time. I\\'m excited to join the company at such an opportunistic and transformational time. Certainly, retail broadly is being pressured right now, but that shouldn\\'t detract from the incredible opportunity that we have in front of us. It starts with our mission of helping people save money so they can live better., opportunistic, transformational, retail broadly, saving money, living better, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We do that every day at a scale that is unmatched by helping people be able to buy the things that they want and they need. This mission permeates our culture in everything that we do. I\\'ve joined an exceptional leadership team. Their history of operational excellence, their strategy, the drive to win is simply something that I wanted to be a part of., mission, culture, leadership team, operational excellence, drive to win, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And you combine that with the resources we have and the investments we\\'re making in things like supply chain automation, improving our e-commerce capabilities and diversifying our portfolio with higher-margin products and services like data and advertising that will result in more durable earnings streams as they scale. We have the potential to not only be relevant in the next chapter of retail but help define it. And when we execute on these things, we have the ability to appreciably increase our shareholder value over time. I believe that some of the best days of Walmart are in front of us., supply chain automation, e-commerce capabilities, higher-margin products and services,\\nshareholder value, best days of Walmart, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 2, John David Rainey, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, I look forward to working with you, and now we\\'d be happy to take any of your questions.

Thank you for joining us to hear about our results. We had a good quarter from a top-line point of view. Sale for the period were ahead of what we expected across all segments, and we\\'re pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q2., good quarter,\\nsales, momentum, Q2, results, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, The bottom line was below our expectations due primarily to three areas that negatively affected operating income in our U.S. businesses, both in Walmart and Sam\\'s Club. Each of these items represents about one-third of our overall profit miss. The first item is wage expense., bottom line,\\nexpectations, operating income, U.S. businesses, wage expense, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, As the omicron variant case count declined rapidly in the first half of the quarter, more of our associates that were out on COVID leave came back to work faster than we expected. We hired more associates at the end of last year to cover for those on leave, so we ended up with weeks of overstaffing. That issue was resolved during the quarter, primarily through attrition. The second item relates to our general merchandise inventory level, primarily in Walmart U.S., omicron\\nvariant, COVID leave, overstaffing, inventory level, attrition, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, GM was a lower percentage of total sales in Q1, resulting in an unfavorable gross margin mix. We also had higher costs for containers and storage, and we\\'ve taken and are taking steps to contain those cost pressures to the first half of this year. The third item is related to fuel costs in our supply chain. So those are the three items., gross margin\\nmix, cost pressures, containers and storage, fuel costs, supply chain, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, And now I\\'ll share more detail on each to help provide clarity. As for wages and staffing in the U.S., we had nearly all associates on COVID leave return in February. We expected the omicron to be steep on the backside, but given that we needed more associates to cover in January, it just took some time over March and April to get wage costs in line with sales. We\\'re now staffed in a way that supports our top-line performance., wages,\\nstaffing, COVID leave, omicron, sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, As it relates to Walmart U.S. general merchandise sales, we knew that we were up against stimulus dollars from last year, but the rate of inflation in food pulled more dollars away from GM than we expected as customers needed to pay for the inflation in food. We like the fact that our inventory is up because so much of it is needed to be in stock on our side counters, but a 32% increase is higher than we want. We\\'ll work through most or all of the excess inventory over the next couple of quarters., Walmart U.S.,\\ngeneral merchandise sales, inflation, inventory, excess inventory, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We started being aggressive with rollbacks in apparel, for example, during Q1. Even with reduced prices, the apparel margin can still be helpful to our overall mix. As we managed the quarter, we generally passed on cost increases from suppliers at the category cost of goods level, but fuel costs accelerated during the quarter faster than we were able to pass them through creating a timing issue. Fuel ran over $160 million higher for the quarter in the U.S., rollbacks,\\napparel margin, cost increases, fuel costs, timing issue, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, than we forecasted. We made progress matching pricing to the increased costs as the quarter progressed. And while we expect some gross margin pressure in Q2, we expect an improvement over Q1. We\\'re not happy with the profit performance for the quarter, and we\\'ve taken action, especially in the latter part of the quarter on cost negotiations, staffing levels, and pricing while also managing our price gaps., gross margin\\npressure, pricing, cost negotiations, staffing levels, profit performance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, While we\\'ve experienced high levels of inflation in our international markets over the years, U.S. inflation being this high and moving so quickly, both in food and general merchandise is unusual. We\\'ll control what we can control, reduce our inventory level and keep prices as low as we can, especially on opening price point food items while improving our profit performance. Inflation is playing a role in the top and bottom line and the pace of change created a timing issue for us in Q1., inflation,\\ninventory, profit performance, pricing, timing issue, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We\\'re adjusting to the mix change and operational costs. Importantly, we expect the solid top-line performance to continue, and we\\'re taking up sales guidance for the year. Customers and members are coming to us for value. I\\'d like to highlight our international team and their performance., top-line\\nperformance, sales guidance, value, international team, operational costs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We had strong top-line performance and managed the quarter very well across the markets. Our biggest international pressure point is related to the COVID lockdowns in China, which created operational and financial pressure. Our teams did a great job of pivoting to serve customers and members through delivery. They stepped up as stores and clubs closed and demand for delivery spiked., top-line\\nperformance, COVID lockdowns, operational pressure, financial pressure, delivery, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, Overall, the International segment had another good quarter. We\\'re making progress executing our strategy. The flywheel we\\'re building is better for customers and members and the more diversified approach to profitability is making the company stronger. We\\'re excited about our newer businesses and our plans to automate much of the supply chain., international\\nsegment, strategy, profitability, supply chain, automation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We\\'re committed to our 4% top-line growth and greater than 4% profit growth algorithm. Our strategy and mid-to long-term financial plans support that despite the turbulence we\\'re managing through today. Globally, we continue to build new mutually reinforcing businesses as we grow in areas like marketplace, that leads to growth in fulfillment services and advertising income. Our B2C relationships lead to complementary B2B relationships, which strengthen our P&L., top-line\\ngrowth, profit growth, strategy, financial plans, businesses, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, The number of marketplace sellers we have continues to grow, and growth in Walmart Connect and Flipkart ads was strong for the quarter. Walmart GoLocal continues to add new partners for our delivery platform, and we\\'ve now reached more than 1,600 delivery points in the U.S. We recently increased the Walmart Plus benefit for fuel to up to $0.10 and expanded the number of participating fuel locations to more than 14,000 including Exxon and mobile stations. Our health and wellness work continues., marketplace\\nsellers, Walmart Connect, Flipkart ads, delivery platform, Walmart Plus benefit, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, In the U.S., we announced an expansion of Walmart Health into Florida with the opening of 40 locations and one more on the way. In India, the launch of Flipkart Health Plus, following our acquisition of online pharmacy platform, SastaSundar.com is enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. The team recently launched the Flipkart Health Plus app which is available on low bandwidth, so it\\'s usable for more people in more cities. And in Canada, we\\'re growing our number of primary care clinics to 87 and in partnership with TELUS Health, we\\'ll launch digital pharmacy services., Walmart Health,\\nFlipkart Health Plus, primary care clinics, digital pharmacy services, affordable care, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We\\'re also making progress with financial services. In India, PhonePe recently processed more than 100 million transactions in a single day, with annualized total payment value of about $770 billion. It\\'s one of the fastest-growing businesses in this space. I also like what we\\'re doing in Mexico with our digital wallet, Cashi., financial\\nservices, PhonePe, transactions, annualized total payment value, digital wallet, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, In the U.S., through our JV with River Capital, we completed the acquisitions of two FinTech businesses, one finance in [Inaudible], and combined those businesses under the one brand. Around the world, we can help our customers and members transact seamlessly, digitally and help them strengthen their lives financially. Now I\\'ll briefly comment on each segment before adds additional detail. In Walmart U.S., our sales performance was ahead of plan, and we continued to gain share in grocery.,  FinTech\\nbusinesses,  acquisitions,  sales performance,  grocery share,  customers and members, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, Inflation is lifting the average ticket, and our transaction count in stores went up slightly versus last year. Overall basket size is up, as you would expect, but units per basket are down a bit. Price leadership is especially important right now and one-stop shopping becomes more than just convenience, people are paying over $4 a gallon for fuel. Overall, e-commerce growth increased about 1% for the quarter., inflation,\\ntransaction count, overall basket size, units per basket, price leadership, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We\\'re making progress on the e-commerce experience as in-stock improves, and the team continues to improve on the app and site experience, delivery accuracy and speed. Our e-commerce operations were affected early in the quarter as we lost one of our largest fulfillment centers to a fire, which created some cost inefficiencies for us. The buildings were destroyed, but thankfully and most importantly, no one was hurt. The loss did put strain on our system, however., e-commerce\\nexperience, in-stock, app and site experience, delivery accuracy, fulfillment centers, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, The team quickly reacted to utilize our stores and spread volume to our other FCs to fulfill e-commerce orders. I\\'m proud of the team for moving so quickly to keep orders flowing to our customers. Moving to Sam\\'s Club U.S., we continue to drive strong comp sales on a one- and two-year basis with strength across most categories. Transactions were up in Q1, overall membership count continued to grow, Plus member penetration reached another all-time high, and we saw good growth in e-commerce.,  team\\nreaction,  e-commerce fulfillment,  Sam\\'s Club sales,  membership growth,  e-commerce\\ngrowth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, Profitability was negatively affected by the areas I mentioned earlier. Walmart International continues to build on the momentum from last year with strong comp sales across markets and strong growth in e-commerce. I\\'ve visited our teams and stores in Mexico and Canada since the first of the year. the progress they\\'re making on building out our flywheel capabilities is impressive., profitability,\\nWalmart International, comp sales, e-commerce growth, flywheel capabilities, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, From financial services and healthcare that I mentioned earlier to marketplace expansion and advertising, the teams are moving quickly. Also like the example from Mexico, where we have a MXN 200 per month unlimited Internet option that\\'s helping customers access the benefits of the digital economy that would otherwise cost them three times that price. In summary, around the world, we\\'re still living in environments with COVID present and navigating the economic and other impacts to deliver for customers and members. As always, our associates are doing a great job, and we\\'re grateful to them.,  financial\\nservices,  healthcare,  marketplace expansion,  advertising,  COVID impacts, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We continue to change and strengthen our company and position it for a strong future. Thank you for your interest in our company. We hope to see you at our annual associate and shareholder celebration in a couple of weeks. As I turn it over to Brett, I want to pause and say a big thank you to him., company\\nstrengthening, annual celebration, Brett\\'s role, interest in company, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, Brett made significant contributions to our company in all parts of our business for many years. He has represented our associates, our investors, and our company so well. His knowledge, astute judgment and character have made him a pleasure to work with. Thank you, partner., Brett\\'s\\ncontributions, company representation, associate representation, investor representation, character, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Doug. In the first quarter, we faced some new challenges as well as some that were more pervasive than anticipated. Of course, we\\'ve been in a very fluid environment for more than two years, and I\\'m proud of the way the company has performed during that time. Q1 sales were strong across all segments and the strength has continued in the start of Q2, reinforcing Walmart wins with customers in even the most unique environments.,  new\\nchallenges,  fluid environment,  Q1 sales,  Q2 sales,  Walmart wins, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, The first quarter was one of the most challenging periods yet related to supply chain disruptions, increased costs and persistently high inflation. There are some things that were unique to the first quarter, like some labor scheduling inefficiency as U.S. associates returned more quickly than expected from COVID-19 leave and some things that will likely be more persistent than anticipated when we gave guidance to start the year. As Doug mentioned, during the quarter, particularly in the middle of the quarter, we weren\\'t able to fully address or pass along some of the cost increases that impacted profit more than expected., supply chain\\ndisruptions, increased costs, persistently high inflation, labor scheduling inefficiency, cost\\nincreases, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re now managing those costs and passing them along more effectively. The costs related to inventory and fuel prices in the U.S. will strike some into Q2, but the scheduling related costs have been mitigated. Most of the increased inventory and related costs were related to buying over the past several quarters with a keen focus on in-stock and now we\\'re in a short period of rightsizing it., cost\\nmanagement, inventory costs, fuel prices, scheduling costs, rightsizing, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, The current sales strength and warmer weather in the U.S. give us confidence in our ability to work through this fairly quickly and strategically. Our market position is strong, and our business model was built to weather times like this when customers are making more real-time choices. We\\'re there for them, and we\\'ll continue to provide great value while managing the business in a way that\\'s also good for shareholders., sales strength,\\nmarket position, business model, customer choices, shareholder value, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'ll continue to reduce costs where we can and manage pricing in a way that preserves competitive price gaps while managing the bottom line and passing on costs where they appear to be less temporary in nature. Our expectations for the top and bottom-line growth algorithm remains structurally unchanged. As we navigate the current environment, we continue to make great progress building our flywheel and executing our long-term strategy. For example, the global advertising business grew over 30% in Q1., cost reduction,\\npricing management, bottom line growth, top-line growth, flywheel execution, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, I\\'m excited about what is ahead and what it means for customers as we more actively engaged with them in different areas of their lives and deepen those relationships. Now let\\'s get into some additional Q1 details. As a reminder, my comments today will exclude the effect of last year\\'s international divestitures. We delivered strong top-line results in the first quarter with total constant currency revenue up more than 6%, reflecting healthy growth in each segment., strong top-line\\nresults, healthy growth, international divestitures, customer relationships, revenue growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Walmart U.S. gained grocery market share and at higher average ticket despite lapping last year\\'s significant benefits from U.S. stimulus. International was led by Mexico and Canada, while Sam\\'s Club U.S., Walmart U.S.,\\ngrocery market share, average ticket, international, Sam\\'s Club U.S., Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, delivered the ninth executive quarter of double-digit comp growth, excluding fuel and tobacco. First quarter gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points versus last year due in part to pressure at Sam\\'s Club from supply chain costs, fuel mix, inflation, and markdowns caused by inventory delays. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate was down 38 basis points with more than three-fourths of the decline related to higher-than-expected supply chain, fuel, and e-commerce fulfillment costs., double-digit\\ncomp growth, gross margin rate, Sam\\'s Club, Walmart U.S., supply chain costs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, While we did see some supply chain improvement early in the quarter, the war in Ukraine and ongoing COVID impacts in various parts of the world, including China led to increased challenges. While sales were ahead of plan in Q1, the category mix in the U.S. was heavier in food and consumables and spending shifted somewhat away from more discretionary items, including categories impacted by unseasonably cool weather such as apparel, patio furniture, and landscaping supplies. We remain very bullish on our food and consumables business., supply chain\\nimprovement, COVID impacts, category mix, sales growth, food and consumables business, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Consumers are feeling inflation pressures as evidenced by an increase in grocery private brand penetration. The category mix shift, along with increased inventory, some of which was delayed in arriving led to higher-than-normal margins for general merchandise. In Q1, unexpected markdowns pressured Walmart U.S. gross profit by about $100 million., inflation pressures, grocery private brand penetration, category mix shift, higher-than-\\nnormal margins, unexpected markdowns, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We expect the inventory position to improve as we go through Q2. SG&A expenses deleveraged 39 basis points, primarily due to increased U.S. wage costs, partially offset by lower total COVID costs versus last year. We expected higher labor costs at Walmart U.S., inventory position, SG&A expenses, deleveraging, U.S. wage costs, COVID costs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, due to the hourly associate wage increase announced last year. As mentioned, Q1 profit declined more than expected with operating income down 20% and adjusted EPS down 20% to $1.30. Operating cash flow was also lower than expected at negative $3.8 billion. This is due to several factors, including higher inventory amounts with about half of the increase due to inflation, lower operating income, and the timing of certain payments and payables due to inventory delays., hourly\\nassociate wage increase, Q1 profit, operating income, adjusted EPS, inventory amounts, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Given our confidence in selling through the inventory, I feel confident about operating cash flow getting back on track as we go through the year. Now let\\'s discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 3% and were up 9% on two-year stack, reflecting strong food sales, which were up low double digits., operating cash flow, segment results, Walmart U.S. comp sales, two-year stack, food sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, As mentioned previously, general merchandise sales were softer but still increased high single digits on a two-year stack. Transactions were flat versus last year, while average ticket increased 3%. e-commerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year as customers continue returning to stores. We\\'re making strong progress in many of our newer higher-margin initiatives., general\\nmerchandise sales, e-commerce sales, transactions, average ticket, higher-margin initiatives, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, The Walmart Connect advertising business continues to scale as we expand self-serve capabilities and offerings. Our new data monetization business, Walmart Luminate, continues to accelerate with over 75% growth quarter over quarter as more supplier partners collaborate with merchandisers to utilize new customer insights in our platform. We also continue to expand our Walmart GoLocal delivery as a service business with new partnerships announced during Q1. In addition, we held grand openings of four new Walmart health centers in Florida and will open another one next month as we continue to expand access to affordable quality care., Walmart Connect, self-serve capabilities, data monetization business, Walmart Luminate,\\ncustomer insights, new supplier partnerships, Walmart GoLocal delivery, new partnerships, grand\\nopenings, affordable quality care, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, One, our strategic fintech partnership with Ribbit Capital, closed on the ONE Finance and even transactions, which sets the foundation for growth. Collectively, these initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next several years. Gross margin pressure and expense deleverage led to a decline in operating income of about 18%. Inventory increased about 33% due to inflation and aggressive inventory buys over the past few quarters., strategic fintech partnership, ONE Finance, transactions, gross margin pressure, expense\\ndeleverage, operating income, inventory increase, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, International sales were strong, up 8% in constant currency, with Mexico and Canada leading the way. e-commerce sales in constant currency grew 22% on top of strong gains last year with growth up 86% on a two-year stack. Comp sales in Mexico increased 9%, with strong growth in stores as well as e-commerce sales, which grew nearly 20% in Q1 and 185% on a two-year stack. In Canada, comp sales were 7.7%, while in China, growth was slower than it\\'s expected, but comps still increased more than 4%, led by e-commerce growth of nearly 90%., international sales, e-commerce sales, constant currency, Mexico, Canada, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Flipkart had another good sales quarter with solid trends in monthly active customers and users. We\\'re also used with the strong growth of PhonePe with annualized TPV of over $750 billion as the team continues to launch new customer offers such as the recent expansion of insurance offerings to include health, auto, and ATV coverage. International operating income at constant currency declined nearly 13%, primarily due to lower gross profit in China, reflecting increased markdowns and higher e-commerce penetration during the quarter as well as investments in e-commerce across the portfolio. Sam\\'s Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of about 21% on a two-year stack., Flipkart, PhonePe, monthly active customers, users, international operating income, Sam\\'s\\nClub, comp sales, excluding fuel and tobacco, two-year stack, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Transactions increased 10% and ticket was slightly positive. e-commerce sales grew 22%. Membership income was up 10.5% with another record in member counts. Operating income was down 20% as the gross margin pressure I mentioned previously was partially offset by higher membership income, fuel profit, and expense leverage., transactions, ticket, e-commerce sales, membership income, operating income, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s turn to guidance, which will be discussed ex divestitures. While we don\\'t typically update guidance at the end of Q1, we felt it was appropriate given the current environment and the profit miss in Q1. We\\'re behind for the year, but we\\'re also just one quarter into the year with time and options in front of us. The team\\'s focus is still on the original profit guidance., guidance, ex divestitures, profit miss, Q1, original profit guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Based on our continuing strong top line, we feel good about our ability to deliver full year sales growth in excess of our original guidance. We now expect consolidated net sales growth, excluding divestitures, to be 4.5% to 5%. We expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of about 3.5% for the year versus the original guidance of slightly above 3%., sales growth, full year sales, net sales growth, Walmart U.S. comp sales, original\\nguidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, However, as a result of the higher-than-anticipated costs we saw in Q1 and the expectation of some of that to continue, growing operating income on our original guidance and more than sales growth is challenging. We now expect operating income and EPS to be relatively flat year on year. As is our usual practice, we\\'ll update you on our progress as we finish Q2. For Q2, we expect net sales growth of over 5%, including comp sales growth of 4% to 5% for Walmart U.S., sales growth, operating income, EPS, net sales growth, Walmart U.S. comp sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2023, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, As our confidence builds in our ability to manage cost increases more efficiently, operating income and EPS are expected to be flat to slightly up. In closing, I\\'m pleased with the top-line momentum we\\'re seeing across the business. While Q1 profit was lower than expected, during this dynamic and challenging environment, I\\'m proud of how our teams continue to be laser-focused on serving customers and taking care of shareholders. Now we\\'d be happy to open up the call for your questions., operating income, EPS, cost increases, profit, customer service, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Dan Binder, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you, Rob.

Let\\'s jump right in. Our team delivered net sales growth of 7.6% and adjusted EPS growth of 9.3%, excluding divestitures. We continued to gain market share in food and consumables in the U.S., and comp transactions were positive., good morning, net sales growth, adjusted EPS\\ngrowth, market share, comp transactions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, Consumer demand during the quarter was strong, and the team overcame a number of challenges in the U.S. and around the world to deliver these strong results. Going into the quarter, we were confident that we had the people, the products, and the prices to deliver. And we did., consumer demand, team, challenges, strong\\nresults, prices, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, Our inventory position improved, and we delivered high sellthroughs in seasonal categories across markets. Food, consumables, and apparel were also strong globally. We comped low single digits in general merchandise in the U.S. against strong results last year., inventory position, sellthroughs, seasonal\\ncategories, food, consumables, apparel, general merchandise, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, And Sam\\'s Club saw broad-based strength across categories in the U.S. and in China. Our merchants are doing a nice job of navigating the pressure from cost of goods inflation with our customers and shareholders in mind. I\\'d like how we\\'re mixing out the business., broad-based strength, categories, merchants, cost of goods inflation, customers, shareholders, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, Consolidated gross profit rate increased 10 basis points for the quarter, including more than 50 basis points in Walmart U.S. We\\'re working closely with our suppliers to manage inflation, finding a few places where we can roll back prices. And we\\'re paying close attention to how we manage our opening price point items. Q4 and the full year are proof points that we can keep our price gaps in the range where we want them, grow market share, and deliver against our top- and bottom-line growth algorithm., consolidated gross profit rate, Walmart U.S,\\nsuppliers, inflation, price gaps, market share, top- and bottom-line growth algorithm, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, Our associates did an amazing job of serving customers and members during this busy season, even as we faced omicron and supply chain challenges. This quarter\\'s COVID leave peak was larger than anything we had experienced in 2020 or previously in 2021. We hired more associates. And our plan called for to help fill that gap, which negatively impacted expenses., amazing job, serving\\ncustomers, omicron, supply chain challenges, COVID leave peak, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, But it was clearly needed. I\\'m grateful to our associates and store and club management teams for how they set priorities on behalf of our customers and members during the quarter. As I visit stores and clubs, it\\'s inspiring to see how our team is navigating such a fluid environment. They\\'re delivering tremendous growth while making significant progress against our longer-term strategy., grateful, associates,\\nstore and club management teams, priorities, fluid environment, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, During the fiscal year just ended, excluding divestitures, we grew net sales by 9%, grew operating profit by 18%, invested $13 billion in capex to grow our business, returned 16 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends, grew advertising business globally to $2.1 billion, and took important steps to build our U.S. financial services capabilities with agreements to make two key acquisitions. Sometimes, it feels like 2020 and 2021 were just one long year. If you look at growth since the beginning of fiscal \\'21 through the end of fiscal \\'22, excluding divestitures, our company is about 17% larger in terms of revenue, 31% larger in terms of operating income, and globally, our percentage of digital sales grew from 6% to 13%., grew net sales, invested\\n$13 billion, returned 16 billion, grew advertising business, built U.S. financial services\\ncapabilities, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, As the company grows, we\\'re fueled by the new business model and flywheel we outlined last year.

It starts with the customer and earning primary destination., fueled, new business model, flywheel, strategy, deliver strategy, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, The big basket stock-up trip is important. It\\'s foundational to our relationship with families. We earn that shopping occasion by running great stores and clubs and offering seamless pickup and delivery experiences, including for our Walmart Plus and in-home members in the U.S. Our membership offering, Walmart Plus, continues to be an important piece of what we\\'re building., big basket stock-up trip, foundational, shopping\\noccasion, running great stores and clubs, seamless pickup and delivery experiences, Walmart Plus\\nmembership offering, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We\\'re adding capacity for pickup and delivery. We increased capacity by nearly 20% last year, and we expect to increase capacity by another 35% this year. For Walmart InHome, we recently announced an expansion of this membership service to make it available to about 30 million homes in the U.S., up from 6 million. To enable the expansion, we\\'re creating roles for more than 3,000 associate delivery drivers., adding capacity, pickup and delivery, increased\\ncapacity, Walmart InHome, membership service, associate delivery drivers, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, The majority of these roles will be filled by existing experienced associates. We\\'ll be building out a fleet of all electric delivery vans to support our delivery services and our goal of a zero emissions logistics fleet by 2040. Our flywheel is designed to serve families more broadly, deepening our relationship with them and creating a healthy mix of merchandise and services for our business.

We can help our customers and Walmart Plus members save money, have an experience with less friction, and help strengthen the financial position for millions of families., operate under ONE brand,\\nJV leadership team, pending acquisitions, save money, reduce friction, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, As with our advertising business, our financial services capabilities cross borders. Our PhonePe business in India is growing incredibly fast. And we have strong capabilities in Mexico, which is such an important market for us. As we look to improve the customer experience and strengthen the mix of our business, expanding our marketplace is important., cross borders, financial\\nservices capabilities, PhonePe business, India, Mexico, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We added more than 20,000 new sellers to the platform in the U.S. last year and expect to add nearly 40,000 more this year. We\\'re now up to nearly 170 million SKUs, and we\\'re adding more every day. We opened up our U.S., add new sellers,\\nplatform, U.S., SKUs, add more, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, marketplace to sellers from India and created a dedicated team there to help sellers onboard and grow.

We grew our U.S. GMV delivered by our Fulfillment Services by 500% last year., India, dedicated team,\\nonboarding, growth, Fulfillment Services, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We expect the robust growth will continue this year as we add more capacity. For Q4, our Fulfillment Services represented 44% of total marketplace orders in India and 22% in Mexico. Growing our marketplace expands choice for our customers, helps our sellers grow, and enhances our profit margins. Our plan for this year includes strengthening the experience for sellers and adding fulfillment capacity so customers have access to more items faster., robust growth, add\\ncapacity, Fulfillment Services, marketplace orders, seller experience, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, It\\'s clear to me that we have years of profitable marketplace and Fulfillment Services growth ahead of us. Staying on the theme of fulfillment and scaling new businesses, we recently launched Walmart GoLocal, a last-mile delivery solution using our Spark Driver platform to help businesses of all sizes reach more customers. GoLocal is making deliveries for the Home Depot and other large retailers. But I\\'m most excited about serving small local retailers., profit growth,\\nFulfillment Services, last-mile delivery, Spark Driver platform, small local retailers, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We have nearly a thousand GoLocal service to pickup points, and we expect to end this year closer to 5,000. This is good for customers, our clients, and for us, as we lower the cost per order by increasing the combined order size and the route density. As we bring more customers, sellers, and suppliers into our ecosystem, it expands our ability to monetize those relationships. A great example is our advertising business., nearly a thousand\\nGoLocal service pickup points, end of year closer to 5,000, lower cost per order, combined order\\nsize, route density, expand ecosystem, advertising business, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, Globally, it\\'s been growing at a high rate with high margins and is now a $2.1 billion business in only a few years. And we expect this strong growth to continue. And as our e-commerce business, including marketplace, continues to grow, so will our advertising business. We\\'re taking the learnings from the U.S., growth, high margins,\\n$2.1 billion business, e-commerce business, advertising business, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, and India and growing in places like Mexico, Canada, and Chile.

We see traction in our core business, as well as in our newer businesses., India, Mexico, Canada,\\nChile, tech platforms, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, There\\'s real power in the ability to make these pieces mutually reinforcing to design them such that one portion of a customer relationship leads them to another because it\\'s easy and intuitive. Connecting B2B opportunities, like advertising, enables us to grow earnings and make key investments at the same time. Because of how the fly wheel is coming together, I feel great about our ability to deliver against the growth algorithm we discussed last year of about 4% top-line growth and operating income growth rates higher than sales. We\\'ve highlighted the increased costs we had in Q4 from COVID, supply chain, and wages, and some of these costs are likely to continue through part of this year., ability to make mutually\\nreinforcing pieces, B2B opportunities, growth algorithm, increased costs, supply chain, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, But I feel confident in the underlying strength of the business and our ability to deliver the growth we expect. The Walmart we\\'re building is becoming more impactful for our customers and members, more digital, more automated, and more diversified on the top and bottom lines. Now, let\\'s move on to our performance by operating segment. I\\'ll begin with Walmart U.S., underlying strength of\\nthe business, growth expected, Walmart U.S., digital transformation, diversification, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, The team had a great holiday season.

But overall, I\\'m really proud of the team for delivering the holiday season, and I believe we\\'ll work our way to an improved in-stock level through the course of the year. Building a seamless omnichannel experience for customers and prioritizing convenience for them is critical. Our stores have become hybrid., cost pressures, in-stock\\nchallenges, team performance, omnichannel experience, store hybridization, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, They\\'re both stores and fulfillment centers. Last year, we increased the number of orders coming from our stores by 170% versus the previous year, and that\\'s on top of more than 500% from the year before. Having inventory so close to so many customers is a competitive advantage. In some cases, we\\'re getting items to customers in hours rather than days., stores, fulfillment\\ncenters, orders, inventory, delivery time, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, In Sam\\'s Club U.S., the momentum continues.

Overall sales were strong again in Q4 with growth of 9.8% in constant currency, excluding divestitures. China, Mexico, and Flipkart led the way.

During Big Billion Days, 40% of sellers were first time sellers on the marketplace, and more than 100,000 kiranas participated by making last-mile deliveries. This is strong inclusive growth. While our omnichannel model gives the gift of time, access and affordability remain important., holidays, festivals,\\nDiwali, Big Billion Days, Chinese New Year, inclusive growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Doug McMillon, President, Chief Executive Officer, Walmart, We\\'re expanding our ecosystem, and we\\'ve made investments in areas such as healthcare, marketplace, telecommunications, and our online food business. A few great examples include the launch of Flipkart Health Plus that aims to increase access to affordable care in India. And the acquisition of Foodmaestro in Canada to build more personalized shopping experiences for customers.

We wrapped up another great year with a strong fourth quarter and good momentum as we start the new year. Over the last couple of years, each quarter has presented unique challenges, but I\\'m proud of how we\\'ve navigated each one of those. The fourth quarter was no different as we faced the rise of omicron with its impact on the supply chain and our associates., strong year, good\\nmomentum, unique challenges, omicron, supply chain, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, This resulted in some significant unexpected expenses.

Sam\\'s growth and membership income has been strong throughout the year as we expand Omni options including club pickup. These and other key initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next few years.

As a reminder, the previously announced international divestitures significantly affect year-over-year comparisons, so my comments today will exclude the effect of divestitures. Total constant currency revenue grew 7.9% to over $153 billion and reached another important milestone with quarterly net sales exceeding $150 billion. Consolidated gross margin rate increased 5 basis points with Walmart U.S., Q4 results,\\ninternational divestitures, revenue growth, consolidated gross margin rate, Walmart U.S., Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, gross margin rate increasing by a healthy 54 basis points, reflecting primarily price management resulting from cost increases in mix, along with benefits from a growing advertising business, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. Supply chain costs were over $400 million higher than expected, but we expect some of those costs to abate overtime. International gross margin rates were lower due primarily to format mix. SG&A expenses deleveraged 19 basis points as increased U.S., gross margin rate, cost increases, price management, supply chain costs, international gross margin\\nrates, SG&A expenses, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower COVID costs versus last year. Although COVID costs were lower than last year, we have significantly higher associate leave costs in the U.S. than anticipated. In the first three quarters combined, COVID leave costs were about $600 million but increased over $450 million just in Q4, presenting an unexpected headwind of over $300 million., wage costs, sales growth, COVID costs,\\nassociate leave costs, U.S., Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Despite these expense challenges, adjusted operating income increased more than 6% and EPS increased more than 9%. We\\'re in a great financial position, enabling us to allocate capital toward both growth and shareholder returns. Free cash flow was $11.1 billion for the year, down versus last year due primarily to inventory build throughout the year, higher capex, and cost increases. We increased share repurchases significantly this year with buybacks of just under $10 billion, a pace we plan to continue or increase in the coming year given our view of the long-term value of the company., adjusted operating\\nincome, EPS, free cash flow, share repurchases, inventory build, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In addition, we announced the 49th consecutive annual dividend increase this morning. ROI increased 90 basis points to just under 15%, the best level in five years due primarily to growth in operating income. Now, let\\'s discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart U.S., dividend increase, ROI, operating income,\\nWalmart U.S., quarterly results, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, had its first ever $100 billion-plus sales quarter with sales of $105 billion. Comp sales grew 5.6%, up more than 14% on a two-year stack. We continue to grow grocery market share as food comps increased high single digits, while health & wellness, apparel, seasonal, and automotive categories were also strong. Transactions were up more than 3% despite COVID pressures., sales growth, comp\\nsales, grocery market share, transactions, COVID pressures, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, E-commerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year, resulting in a 70% two-year stack. We continue to see elevated levels of cost inflation and have taken prudent steps to manage pricing while having slightly wider price gaps than pre-pandemic. We have a good balance of growing market share while managing price with both customers and shareholders in mind. We continue to make strong progress in some of our newer higher margin initiatives., e-commerce sales, cost inflation, pricing,\\nmarket share, price gaps, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Walmart Connect advertising experienced robust sales growth this year with a strong pipeline of new advertisers and large growth opportunities ahead. In fact, the number of active advertisers using Walmart Connect grew more than 130% year over year. And about half of the ad sales came from automated channels in Q4, more than double last year. We expect Walmart Connect to continue to scale over the next few years with plans to become a top 10 ad business in the midterm., Walmart Connect, advertising sales growth,\\nactive advertisers, automated channels, ad sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Growing e-commerce marketplace at WFS have been a priority over the past couple of years as we\\'ve invested to expand fulfillment capacity, introduce new services for sellers, and double the number of items available for customers. In fact, we expect to have over 200 million items in our e-commerce assortment by the end of the year. The expansion of WFS has also been a key unlock in bringing more sellers to Walmart\\'s marketplace. Customers increasingly want home delivery, and we had a six-fold increase in delivery in the fourth quarter versus pre-pandemic levels., e-commerce marketplace, fulfillment\\ncapacity, new services for sellers, item assortment, home delivery, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We continue expanding capabilities, including announcing the acceleration of in-home delivery to 30 million households by year-end. We also announced our new fintech business ONE in January, with the pending acquisitions of fintech platforms ONE Finance and Even. SG&A expenses deleveraged 95 basis points as increased wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower total COVID-related expenses year over year. Still, as I mentioned earlier, COVID leave costs were much higher than expected., in-home delivery, fintech business, ONE\\nFinance, SG&A expenses, COVID leave costs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Operating income grew slightly, aided by strong margins as well as solid growth in membership and other income. Inventory increased about 28% overall, including higher cost of goods due to inflation, mix, and higher-than-normal in-transit shipments, reflecting continued efforts to improve in-stock. International sales were strong, up nearly 10%, led by China, Mexico, and Flipkart as seasonal events, omni growth, and good inventory position contributed to results. E-commerce sales in constant currency grew 21% on top of strong gains last year with growth of more than 75% on a two-year stack., membership, other income, inventory,\\ninternational sales, e-commerce sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, China comps increased nearly 20% in constant currency with continued strength from Sam\\'s Clubs, as well as more than 90% growth in e-commerce sales. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 8% and grew faster than the market according to ANTAD. Flipkart had another good sales quarter, aided by strong holiday events and favorable trends in monthly active customers and users. We\\'re also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe with TPV of more than 130% versus last year with a current run rate of $650 billion., China comps, Sam\\'s Clubs, e-commerce sales,\\nMexico comp sales, Flipkart sales, PhonePe TPV, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In Canada, comp sales were up 4.6%, led by in-store shopping and comps increased more than 13% on a two-year stack. International adjusted operating income in constant currency increased nearly 3%, reflecting lower COVID costs, partly offset by gross margin rate decrease related to higher sales penetration from Sam\\'s China and e-commerce. For the full year, international adjusted operating income grew 12.7%. And we feel confident about our international business as we head into the new year., Canada comp sales, in-store shopping, two-\\nyear stack, international adjusted operating income, gross margin rate, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Sam\\'s Club had another impressive quarter with comps up 10.8%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of nearly 26% on a two-year stack. Transactions increased 7% and ticket was up 3.2%. E-commerce sales grew 21%, and we expanded the rollout of delivery capabilities of digital orders to nearly all clubs during the quarter. Sam\\'s is leveraging Walmart\\'s GoLocal last-mile delivery service to provide more convenience to members., Sam\\'s Club comps, e-commerce sales,\\ntransactions, ticket growth, two-year stack, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Membership income was up more than 9% with another record in member counts and strong Plus penetration. Operating income was up 41% as higher fuel and membership income, as well as strong expense leverage were partially offset by gross margin pressure from inflation and supply chain costs. Now, let\\'s turn to guidance. We feel very good about the underlying strength of the business and believe we can deliver full year growth in FY \\'23 that aligns with the growth algorithm we discussed last year., membership income, operating income, gross\\nmargin pressure, supply chain costs, full year growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, As you saw in Q4, we\\'re still challenged with increased costs related to COVID and supply chain disruptions. Our guidance assumes that we will see some relief from that as the year progresses and that the U.S. consumer remains in a generally favorable economic position throughout the year. The comparisons against last year is unique, primarily due to the timing of international divestitures and U.S., costs related to COVID, supply chain\\ndisruptions, relief from costs, favorable economic position, international divestitures, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, stimulus in FY \\'22. As a reminder, the divestitures of our businesses in the U.K. and Japan were completed near the end of the first quarter last year, contributing about $5 billion in sales and about $0.07 of EPS in Q1, FY \\'22. Our guidance will be ex-divestitures., stimulus, divestitures, U.K., Japan, sales,\\nEPS, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We expect total company sales to increase about 4% with Walmart U.S. comp sales slightly above 3% for the year. Given the timing of stimulus overlaps, we expect about a 1% to 2% comp sales increase from Walmart U.S. in the first quarter, followed by somewhat higher comp sales growth throughout the remainder of the year., total company sales, Walmart U.S. comp\\nsales, stimulus overlaps, comp sales increase, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We expect FY \\'23 total company operating income to increase at a rate slightly higher than sales growth and EPS to grow 5% to 6% versus FY \\'22 adjusted EPS due in part to our aggressive share repurchase program. The quarterly profit growth cadence is expected to be quite variable due to last year\\'s U.S. stimulus, as well as lapping wage investments initiated in February and September 2021. As you would expect, the variability of the quarters looks less extreme when viewed on a two-year stack., total company operating income, EPS growth,\\nshare repurchase program, quarterly profit growth cadence, wage investments, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, We expect Q1 operating income and EPS to be down low double digits to low-teens as we cycle the stimulus effects from last year that resulted in nearly 30% operating income growth, as well as increased wages this year. On a two-year stack, Q1 operating income would still be up a mid-teens percentage. Q2 and Q3 operating income and EPS are expected to increase at low to mid-single digit rates, as year-over-year comparisons ease due in part to the moderation of stimulus benefits last year. We expect higher growth rates in the back half of the year as we fully cycle wage investments, resulting in fourth quarter operating income and EPS increasing by a high-teens percentage., stimulus effects, wages, operating income\\ngrowth, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Q4 operating income will also benefit from some timing versus FY \\'22, particularly in international, as well as cycling elevated COVID leave costs in FY \\'22. Our effective tax rate is expected to increase to 25% to 26% due primarily to earnings mix. For the year, we expect gross margin rates to increase due to pricing, mix, and new business initiatives. Although, there will be variability quarter-to-quarter as is usually the case., t1, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, For the first time in a while, we expect some expense deleveraging as we continue to see elevated supply chain wage and tech costs. We\\'ll continue the multiyear journey of accelerated capital investment focused on increasing fulfillment capacity, automation, and technology to enhance productivity. FY \\'22 capex was about $13.1 billion, lower than anticipated due to timing of projects impacted by supply chain challenges. Due to that and continued investment in strategic priorities, we anticipate this year\\'s capex being at the upper end of the guidance we gave last year of 2.5% to 3% of sales., expense deleveraging, supply chain wage\\ncosts, tech costs, capex, strategic priorities, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In closing, I\\'m really pleased with our FY \\'22 results. I\\'m very confident as I look to this year and to the future. The company is in an enviable position to serve customers and members and also to achieve our financial goals, benefiting shareholders.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com., forward-looking statements, risks and\\nuncertainties, cautionary statement, safe harbor statement, non-GAAP reconciliations, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Dan Binder, Vice President, Investor Relations, It\\'s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon., Doug McMillon, turnover, CEO, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to have momentum. Sales were strong throughout the third quarter and we\\'ve seen a good start to the fourth quarter thanks to all the thoughtful planning and hard work from our associates. In addition to visiting stores and Sam\\'s Clubs in the US this quarter, I also got to visit stores with the Canadian leadership team in the Toronto market. It was a reminder that our associates around the world have served others throughout this pandemic with courage and resilience. Our Canadian stores had some great items for Diwali, we sold through Halloween well. In the seasonal areas, we\\'re ready for Christmas. In the US, we\\'re ready for the holidays too. There is a level of excitement in the year. You can feel it. I\\'ve been walking away from these stores with the recurring thought. We\\'re ready. We have the people, the products and the prices to deliver a great holiday season. Around the world so many families depend on us for food, apparel, home items, TVs and seasonal items like toys and Christmas trees. They trust us to have what they\\'re looking for and at the right price., momentum, sales, fourth quarter, associates,\\nplanning, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, And while this year has its challenges, we\\'re in position to serve them. All segments saw strong top line gains in the quarter, excluding divestitures, and I could not be prouder of our team. They continue to solve problems and move with speed. Walmart US drove a sequential acceleration in comp sales both on a one and two-year basis, and continued to gain market share in grocery. Sam\\'s Club had another very strong quarter, as did Walmart International, with China, Mexico and India leading the way. Customers and members are shopping with us across channels, and we\\'re making it easier for them. Speed matters. That\\'s why we offer fast same-day delivery to millions of customers around the world., strong top line gains, sequential\\nacceleration, comp sales, market share, grocery, channels, fast same-day delivery, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Walmart has served customers across economic cycles for more than 50 years. Each one is unique and they require us to adapt. In this latest cycle, the pandemic caused shifts in how customers and members shopped and what they purchased. The long period of sustained demand for goods has stretched supply chains, resulting in out-of-stocks and inflation. Fighting inflation is in our DNA. Sam Walton loves that fight and so do we. I want to thank our truck drivers, merchants, replenishment teams, our associates that move inventory through the supply chain and our suppliers. They\\'re working together creatively and quickly. We have lots of variables to manage to deliver everyday low prices to customers and simultaneously strong financial results for our shareholders. We continue to make progress on our strategy., fighting inflation, long period of sustained\\ndemand, out-of-stocks, supply chains, creative and quick work, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, The team is moving fast and being aggressive as we build the pieces of our flywheel. In the US, Walmart Go Local for last mile delivery is an example. We\\'re excited to have the Home Depot join Walmart and Sam\\'s Club to share our white label delivery as a service platform. This service is powered by our proprietary driver platform, Spark Driver. The technology behind it is now available in Mexico as we learn to build more digital products that can be leveraged globally. Spark continues to grow and is now active in 900 US cities, providing access to more than 50% of US households. And we\\'re just getting started. We recently enabled a new feature within the Spark Driver app called shopping and delivery, which gives service providers the option to shop and deliver customers\\' orders. So, if delivery slots are full at a location, this feature allows us to serve that demand. The Spark platform has a lot of potential in the US and beyond., Walmart Go Local, last mile delivery, white\\nlabel delivery as a service platform, Spark Driver, technology, digital products, global expansion,\\nshopping and delivery feature, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Selling advertising is another important piece of the flywheel because it helps suppliers and marketplace providers sell more, while creating a new profit opportunity for us. Globally, we continue to see rapid growth in advertising income led by the US, Flipkart and Mexico. We\\'re also making good progress at PhonePe, and we\\'re starting to ramp in Canada and Chile. Beyond advertising income, we\\'re creating new ways to gather and analyze data to fuel smarter, faster decision-making to better serve customers, members and suppliers. Earlier this quarter, we launched Walmart Luminate in the US, which is a new suite of data products created for our merchants and suppliers to reveal actionable category and item inside. Our sales team is getting started, and we\\'re encouraged by the number of suppliers that have already signed up and their feedback., advertising income, rapid growth, data\\nproducts, Walmart Luminate, actionable category, sales team, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our work to become a regenerative company continues. We had an offsite recently with over 50 of our leaders from several countries to imagine what more we can do and how we can pick up speed., regenerative company, offsite, leaders,\\nimagining, speed, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Environmental, social and governance issues are important to us, and we\\'re committed to continuing our leadership. In September, we issued our first ever green bond at $2 billion. It is one of the largest yet from a US-based company. Proceeds are to be used to fund projects like renewable energy, high performance buildings and zero waste. While we\\'ve been investing in environmental sustainability projects for years, the size and design of this bond is aligned with the bold commitments we\\'ve more recently made. We hosted our Sustainability Milestone Meeting in October. Many of our suppliers, NGO partners and associates attended. We shared a new goal at the meeting to achieve a 15% absolute reduction of our virgin plastic footprint by 2025. We think this goal and others announced at the meeting will move our business in a direction that is good for the planet and good for business by giving our customers the things they love without things they don\\'t., green bond, environmental sustainability\\nprojects, renewable energy, high performance buildings, zero waste, virgin plastic footprint,\\nSustainability Milestone Meeting, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now let\\'s move on to segment results. I\\'ll begin with Walmart US. Comp sales of 9.2% or 15.6% on a two-year stack is remarkable growth. The gains we\\'ve seen in market share for grocery and strong back to school results indicate our inventory position has improved. Prices and assortment are compelling, and customers continue to move away from early pandemic behaviors. We see tailwinds in our results. A strong consumer, a degree of inflation and government stimulus are all factors. But I also like what I see in the core of the business. Transaction counts in our stores and clubs are growing; inventory is up 11.5%; our price gaps or where we want them; and we\\'re innovating in the supply chain and adding capacity. And we\\'re building businesses like Walmart Go Local, Walmart Connect, Walmart Luminate, Walmart Plus, Spark delivery, our Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services. Financial services is another area where we know we can make a difference in the lives of so many. We recently launched bill payment services in our stores as well as the ability to load money to a bank account or a prepaid card., remarkable growth, market share, inventory\\nposition, prices and assortment, government stimulus, transaction counts, price gaps, supply chain\\ninnovation, building businesses, financial services, bill payment services, loading money, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Moving to Sam\\'s Club US. Comp sales were strong at 13.9%, excluding fuel. Membership is the lifeblood of the club model. Growth in membership income of 11.3% is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Membership count reached a new record high during the quarter. And overall renewal rates were strong across the board, including first-year renewals and those for Plus members. Both individual and business members are shopping with us across channels and using the digital tools we\\'ve developed. The new Don\\'t Forget function with Scan and Go is a great example. It\\'s a completely digital way for us to help members and drive basket size at the same time. Based on a member\\'s shopping history, we can target items that a member may be forgetting in their trip all through the app, and we already see an increase in the number of items in the basket. We\\'re also expanding delivery options at Sam\\'s. We now offer same-day delivery for 440 clubs using our Spark Driver network., membership income, membership count, renewal\\nrates, digital tools, Don\\'t Forget function, Scan and Go, basket size, delivery options, same-day\\ndelivery, Spark Driver network, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to Walmart International. We had another quarter of strong growth, with sales up 10.3% and profit up even higher at 17.5%, excluding divestitures and currency. We ended the quarter in great shape on inventory and price gaps. Back to school and other fall celebrations helps drive traffic for us as families began to get back to normal shopping patterns. The festive season is off to a strong start with Big Billion Days in India. We continue to see strong growth in e-commerce. On a two-year stack, sales increased 91%, led by Flipkart and China. We\\'ve talked about the importance of omnichannel globally, and we continue to see the buildout of these models across markets. Our small Sam\\'s Club depots that extend the reach of our large clubs in China helped deliver e-commerce growth of 96%, with incredibly fast delivery for everyday items., strong growth, inventory, price gaps, back\\nto school, fall celebrations, e-commerce, omnichannel, small Sam\\'s Club depots, fast delivery, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In Mexico, we continue to expand same-day delivery and express delivery orders quickly reach customers using crowdsourcing capabilities. And in both Mexico and Canada, the expansion of omni capabilities is driven by technology that we\\'ve developed to share across markets, further leveraging our scale. Our international markets are building flywheels that have common characteristics with each other and with the US which helps us innovate and leverage the technology we\\'re building. Our store and club formats are well positioned. We\\'re moving quickly to add and expand more digital businesses, including e-commerce and payments, to create new business models. We\\'re innovating for our customers like the recent expansion of Flipkart SuperCoins across platforms. We\\'re also making important investments for the future while delivering profitable growth today. You see examples of these investments in our supply chain in India and Mexico, new clubs in China and store remodels in Canada. The team is delivering on its purpose of driving long-term sustainable growth for the Company., same-day delivery, express delivery,\\ncrowdsourcing, omni capabilities, technology development, store and club formats, digital\\nbusinesses, e-commerce, payments, supply chain, investments, sustainable growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, With that, I\\'ll close today by thanking our associates around the world for what they do each day to serve our customers and drive results. The holiday season is here and we\\'re ready. Our teams have been working hard to ensure we have the people, the products and the prices that will help make this season special for everyone., associates, customers, results, holiday\\nseason, teams, people, products, prices, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In the third quarter, momentum continued with strong sales and profit growth in each of our segments while continuing to accelerate our strategic priorities. We\\'re off to a good start for the holiday season and in good position to continue delivering strong results. Despite the various macro and industry challenges, our inventory position is good. Stores and fulfillment centers are well-staffed and our price position remains strong. Customers should expect to find the items they want at great values, and we are ready to serve them however they want to shop. Our omni model is a substantial competitive advantage as shopping behaviors continue to evolve. Customers want choices in how they shop and our unique set of assets with a network of stores, expanding digital capabilities, robust distribution networks and innovative services very effectively serve their evolving needs. Walmart US comp sales grew 9.2%, including nearly 6% growth in transactions, with in-store shopping leading the way. E-commerce sales growth was up 8% in Q3 against strong sales gains last year, resulting in an 87% two-year stack. We continue to see strong market share gains in grocery this year as well as unit share gains on a two-year stack., momentum, sales growth, profit growth,\\nstrategic priorities, holiday season, inventory position, price position, omni model, shopping\\nbehaviors, Walmart US comp sales, e-commerce sales, market share gains, grocery market share, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sam\\'s Club had another outstanding quarter with comp sales growth, excluding fuel, of 15.5%, including more than 10% growth in transactions and 32% growth in e-commerce. Membership counts had another record high and renewal rates remained strong., comp sales growth, transactions, e-commerce,\\nmembership counts, renewal rates, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, International results were impressive, including e-commerce penetration of around 19% as omni services scale across key markets. For example, Canada has expanded online grocery pick up from stores nationwide, while in Mexico, customers\\' express delivery orders can be shipped via gig drivers in under 90 minutes from 120 stores. We continue to make good progress on accelerating the flywheel. We\\'re seeing increased contributions from growth businesses such as advertising, e-commerce marketplace and Spark last mile delivery. Our delivery reach is expanding and our scale enables us to monetize this capability by offering same day services to other merchants through our Walmart Go Local\\'s B2B initiative., e-commerce penetration, omni services,\\nonline grocery pick up, express delivery, gig drivers, flywheel, growth businesses, advertising,\\ne-commerce marketplace, Spark last mile delivery, Walmart Go Local\\'s B2B initiative, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s discuss Q3 results. As a reminder, the previously announced international divestitures significantly affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments today will focus on the underlying business, excluding the effect of divestitures. Also COVID costs remained elevated globally, although lower than last year in most markets. In addition, EPS includes a $0.67 negative effect from premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. Total constant currency revenue grew more than 10% to over $139 billion. Walmart US comp sales momentum remained strong; up 15.6% on a two-year stack, due in part to strong US consumer spending and some inflation. Strength in China, Mexico and India led to international sales growth of more than 10% in constant currency. Strong trends at Sam\\'s Club continued with comp growth of nearly 31% on a two-year stack, excluding fuel and tobacco. Currency benefited sales by about $1.3 billion. Gross margin rate declined 51 basis points due primarily to increased supply chain costs and headwinds from fuel mix in the US segments as well as format mix shifts in International. However, total gross margin dollars grew 9.6%. SG&A expenses leveraged 13 basis points, reflecting strong sales and lower COVID costs, partially offset by increased wage investments in the US. As a result of these investments, we\\'ve seen a great response to our holiday hiring programs, with the addition of over 200,000 new store and supply chain associates. Operating income on a constant currency basis was up 6.3%, leading to adjusted EPS of $1.45. As anticipated, free cash flow for the year is about $8 billion lower than last year, primarily reflecting inventory increases and higher capex. We repurchased $2.2 billion of stock in Q3 and $7.4 billion year-to-date, up significantly from last year. I\\'m pleased with the improvements in ROI, even as we\\'ve made strategic investments, with reported ROI increasing 80 basis points to 14.5%, which is among the best level in four years., Revenue growth, International sales, Supply\\nchain costs, Store associates, Stock repurchase, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart US had another good quarter, aided by strong consumer spending, stemming in part from government stimulus and inflation. Strong sales trends were led by grocery, health and wellness and apparel. Back to school categories also performed well, along with automotive and holiday decor. We\\'re pleased with the strong momentum in the grocery business as our strong price positioning and omni offerings resonate with customers. Grocery sales were up nearly 10% as strong unit growth and low to mid single digit inflation benefited results. In fact, food sales grew $3.6 billion during Q3, which is the strongest quarterly growth in six quarters., Grocery sales, Strong momentum, Price positioning, Omni\\nofferings, Food sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re continuing to enhance and scale our strategic growth businesses. Both national and local partners have shown strong interest in our new Walmart Go Local business, while the Spark Driver platform continues to expand nationally. Walmart Connect advertising sales have increased nearly 240% on a two-year stack, and in Q3, we launched a new demand side platform in partnership with the Trade Desk to expand offsite media offerings. We also added around 21 items to our e-commerce marketplace assortment during the quarter, significantly increased the number of items available for expedited delivery and saw continued strong growth in Walmart Fulfillment Services\\' penetration., Strategic growth, Walmart Go Local, Spark Driver, Walmart\\nConnect, E-commerce marketplace, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walmart US gross profit rate declined 12 basis points, reflecting increased supply chain costs. We\\'re seeing inflationary cost pressures in some areas, and our merchants remain laser focused on taking the necessary steps to mitigate supply chain congestion while working with suppliers in monitoring price gaps to manage margins appropriately. Lower markdowns and increased contributions from advertising revenue have helped offset cost pressures. SG&A expenses deleveraged 20 basis points due primarily to investments and wages. But operating income was strong, up almost 6%. Inventory increased 11.5% in preparation for what we expect to be a strong holiday season. The steps taken to mitigate transit and port delays have positioned us well, including adding extra lead time to orders, chartering vessels for Walmart goods, rerouting deliveries to less congested ports and expanding overnight hours at key US ports., Supply chain costs, Gross profit rate, Inflationary cost\\npressures, SG&A expenses, Holiday season, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, International had a great quarter, with double-digit sales growth, strong momentum in e-commerce across key markets and operating profit growth outpacing sales. E-commerce sales in constant currency grew 33% on top of strong gains last year, with growth in China, Flipkart and Mexico particularly strong. We\\'ve nearly doubled e-commerce sales in international over the past two years, and it\\'s encouraging that our ecosystem is expanding and developing in areas such as digital advertising., Double-digit sales growth, Strong momentum, E-commerce\\nsales, Operating profit growth, International markets, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, China comps were quite strong in Q3, increasing 16.5% with continued strength from Sam\\'s Club as well as more than 90% growth in e-commerce sales. During the mid-autumn festival, sales were terrific and we saw an acceleration in omni performance with nearly all hypermarkets setting online sales records during this event. Flipkart had another good quarter, with strong sales growth and favorable trends in monthly active customers and users. In anticipation of the holiday season, the team has doubled fulfillment capacity versus last year, with dozens of new fulfillment center locations, more than 1,000 last mile delivery hubs, and expanded relationships with Toronto partners to handle a large percentage of last mile deliveries. Comp sales in Mexico increased 6% and grew faster than the market according to ANTAD, with strong consumer spending on categories related to back to school and seasonal celebrations. Customer adoption of omni offerings continue to grow, and we\\'re seeing a strong response to the launch of Walmart Fulfillment Services with one-fourth of Marketplace sales fulfilled through this network. In Canada, comp sales were up 6% and increased more than 13% on a two-year stack. Seasonal sales events were especially strong and omni sales continued to increase. Online grocery is now available in nearly all stores, and we\\'ve launched Express pickup within two hours in a couple of stores in Toronto. International operating income at constant currency increased 17.5%, reflecting strong sales and expense leverage., China comps, Flipkart, Omni performance, Holiday season,\\nInternational operating income, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sam\\'s Club continued to deliver excellent results, with strong growth in sales, membership and profit. Membership income was up more than 11% as we achieved another record in member counts, strong renewal rates and increased Plus member penetration. Sam\\'s operating income was up more than 10% as strong membership income and expense leverage more than offset gross margin pressure from supply chain costs, fuel and inflation., Strong growth, Membership income, Operating income, Supply\\nchain costs, Gross margin pressure, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s turn to guidance. We anticipate Q4 Walmart US comp sales, excluding fuel, increasing around 5%, resulting in over 6% gain for the full year. Annual adjusted EPS is expected to be around $6.40 for the year, representing 17% growth. We continue to make good progress on our capital investments, but we now anticipate the timing of some investments originally planned for this year will flow into next year. As a result, we expect full year capex to be around $13 billion versus our original guidance of $14 billion., Q4 Walmart US comp sales, Annual adjusted EPS, Capital\\ninvestments, Full year capex, Timing of investments, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In closing, I\\'m very encouraged by the Q3 results, and I\\'m optimistic about Q4. I continue to be very excited about the evolution of Walmart into a one of a kind omnichannel company., Q3 results, Q4, Omnichannel company, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 3, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you for your interest this morning.

Results for the second quarter were strong. Excluding divestitures, we saw revenue growth of 7.6% in constant currency, leveraged expenses and grew operating income ahead of sales at 24.1% in constant currency., Good morning, Results, Revenue growth, Expenses, Operating\\nincome, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Recent quarters have demonstrated more than ever that our omnichannel strategy is the right one as we serve customers regardless of how they want to shop. There are occasions when people want to visit a store, times when they want to pick up and times when they want to have it delivered. We\\'re going to keep innovating and executing to get better at all three as our diversified omni model positions us well to gain share in high-growth markets around the world., Omnichannel strategy, Serving customers, Innovating and\\nexecuting, Diversified omni model, Gaining share, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, I want to thank our associates for the work they did to deliver these results. They continue to step up and serve others in an inspiring way., Thank, Associates, Work, Results, Serve, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Since the pandemic began, we\\'ve been clear that our priority is the safety of our associates and those who shop with us. We think it\\'s important that as many people in the U.S. get vaccinated as soon as possible and vaccines be made widely available around the world. As the Delta variant spread and as the potential for future variants persists, we made the decision to require our U.S. teams, above store and club level, to become fully vaccinated by October 4. At the same time, we doubled the cash incentive to get vaccinated for hourly associates in the U.S. to $150. We\\'re grateful to those associates that are already vaccinated., Safety, Vaccination, Pandemic, Delta variant, Incentive, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'m confident in the fundamental strength of our business even as we navigate the benefits from economic stimulus in the U.S. for both this year and last year. We\\'ve proven our ability to serve customers in challenging environments and across multiple channels, formats and countries. The phrase, \"Serving customers\", has traditionally meant one thing at Walmart, but today, it includes serving marketplace sellers, our advertising partners and those that want to use our fulfillment services or proprietary software., Serving customers, Economic\\nstimulus, Channels, Formats, Countries, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our advertising business in the U.S., Walmart Connect, nearly doubled during the quarter versus last year, with active advertisers up more than 170%. And this isn\\'t confined to the U.S. We\\'re growing ad businesses in Mexico, India, Canada and most recently in Chile. Our fulfillment services for marketplace sellers continues to scale too. We\\'re on-track to hit full year double-digit GMV penetration by year-end., Advertising business, Walmart\\nConnect, Active advertisers, Fulfillment services, Marketplace sellers, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also announced during the quarter that we\\'ll serve other businesses through certain in-house technologies used for pickup and delivery. Our partnership with Adobe is an example of that. These are a few examples of how we\\'re using our assets to scale new businesses within the company and build new streams of revenue and profit., Serving other businesses, In-house\\ntechnologies, Partnership with Adobe, Scaling new businesses, Building new streams of revenue and\\nprofit, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our tech and product teams have made a lot of progress modernizing our technology and way of working. We\\'re starting to see the fruit generated by their efforts as we build innovative solutions that have utility across the enterprise., Modernizing technology, Building innovative solutions, Enterprise, Utility, Progress, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re starting to see more examples of where one idea or one tech product can benefit more of our businesses and faster. Cloud-powered checkout comes to mind. This technology enables seamless experiences for customers and associates like mobile Check Out With Me, Scan & Go and Self-Checkout. More than 30 applications across five countries are leveraging cloud-powered checkout for retail transactions., Cloud-powered checkout, Seamless\\nexperiences, Mobile Check Out With Me, Scan & Go, Self-Checkout, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Things like building a 360-view of the customer using machine learning is important for our business in the U.S., but it\\'s also important in other markets. That\\'s why we\\'re now leveraging this technology in Mexico and in Central America. The Ask Sam app that you\\'ve heard us talk about was originally built for Sam\\'s Club associates. Now the same concept has been adapted for use in supercenters. It helps our associates be more productive and better serve customers. I\\'m really pleased about the work our tech teams are doing to unlock value across the business., Building a 360-view of the customer,\\nLeveraging machine learning, Ask Sam app, Unlocking value across the business, Tech teams, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now let\\'s move on to segment results. I\\'ll begin with Walmart U.S. The underlying business is strong, even as we navigate the many effects of the pandemic as well as government stimulus this year and last year. Customer behaviors changed during the quarter as people were shopping with us more in stores than online. As that shift occurred, we gained market share in grocery. Even as eCommerce growth slowed, as we layered on top of tremendous growth last year, we feel good about our two-year stacks of comp sales and eCommerce growth. The good news for us is that we can serve them either way. And of course, they get to choose., Walmart U.S., Pandemic, Government\\nstimulus, Customer behaviors, eCommerce growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also saw nearly triple-digit growth in advertising sales through Walmart Connect and added thousands of new sellers on our eCommerce marketplace during the quarter. I like the progress we\\'re making with Walmart Fulfillment Services too.

This will mean additional capacity and automation from our largest fulfillment centers to our stores. These investments are aimed at increasing assortment to broaden our appeal with customers and get product positioned and picked efficiently to deliver it faster. These investments will increase capacity, help support the growth of Walmart+ and improve productivity., Supply chain, Capex spending,\\nAssortment, Product positioning, Productivity, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, From a merchandising point of view, we launched new private brands in healthcare and pet categories.

They also have strength in so many key metrics, including our most important membership metrics. We saw that story continue this quarter with membership income growth of 12.2%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth., Sam\\'s Club, Membership metrics,\\nMembership income growth, Key metrics, Quarterly growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Total membership counts are a record high and overall renewal rates, and those for Plus members continue to be strong.

Excluding divestitures, net sales increased nearly 13% in constant currency. eCommerce continues to play a bigger role for us. Net sales penetration for eCommerce was about 19% in Q2, an increase of more than 700 basis points from last year., t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re strengthening our omnichannel approach in Mexico, China and Canada. In Mexico, we launched Walmart Pass, a membership model where customers get unlimited same-day delivery from stores, completed the rollout of Scan & Go to all Sam\\'s Clubs, added new sellers to the marketplace and grew our online SKU count by 30%., Omnichannel approach, Membership\\nmodel, Same-day delivery, Marketplace sellers, Online SKU count growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, China had a particularly strong quarter, with growth in eCommerce of 75%.

This team has been busy. They introduced Flipkart Camera, a first-of-its-kind technology at scale for the Indian customer that allows users to view products in their physical environment, expanded their grocery business to over 70 cities and launched a new commerce platform called Shopsy to help reach the reseller community. They\\'re also increasing customer stickiness with Flipkart Plus. It\\'s a tiered program based on spend that helps us drive higher repeat rates. Customers in the program transact more frequently and we see lower churn than others. They also recently completed a new funding round, which placed a value on the business of about $38 billion, significantly higher than the valuation when we invested just three years ago. There were large votes of confidence from a strong group of investors, and we\\'ll put those dollars to work to deliver growth in key areas such as grocery, fashion and our supply chain., Flipkart, GMV growth, Technology,\\nGrocery business, Customer stickiness, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, You should see the common threads and leverage points across our businesses. Increasingly, we think about global businesses and global tech products rather than thinking or working a country at a time. There\\'s more of a digital-first mindset here., Common threads, Leverage points,\\nGlobal businesses, Digital-first mindset, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Before I close today, I\\'d like to remind everyone of the new ESG report we published last month. I encourage you to invest time with each of the briefs to understand our priority issues along with the progress we\\'re making against our commitments. For example, on emissions, we\\'ve reduced absolute Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by more than 17% since 2015. Our original target was 18% by 2025. The tremendous progress we\\'ve made means we\\'re on-track to achieve the updated target we announced of a 35% reduction by the same date. Additionally, our suppliers report having avoided more than 186 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2020 for a cumulative total of more than 460 million metric tons avoided since we started Project Gigaton in 2017., ESG report, Emissions reduction,\\nGreenhouse gas emissions, Suppliers\\' emissions avoidance, Project Gigaton, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, I also want to take a moment to mention an announcement we made on July 27 regarding the Live Better U education program. Walmart will now pay 100% of college tuition and books for associates as part of our commitment to invest nearly $1 billion over five years in career training and development. This means that roughly 1.5 million full- and part-time associates in the U.S. can earn a college degree or learn other skills without the burden of debt. This is a fantastic initiative, giving our associates the opportunity to learn and grow., Live Better U education program,\\nCollege tuition, Books, Career training, Associates\\' growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'ll close by thanking our associates for how they serve others and our leadership team for their vision and ability to lead so much positive change so quickly. They built us into a global leader in omnichannel retailing with a model that is uniquely Walmart. Our team is designing with the customer at the center of our flywheel, which is coming together nicely. It\\'s exciting to imagine how far we can go., Associates, Leadership team,\\nOmnichannel retailing, Customer-centered design, Flywheel, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Doug. Our strong second quarter and the solid start to the third quarter position us to deliver a great year of financial results while making steady progress against our strategic priorities. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of the omni strategy, providing customers with new products, services and tools. No matter how customers want to shop, we\\'re here for them., Strong financial results,\\nOmnichannel strategy, Customer satisfaction, Progress against strategic priorities, Third quarter\\nperformance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In some periods, in-store shopping will lead the way, and in some, eCommerce will lead the way. While we\\'re always striving for more in each part of the flywheel, I\\'m pleased with the overall growth of the business. In Walmart U.S., comp sales grew 5.2% and transactions grew more than 6% as customers are returning to the convenience of one-stop, in-store shopping. eCommerce sales grew 6% in Q2 and 103% on a two-year stack., In-store shopping, eCommerce growth,\\nComp sales growth, Transactions growth, Flywheel, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We continue to build a very sizable eCommerce business around the world. In fact, we\\'re on-track to deliver $75 billion in global eCommerce sales this year and on our way to $100 billion in the near term. We\\'re also seeing continued strong U.S. market share gains in grocery, which is a key part of our business., eCommerce sales, Global sales,\\nMarket share gains, Grocery sales, U.S. market, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sam\\'s Club members are increasingly utilizing curbside pickup for online orders and the adoption of Scan & Go technology in club is at an all-time high. The success of Scan & Go at Sam\\'s is one of the reasons we included this as part of the Walmart+ offering. In international, eCommerce penetration is now at nearly 19% of sales, and we\\'re rapidly expanding omni services in key markets such as Mexico., Sam\\'s Club, Curbside pickup, Scan &\\nGo technology, Walmart+, eCommerce penetration, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re also rapidly expanding higher-margin businesses like advertising, data monetization and eCommerce marketplace, which gives us flexibility to invest aggressively for the future while growing profit near term. These businesses are in different places along the maturity curve, but we\\'re scaling them., Advertising, Data Monetization, eCommerce Marketplace, Growth, Profit, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For example, Walmart Connect U.S. advertising sales nearly doubled in Q2, and we expect the rapid growth to continue. While businesses like our new Fintech JV are still in a start-up phase, we know the opportunities are significant, and we\\'ll share more in the coming quarters., Advertising, Growth, Fintech JV, Opportunities, Share, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s discuss Q2 results. As a reminder, the previously announced international divestitures significantly affect year-over-year comparisons, so my comments today will focus on the underlying business, excluding the effect of divestitures. In addition, the pandemic continues to create both tailwinds and headwinds for the business. U.S. government stimulus benefited sales this year and last year, but many international markets continue to be negatively affected by COVID and related government operating restrictions. COVID costs remained elevated, but significantly lower than last year., Underlying Business, International Divestitures, Pandemic, Government Stimulus,\\nCOVID Costs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Total constant currency revenue growth was strong, up 7.6% to more than $138 billion, with strength across all reporting segments. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased more than 5% in Q2 and more than 14% on a two-year stack basis. International sales growth was strong, up nearly 13% in constant currency, with strength in India, Mexico and China, while Sam\\'s Club comp sales grew more than 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco.

We repurchased $2.4 billion of stock in Q2 and $5.2 billion year-to-date, which is up significantly from last year. This is one of the largest quarters for buybacks over the past two years, demonstrating our financial strength and belief in the value of our company., Free Cash Flow, Inventory Increases, Stock Repurchase, Financial Strength, Company\\nValue, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart U.S. had another strong quarter. Underlying business trends continue to be solid, including strong grocery market share gains, according to Nielsen, and an acceleration of store traffic. In fact, comp sales increased each month through the quarter and we\\'re off to a good start with the back-to-school season. On top of extraordinarily strong growth last year, eCommerce sales were up 6% and have more than doubled over the past two years., Walmart U.S., Grocery Market Share, Store Traffic, eCommerce Sales, Back-to-School\\nSeason, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Strong sales trends were led by grocery, health and wellness and apparel as well as reopening categories such as automotive, travel and party supplies. Grocery sales were up 6%, including the benefit from modest ticket inflation and increased low double digits on a two-year stack basis. That results in $2.4 billion of growth in food sales year-over-year and about $5.5 billion of growth on a two-year stack., Strong Sales Trends, Grocery Sales, Health and Wellness, Apparel, Reopening\\nCategories, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Strong price positioning, great fresh quality and improved in-stocks are driving results. We\\'re excited about the traction we\\'re seeing in strategic growth businesses. Walmart Connect sales roughly doubled in Q2 versus last year as we ramp up new advertisers. The Spark Driver platform continues to grow, supporting last-mile deliveries from stores. Over the past 12 months, we\\'ve doubled Spark\\'s coverage to more than 500 cities nationwide, providing access to more than 20 million households. Our eCommerce Marketplace is also expanding, and we expect to make hundreds of thousands of additional items available for fulfillment services this year alone. The Walmart business model is evolving, and these newer businesses are contributing to results in a more meaningful way., Strong Price Positioning, Great Fresh Quality, Improved In-Stocks, Walmart Connect\\nSales, Spark Driver Platform, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walmart U.S. gross profit rate improved 20 basis points with lower markdowns and strong advertising revenue, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. Margins were also helped by administering COVID vaccines this year and lapping last year\\'s COVID-related closures of Vision and auto care centers., Gross Profit Rate, Markdowns, Advertising Revenue, Supply Chain Costs, COVID\\nVaccines, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re continuing to see a bit more cost inflation than normal, but our merchants are working with suppliers and monitoring price gaps to keep prices low while managing margins. Operating income was strong, up about 12% on an adjusted basis. Inventory increased 20% due to lapping COVID-related inventory effects last year and strong sales growth this year., Cost Inflation, Price Gaps, Operating Income, Inventory Effects, COVID-Related\\nInventory, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We continue to monitor industry trends related to transit and port delays. Our merchants continue to take steps to mitigate challenges, including adding extra lead time to orders and chartering vessels specifically for Walmart goods. Out-of-stocks in certain general merchandise categories are running above normal, given strong sales and supply constraints., Industry Trends, Transit Delays, Port Delays, Out-of-Stocks, Supply Constraints, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, International had a great quarter with strong sales and profit growth. Net sales grew nearly 13% in constant currency, including strength in India, Mexico and China. It\\'s encouraging to see the continued progress of our large and growing eCommerce business in our markets. eCommerce sales grew 86% and penetration accelerated more than 700 basis points to nearly 19% of constant currency sales., Strong Sales Growth, Profit Growth, Net Sales, eCommerce Business, eCommerce\\nSales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Comp sales in Mexico increased 4.7% as the omnichannel strategy continues to accelerate.

Sales growth was strong even as they dealt with COVID, and we continue to see improving trends in monthly active customers and users. We were excited to take another step to position the Flipkart Group for future growth with the completion of a $3.6 billion funding round in July that included strong representation from external financial investors valuing the business at nearly $38 billion., Flipkart, Sales Growth, Monthly Active Customers, Users, Funding Round, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In Canada, COVID-related government restrictions on the sale of nonessential categories like apparel and general merchandise pressured sales and profitability, but we\\'re optimistic that we\\'ll see a more normalized sales and profit environment in the back half., COVID-Related Government Restrictions, Sales Pressure, Profitability, Normalized\\nSales Environment, Back Half, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, China comps increased 2.9% and were up 11.6% on a two-year stack, and eCommerce penetration has now reached more than 25% of sales in China. International operating income was strong, increasing about 28%, reflecting sales strength, the benefit from lapping last year\\'s discrete tax item and lower COVID costs.

Sam\\'s operating income was up 11.5%., Strong Growth, Sales, Membership, Profit, Operating Income, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s turn to guidance. We\\'re closely monitoring the evolving COVID impacts around the world. Guidance discussed today assumes a continued strong U.S. economy with no new significant government stimulus for the remainder of the year. All of the guidance discussed excludes the impact of international divestitures., COVID Impacts, Economy, Government Stimulus, International\\nDivestitures, Guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We now anticipate higher full year sales growth due to the strong first half performance and an expected good back half of the year, with consolidated net sales growth expected to be up 6% to 7% versus prior guidance of a low- to mid-single-digit increase. Walmart U.S. comp sales are expected to increase 5% to 6%, representing about $20 billion of growth. We anticipate Sam\\'s Club comps to increase 7.5% to 8.5%, excluding fuel and tobacco, and international constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8%., Full Year Sales Growth, First Half Performance, Back Half, Walmart U.S. Comp\\nSales, Sam\\'s Club Comps, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re also raising full year guidance for operating income and EPS. On a constant currency basis, we expect full year consolidated adjusted operating income to increase 11.5% to 14%, which is a material step-up from our prior guidance of high single-digit growth and an even more significant increase from our initial guidance in February. Walmart U.S. adjusted operating income is expected to increase 11% to 13.5%. Full year adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.35. This is an increase from prior guidance of low double-digit growth as well as above the initial guidance of flat to up slightly., Full Year Guidance, Operating Income, EPS, Walmart U.S.,\\nAdjusted Operating Income, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 2, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The third quarter has started off well as back-to-school shopping is underway and we expect grocery market share gains to continue.

I\\'m joined by a few members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart\\'s President and CEO; Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart US.

We\\'re pleased with our sales momentum and adjusted EPS growth of 43% versus last year. We had strong performance in all three segments. As the pandemic continues, it\\'s impacting the countries where we operate in different ways. So our teams are adapting to overcome the challenges and deliver the strong results we\\'re sharing today. We continue to be grateful to all of our associates for their dedication to serving others., [Quarter Results, Sales Momentum, Adjusted EPS Growth, Segment Performance, Pandemic Impact, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, 2021 brings its own unique challenges and uncertainty, but overall my optimism is higher than it was at the beginning of the year for several reasons. In the US, economic stimulus is clearly having an impact, but we also see encouraging signs that our customers want to get out and shop. Our execution is improving despite the hurdles presented by the pandemic. The second half will likely have more uncertainty than a normal year, but we like our position. Our stores are getting stronger and our e-commerce capabilities are expanding as we continue to grow. Customers will decide how and when they want to shop and they\\'ll find us ready whether they want to shop in store, pick up an order or have it delivered., Optimism,\\nEconomic Stimulus, Pandemic, Execution, Position, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Key elements of our strategy are coming together nicely. We saw an acceleration of traffic in our stores, gained market share in grocery, improved in-stock levels and grew e-commerce sales globally by 43% in constant currency, excluding recent divestitures. Global e-commerce penetration now represents over 12% of total Company sales, an increase of 340 basis points over last year., Strategy,\\nTraffic, Market Share, In-Stock Levels, E-commerce Sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Looking ahead, we\\'ll navigate the supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures, whether that\\'s in cost of goods or wages. We\\'ll monitor our price gaps and adjust as appropriate with both customers and shareholders in mind. As it relates to COVID-19, the past several weeks have been more challenging in some countries. India, Canada, Chile and South Africa are priorities at the moment. Supporting our associates is our primary focus, but we\\'re also investing our resources to support the countries as we find opportunities to do so., Supply Chain,\\nInflation, Price Gaps, COVID-19, Associates Support, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In India, we\\'re donating oxygen concentrators, PPE and financial support. When it comes to helping people get vaccinated, we\\'re engaged in multiple countries. In the US, we\\'ve administered millions of doses. We\\'re taking steps to encourage our associates and everyone to become vaccinated. Given CDC guidance, our US associates that have been vaccinated can now work without a mask if they choose to, and we\\'ve added a cash incentive as one more step to encourage vaccinations. All of our Walmart and Sam\\'s Club pharmacies in the US are administering vaccines, and we can provide them without an appointment. We\\'ve also collaborated with national and local organizations to support more than 200 community events across the country so far. In India, we\\'re facilitating vaccinations for our associates and their households and our Flipkart and PhonePe contractors, more 200,000 people. Across the countries where we operate, we\\'ll keep looking for more places to make a difference. This pandemic won\\'t be over until it\\'s over for everyone., India,\\nVaccination, Associates Support, Financial Support, CDC Guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In addition to combating the pandemic, we also announced a new commitment to US manufacturing during the quarter. Over the next 10 years, we\\'ve set a goal to purchase an additional $350 billion on items made grown or assembled in the US. We estimate this commitment will create more than 750,000 new American jobs and avoid 100 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. We also want to make it easier for manufacturing in the US to flourish. That\\'s why we\\'re launching an initiative called American Light Houses. We\\'ll bring together partners from the supplier community, academia and government, among other groups, to identify and overcome top-down barriers to US production., Pandemic,\\nManufacturing Commitment, Job Creation, CO2 Emissions, American Light Houses, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also have other exciting news to share as we continue to invest in the technologies of tomorrow. In collaboration with NGE North America, a power generator and services company, we\\'re adding more than 500 MW to the US renewable grid through three separate wind projects. Together, these projects are expected to supply renewable energy to hundreds of stores, clubs and distribution facilities annually. That\\'s enough renewable energy to power over 240,000 average American homes for a year. That\\'s on top of the 4 gigawatts of renewable energy currently supplied by our projects globally. This is one more example of the important work we\\'re doing to become a regenerative company., Renewable\\nEnergy, Wind Projects, Power Generation, Regenerative Company, Investment, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now let\\'s talk more about our results for the quarter. Walmart US had another strong quarter. The team delivered for our customers as they shopped in our stores and online and additional government stimulus payments created a tailwind. Our comp sales of 6%, including 37% growth in e-commerce, were strong. Strength was broad based across categories, including apparel, home, hardlines and seasonal. I recently visited stores, clubs and supply chain facilities in New Jersey, Delaware, DC, Ohio, New Mexico, Texas, Illinois, California and Florida. I continue to be grateful for the job our associates are doing, and I\\'m impressed by their spirit. They\\'re operating safely in a pandemic, improving our in-stock and standards, working hard to fulfill pickup and delivery orders and vaccinating millions. Doing all those things at once isn\\'t easy, and we\\'ve had our challenges, but our associates continue to step up and they\\'re strengthening our position as they do it., Strong quarterly results, Walmart US, Customer shopping experience, Associate\\nperformance, Pandemic challenges, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the US, our first-party retail business is strong, but we\\'re also making good progress in other important parts of our business. Marketplace GMV, fulfillment services and advertising income with Walmart Connect are all strong. The flywheel we showed you in February is being built. Each component is positioning us to serve the customer better while diversifying the model. As we previously shared, the top of the flywheel starts with being the best first place people shop. Store remodels, investments in pickup and delivery capacity and sales of Walmart+ fall into this category of activities. We need more capacity to get ahead of demand, and we remain convinced these investments are smart ones. This is one of the keys to selling more Walmart+ memberships, which is an important piece of our strategy over time., Strong US retail\\nbusiness, Marketplace GMV growth, Flywheel initiatives, Store remodels and capacity expansion,\\nWalmart+ membership sales, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In addition to work at the top of the flywheel, we\\'ll continuously add brands, assortment and capabilities to our e-commerce general merchandise business with first-party inventory and marketplace expansion. We\\'ll invest in our general merchandise business and grow in higher-margin categories. The announced acquisition of Zeekit is a great example. This start-up combines fashion and technology through a dynamic virtual fitting room and underscores the desire to grow our apparel business aggressively. We continue our work to build a larger health and wellness business and help customers and associates have a better experience when it comes to their healthcare. Our acquisition of MeMD is a big step in that direction. Adding a telehealth capability was important., Flywheel initiatives, E-commerce expansion, First-party inventory, Marketplace growth, Health and\\nwellness business, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Just as we\\'re doing with core retail, we\\'re building an omnichannel health and wellness business. At Sam\\'s Club, the momentum continues. Our items are improving, membership and sales comps are strong and the team keeps adding and scaling capabilities like curbside. We\\'re seeing strength in categories associated with social gatherings as well as an increase in business member activity. Categories like restaurant supplies are coming back. We saw a tremendous growth in membership income for the quarter, and overall, membership counts are at an all-time high. Like our source business, government stimulus helped our results, but I\\'m confident the underlying business is strong and moving in the right direction for our members., Omnichannel health and\\nwellness, Sam\\'s Club momentum, Curbside capabilities, Membership income growth, Government stimulus, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our international team has been busy transitioning the portfolio to higher growth markets, and it\\'s working. As you\\'ll recall, we recently divested our businesses in the UK, Japan and Argentina. And as a result, net sales for the quarter declined about 11% year-on-year. On a like-for-like basis, when we remove the recently divested markets, net sales increased 5.1%. These are good results and demonstrate the segment\\'s ability to deliver growth for the enterprise., International portfolio\\ntransition, Net sales growth, Divestment impact, Like-for-like sales increase, Segment performance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In India, for the first quarter, Flipkart and PhonePe continued to experience strong growth as annualized total payment value run rate at PhonePe grew by more than 150% versus last year. At Flipkart, monthly active customers and users are key metrics, and we\\'re performing well. Our recent announcement of our intent to acquire Cleartrip, a leading online travel company, underscores our commitment to transform the customer experience through digital commerce. A growing base of customers means we need to continue to add new capabilities, including areas such as logistics and data storage. The recently announced partnership with Adani Group will help us do just that., Flipkart growth,\\nPhonePe growth, Announced acquisition of Cleartrip, Monthly active customers, Logistics and data\\nstorage capabilities, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, WALMEX continues to be strong and the flywheel is coming to life. Our assets in this market uniquely position us to serve customers in new ways, and they\\'re responding. In Mexico, sales and e-commerce increased 166%, and our same-day delivery service is now available from 680 locations. Similar to the US, we\\'re expanding our business to include more than just traditional retail. A few areas of note include the advertising business, which saw an increase of more than 100% in new advertisers, and our new mobile phone services network that provides voice, data and home broadband, bringing access and value to our customers. We doubled the number of users of these services during the quarter as customers enjoy the convenience of adding data to their plan right at the checkout., Strong WALMEX\\nperformance, Flywheel initiatives, Same-day delivery service expansion, Advertising business growth,\\nMobile phone services network growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In China, our e-commerce business in Sam\\'s Club continue to resonate with customers and members. Helped by a strong Chinese New Year, the Club business delivered strong sales across all categories, leading to double-digit comp sales growth. We grew overall e-commerce sales 60% on top of the impressive growth last year. Results from our business in Canada were good even as lockdown measures intensified as the quarter progressed. We started with strong sales in stores and e-commerce, but COVID-19 related restrictions on sales of certain merchandise categories toward the end of the quarter pressured our performance. The underlying business is strong, and we\\'re confident in our omnichannel model for this market., Chinese New Year sales\\ngrowth, Double-digit comp sales growth, E-commerce sales growth, Canadian business performance,\\nOmnichannel model strength, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'ll close today by thanking everyone for a strong quarter. It all starts with our associates and their focus on serving our customers and members. We\\'re being aggressive and dialing up innovation and speed. We\\'re moving fast to learn new skills and to sharpen our edge on existing ones. And we\\'ll move even faster as we invest in key areas to accelerate growth into the future. Thank you for your interest in our Company., Strong quarter,\\nAssociates and customer service, Innovation and speed, Key area investments, Future growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re pleased with strong first quarter results and the continued momentum in the business, with both strong sales and profit growth. While stimulus spending benefited results, it\\'s exciting to see the continued progress in our underlying business as we execute on the fundamentals and progress with our omni strategy. Newer businesses within our ecosystem like advertising and fulfillment services are growing rapidly, helping margins and allowing us to continue to invest in other strategic priorities. Our unique assets, value proposition and financial strength put us in a great competitive position to win, keeping the customer at the center of all we do. As we expected, we\\'re growing grocery market share again in the US compared to last year, according to Nielsen. Value and assortment will continue to resonate with customers as does the convenience we provide with our omni shopping options., Strong sales growth,\\nProfit growth, Omni strategy, Advertising and fulfillment services growth, Grocery market share\\ngrowth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s discuss Q1 results. As we\\'ve mentioned previously, the divestitures in the UK, Japan and Argentina significantly affect year-over-year comparisons. We outlined the anticipated effect of divestitures on key financial metrics when we provided guidance in February. So my comments today will focus on the underlying business, excluding the effect of divestitures., Underlying business\\nperformance, Key financial metrics, Divestitures impact, Guidance provided in February, Year-over-\\nyear comparisons, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Total constant currency revenue growth was strong, up 5.8% to more than $132 billion, with underlying business trends continuing to improve while stimulus spending benefited US sales even versus last year\\'s consumer stock-up phase and initial stimulus. Walmart US comp sales were stronger than expected, up 6% in the quarter and up 16% on a two year stack. Sam\\'s Club grew comp sales nearly 11%, excluding fuel and tobacco, and international sales growth was strong, increasing more than 5% in constant currency, with strength in India, Canada and China. Globally, e-commerce sales growth remains robust at more than 40%., Strong revenue growth,\\nUnderlying business trends improvement, US comp sales growth, Sam\\'s Club comp sales growth,\\nInternational sales growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gross profit margin increased 96 basis points, led by Walmart US, reflecting mix shifts due in part to stimulus spending, lower markdowns and lapping last year\\'s COVID related stock-up, which was more focused on food and consumables. As expected, SG&A expenses were pressured by increased wage and technology investments in the US, partially offset by lower COVID-related costs, resulting in 21 basis points of deleverage. Overall, though, I feel good about expense focus across the Company., Gross profit margin\\ngrowth, Mix shifts, Stimulus spending impact, SG&A expenses deleverage, Expense focus across the\\ncompany, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Operating income on a constant currency basis was up over 28%, and adjusted EPS of $1.69 was 43% higher than last year\\'s Q1 adjusted EPS. The divested businesses contributed $0.07 of EPS due to partial period ownership in the quarter. GAAP EPS was $0.97, which includes net losses on our equity investments as well as the incremental loss in international divestitures. Operating cash flow declined about $4 billion due primarily to inventory increases versus last year when in-stock levels were much lower due to stock-up shopping. We stepped up buybacks during the quarter with $2.8 billion of share repurchase. We continue to feel great about the value of the Company., Operating income growth,\\nAdjusted EPS growth, Divested businesses contribution, GAAP EPS, Inventory increases, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s discuss the quarterly results for each segment., Quarterly results,\\nSegment performance, Revenue growth, Operating income growth, Share repurchase, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walmart US had another strong quarter, aided by stimulus spending and underlying improvements in the grocery business as well as strength in reopening categories such as travel, celebration and personal care. We\\'re particularly encouraged by the improving trends in store transactions which turned solidly positive in April for the first time in a year. We also saw strong market share gains in grocery, according to Nielsen, and continued strength in e-commerce. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 6%, resulting in a strong two-year stack comp of 16%. Sales strength was broad based across channels, with e-commerce sales growth of 37%., Walmart US performance,\\nStimulus spending impact, Grocery business improvement, Store transactions trends, E-commerce sales\\ngrowth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The omni strategy continues to resonate as customers utilize all the shopping options we offer and we continue to expand pickup and delivery capacity from stores. Customer trip consolidation led to nearly 10% increase in average basket size, with 3% fewer transactions. Strong sales trends were led by apparel, home and lawn and garden. Grocery sales declined against uniquely tough comparison, but comps were up low-double digits on a two-year stack basis, including mid-teens growth in food categories, helped by strong price positioning, improving in-stocks and expanded store hours relative to last year. We\\'re pleased with the progress of strategic growth initiatives such as Walmart Connect advertising, e-commerce marketplace and Walmart fulfillment services. Advertising revenue was robust with triple-digit growth for the quarter., Omni strategy, Customer trip\\nconsolidation, Average basket size, Grocery sales, Strategic growth initiatives, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gross profit rate was strong at more than 140 basis points, reflecting favorable mix shift to higher margin general merchandise categories and lower markdowns. Margins were also helped by lapping last year\\'s COVID related closures of vision centers and auto care centers. SG&A expenses deleveraged 49 basis points as increased associate wage investments and increased technology spend were partially offset by an approximate $400 million reduction in COVID related costs versus last year. Operating income was very strong, up nearly 27%., Gross profit rate, Mix shift, SG&A\\nexpenses deleverage, Operating income growth, COVID related costs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Inventory increased 16%, reflecting strong sales growth and lapping last year\\'s COVID-related effects on inventory. We continue to monitor industry challenges related to transit and port delays, and our merchants have taken steps to mitigate the challenges, including adding extra lead time to orders. The fundamentals of the US business continue to improve, and we\\'re confident we have the strategy, structure and people in place to serve customers and reach our goals this year and beyond., Inventory growth, COVID-related\\neffects, Transit and port delays, Merchant steps, Strategy and structure, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, International delivered strong Q1 results with net sales growth of 5.1% in constant currency, including strength in India, Canada and China, despite many markets being negatively affected toward the end of the quarter by a resurgence of COVID. The benefit of strategic portfolio realignment to focus on higher growth markets is becoming more evident in top line growth. E-commerce sales increased approximately 64% and penetration grew more than 570 basis points to about 16% of sales. Currency benefited sales by approximately $0.7 billion., Strong Q1 results, Net sales growth,\\nInternational markets, Strategic portfolio realignment, E-commerce sales growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Comp sales in Mexico declined slightly against a tough comparison but were up low-double digits on a two-year stack basis as the omnichannel strategy continues to accelerate. The Mexico business has made good progress expanding alternative revenue and profit streams within the ecosystem, including doubling the number of digital advertisers and continue to see strong growth in mobile services. Canada comps increased 3.4%, with more than 115% growth in e-commerce sales despite headwinds later in the quarter from COVID-related government restrictions on the sales of non-essential categories like apparel and general merchandise. China comps increased 1.3% and were up 13% on a two year stack. Strong Chinese New Year sales, continued strength of Sam\\'s Clubs and e-commerce growth of 60%, all contributed to the result. Flipkart continues to perform well, driving strong and sustainable e-commerce GMV growth and strong trends in monthly active customers and users even as the teams deal with the challenges of resurging COVID cases in India., Omnichannel strategy, Alternative\\nrevenue streams, E-commerce growth, Government restrictions, Flipkart performance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, International operating income was strong, up more than 21% as better sales mix and fewer markdowns in certain markets benefited margins in addition to continued focus on expenses., Strong operating income growth, Better\\nsales mix, Fewer markdowns, Focus on expenses, International markets, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The momentum at Sam\\'s Club continued in the first quarter, with comp sales growth of 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco, due in part to stimulus spending. On a two-year stack basis, comps were up nearly 27%. Comps benefited from both increased ticket and transactions. Strength was broad based across categories, with home and apparel leading the way. E-commerce sales were strong, increasing 47%, led by strength in curbside pickup at the Club. We are pleased with the continued strong membership trends as membership income grew about 13%. We achieved a new high for overall membership counts during the quarter and saw higher renewal rates, including strong first-year renewals and rising + penetration. Operating income increased more than 16% in Q1, but including the negative impact of fuel, profit increased 33%., Sam\\'s Club momentum, Comp sales\\ngrowth, E-commerce sales growth, Membership trends, Operating income growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our typical practice is to not update guidance until the second quarter release. But we\\'re in an unusual period where Q1 stimulus led to meaningful sales and profit tailwinds that weren\\'t contemplated when we provided guidance in February. The guidance discussed here assumes that COVID conditions continue to improve and there won\\'t be significant additional government stimulus packages for the remainder of the year. We now anticipate higher full year enterprise sales growth than originally projected, primarily due to the strong Q1 performance and our initial forecast for Q2. Excluding the impact of divestitures, consolidated net sales growth is now expected to be up low to mid-single digits versus our original guidance of low single-digit increase. We\\'re also raising full year guidance for operating income and EPS to reflect the strong performance in Q1 and our expectation for a potentially better second quarter than previously expected., Q1 sales and profit tailwinds,\\nGuidance update, COVID conditions, Government stimulus packages, Full year guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, On a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of divestitures, we now expect full year consolidated operating income to increase by high-single digits for the year and EPS to increase by low-double digits, which is an increase from our prior guidance of both being flat to up slightly. Walmart US operating income is now expected to increase high single digits versus our original guidance of a slight increase. The second quarter has started off a bit better than originally anticipated as stimulus spending continues to benefit certain general merchandise categories, and we expect grocery market share gains to continue. We now anticipate Q2 EPS, excluding divestitures, will be up low-single digits and assumes a low single digit Walmart US comp sales increase, excluding fuel., Full year guidance, Operating income\\ngrowth, EPS growth, Walmart US performance, Q2 expectations, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The COVID pandemic continues to create both tailwinds and headwinds for our business. While Q1 was aided by stimulus spending primarily in the US, certain international markets continue to be negatively affected by the resurgence in COVID cases and related government restrictions on operations, particularly in India and Canada. Given continued uncertainty, we\\'re maintaining our original guidance for the back half of the year, and we\\'ll update you as we gain clarity on key external variables related to the health crisis and their potential impact on our business and the global economy., COVID pandemic, Stimulus spending,\\nInternational markets, Government restrictions, Guidance update, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Again, I\\'m very pleased with the first quarter results and feel good about the underlying strength of the business., Pleasant first quarter results,\\nStrength of the business, Underlying strength, Walmart\\nWMT, 2022, 1, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you for your time and interest this morning. And we\\'d be happy to take your questions., Thank you, Time, Interest, Questions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us for our 2021 investment community meeting. We\\'re grateful for your interest in our company and for the confidence so many of you have in our future. We believe that confidence is well founded, and we\\'re excited to give you an update on the opportunities we see ahead. I\\'ve been a part of Walmart for more than 30 years now, and I can\\'t remember a time when there were so much exciting change happening inside our company., Investment community meeting, Company\\nupdate, Confidence in future, Exciting changes, Walmart, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, The world around us is changing in big and important ways, and I\\'m so encouraged by how our associates are leading and embracing change. We have a blend of experience and new thinking that are coming together to allow us to execute with more creativity and speed. We aren\\'t the business we were just a few years ago. And we aren\\'t the business you will see in the years ahead. We\\'re moving., Leading change, Embracing change,\\nExecuting with creativity, Moving forward, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Glass was a CEO that followed Sam Walton. He led us into the food business and got us started outside the United States. In the 1990s I remember him telling us repeatedly that the company was just getting started. Every time I\\'d hear him say it, I would think, really? We were already large by then and so much has already happened. But today I can tell our associates the same thing. There is so much opportunity still in front of us. We have the talent, the culture and the assets to thrive in the next generation of retail, to invent it. We\\'ve been building for this moment and the moment is here. It\\'s up to us., David Glass, Sam Walton, Food\\nbusiness, International expansion, Retail industry, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We can make it true that in 2021 this company was just getting started. I know many of you have been investing in and following Walmart for a long time, and you know a lot about our company. This is a different business today and we\\'re just getting started. We\\'re moving. Looking back at 2020, I\\'m so proud of how our a big team has responded to the challenges. They just keep stepping up. It feels like our customers and society have come to appreciate our associates more than usual, and that\\'s well deserved. So many have been selfless and courageous., Getting started, Moving forward, Team\\nresponse, Customer appreciation, Societal appreciation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve tried to show our frontline associates in our stores, clubs and supply chain our respect and gratitude with our words and our actions. They along with our customers, our shareholders, our suppliers and partners, the communities we serve and the planet we seek to strengthen, shape our decisions. We take a multi-stakeholder view because we know that mindset and approach deliver the most valuable sustainable business over time., Frontline associates, Respect and\\ngratitude, Multi-stakeholder view, Sustainable business, Valuable sustainability, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, As for today, Brett will join us in a moment to talk about our results for the fourth quarter as well as to provide an outlook on our expectations for the next few years. I\\'ll come back after his remarks to talk through the acceleration of our strategy and how we\\'ll deliver sustainable long-term growth. Then you\\'ll hear from several of our leaders about the specifics of our plan., Brett, Q4 results, Outlook, Strategy\\nacceleration, Leadership, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'m confident you\\'ll leave this session with a clear understanding of a few key points. First, innovation and speed. It\\'s time for us to dial-up our aggressiveness even more and go faster. Walmart is in a position of strength and we have momentum. Our confidence in our plan motivates us to accelerate, and we\\'ll walk you through why we feel that way., Innovation, Speed, Momentum,\\nAggressiveness, Confidence, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Second, we\\'re building a new customer-centric business model. Our customers welcome us serving them in new ways. And our assets and capabilities are being monetized in ways we haven\\'t tapped into before. We have assets to leverage like our stores and supply chain, strengths like our store traffic and a brand trusted for value. We have foundational cornerstones like EDLP and EDLC. We can stay true to who we are and build on our strengths, while buildin a mutually reinforcing flywheel. We\\'re starting to drive the top and bottom line in more expensive ways. Our bottom line is becoming more diversified, which will enable us more operating income growth over time. We\\'re repositioning to be in different businesses and exiting some geographies so resources are shifted to our priorities. We\\'re building a better model, and it\\'s uniquely Walmart., Customer-centric business model, Asset\\nmonetization, EDLP, EDLC, Operating income growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Third, we\\'ll continue designing this business to create shared value for all our stakeholders. We\\'re out to demonstrate that our company can do even more good for people as we grow. Communities are strengthened. Customers, associates, shareholders and suppliers benefit. Everyone wins. I\\'ll be back to share more specifics on the strategy in a few minutes., Shared value, Stakeholders, Growth,\\nCommunities, Strategy, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now I\\'d like to welcome Brett to add his view on the quarter and the future. Brett?, Brett, View, Quarter, Future, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, Brett. Thank you for your leadership and partnership. We\\'re pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the year. Growth was strong across the company. Innovation and speed picked up. We moved quickly to add new capabilities to protect the health of our associates, serve customers and members safely in our stores and clubs and serve them with more capacity for pickup and delivery. We found ways to support the explosive growth in eCommerce and learned how to hire people in hours rather than days, which enabled hundreds of thousands of people to get work when they really needed it and when we really needed them., Growth, Innovation, Speed, Associates,\\neCommerce, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We managed our business well in an unpredictable environment, but we certainly didn\\'t get everything right. Given supply constraints, our in-stock suffered significantly during portions of the year, store standards were impacted. We would reduce store hours and limit customer density all over again, but that did impact our sales. Those realities should provide some upside in 2021 as we lap the extraordinarily strong results of last year. I want to thank our associates around the world. They have been courageous. They are adapting to change. They worked really hard to overcome the hurdles presented by one of the most difficult periods in history, and I know they\\'ll continue to do so., Supply constraints, In-stock, Store\\nhours, Customer density, Associates, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, The challenges of the past year came in different forms and weren\\'t limited to the health crisis. We\\'re all aware of the difficult social, political and economic realities that we face. These are deep-rooted problems that we all have to tackle. As for Walmart, we will continue to be part of the solutions. As it relates to the health crisis, we helped with PPE for healthcare workers and stood up COVID testing sites. We donated more than GBP625 million of food and over $55 million in grants for hunger relief in 2020. Now we\\'re supporting the country in the vaccination effort., Health crisis, PPE, COVID testing\\nsites, Food donation, Vaccination effort, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, As it relates to the financial crisis, we\\'ll help with employment and we\\'ll help small businesses by buying their goods, building an expanded marketplace for sellers and as Sam\\'s Club serves family owned restaurants and other small businesses. Small businesses are vital to our economy. When it comes to the social and political challenges we all face, we will engage in public conversations in ways that are thoughtful, constructive and in line with our values. We are committed to racial equity. We\\'ll keep changing inside our company and find ways to leverage our business and influence to shape systems extending beyond our company. This work is important to me and it\\'s important to our associates, including our leadership. And we know it\\'s strategic. Being diverse and inclusive is smart business., Financial crisis, Employment, Small\\nbusinesses, Social challenges, Racial equity, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, 2020 not only confirmed our strategy, it accelerated it by fast-forwarding many of the customer trends we\\'ve been building toward. We feel emboldened, and are now moving with even more speed and aggressiveness. We\\'re scaling new capabilities in businesses and designing them to work together in a mutually reinforcing way. As we imagine the future, we believe people, our customers, families will want an even better value for their money. Our merchandise assortment that is relevant to their life and seems limitless. Services that help them save time save money and get or stay healthy. An experience that is easy and enjoyable. And the knowledge that the company they do business with can be trusted to treat every one in their supply chain well and take actions that strengthen our planet., Customer trends, Strategy, Speed,\\nAggressiveness, Value for money, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the future, people will still want to shop in compelling stores. But more and more, there will be occasions where they prefer to pickup an order or have it delivered. Some customers will eventually allow us and pay us to keep them replenished in their homes on the items they routinely purchase. For an increasing number of customers, Walmart will be seen more like a service. Customers will think of us as the merchant that serve their wants and needs, but in ways that take less time and effort. We won\\'t just be utilitarian for them., Future shopping, Pickup, Delivery,\\nReplenishment, Service, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll serve up items and ideas that are relevant and exciting. We\\'ll reach them directly and through other platforms. Our customer relationships will continue to broaden and deepen in health and wellness and financial services. Our customers view these as natural and expected components of their Walmart experience. We\\'ll have all of these things together in a seamless way., Relevant, Exciting, Direct reach,\\nCustomer relationships, Seamless experience, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, So we\\'re in an early stage of building a new business model that will enable us to serve people how they want to be served in any particular moment and thrive in the next generation of retail as a business. Over time, we believe the big winners in retail will be those that deliver a unique interrelated ecosystem. Many of you will remember the original Walmart productivity loop. We lowered prices, grew sales and leveraged expenses. Some of you will remember the ecosystem chart we shared in 2018. While we continue to learn, our thinking moves on., Unique ecosystem, Interrelated\\nbusiness model, Lower prices, Grow sales, Leveraged expenses, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, And so we\\'d like to share today\\'s version as a way to describe our emerging business model. It should help you better understand how we\\'ll serve customers and drive sustainable diversified operating income growth over time. As I describe it, some of my comments are specific to the U.S., but you should think of this as applying in all of our priority markets around the world. Think about it as a flywheel that\\'s spinning, powered by a mutually reinforcing set of assets., Emerging business model, Customer\\nservice, Sustainable growth, Operating income, Mutually reinforcing assets, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We start with the customer in the center. We\\'re designing for them. Our relationship with them is founded on our ability to provide them the lowest prices on the items they buy all the time. They come to our stores and our app to get the things they want or need. Our first priority is to continue to earn their business when it\\'s time to buy the big basket, the stock up trip, to be the best in first place they shop. We do that well with the Supercenter format. Having a broad assortment so close to 90% of America is an advantage., Customer, Low prices, Relationship,\\nFirst priority, Supercenter format, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we\\'ve added pickup and delivery capabilities, we\\'ve experienced a lot of growth, but too often, we aren\\'t able to meet the demand. This is a good problem to have, but we need to solve it quickly given how trends accelerated as a result of the pandemic. So we\\'re going to invest more aggressively in capacity and automation to position ourselves to earn the primary destination position with customers. We are absolutely playing offense here. Customers can choose to visit a store, pickup their order, have it delivered, have it delivered into a secure box on their front step, into a garage refrigerator or all the way into their kitchen even when they\\'re not at home., Investment, Capacity, Automation, Customer choice, Offense, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, When you hear us say delivery, define that as the combination of delivery from our stores, clubs and eCommerce fulfillment centers. Our customers and members are indifferent as to whether their delivered items come from a store or an FC. So we can optimize for speed and cost behind the scenes as we meet or exceed customer expectations. Over time, more and more of our customers will want Walmart+ because it makes life better. That relationship will drive repeat business and provide data that enables us to serve them even better and be more personalized. It\\'s an important piece of our strategy. For now, we\\'re focused on continuing a high quality experience for Walmart+ members as we add capacity. Over time, we\\'ll add more benefits to the membership to broaden its appeal., Delivery, Customer expectations,\\nWalmart+, Repeat business, Data usage, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Moving to 3 o\\'clock on the wheel. The demand we\\'ve been experiencing in general merchandise is amazing. Beyond the pandemic, our eCommerce business will continue to grow at a fast pace. We expect our eCommerce sales globally to be over $100 billion in the next couple of years. We continue to add assortment in brands. Our emphasis here is on general merchandise. We\\'ve got a lot of upside in apparel, home and hardlines. To capture that upside, we\\'re going to pull forward investments in space and automation. As our fulfillment capacity grows, we\\'ll use it to improve the customer experience, expand our first-party assortment, grow our marketplace and build our fulfillment services business, which is scaling nicely., Demand, eCommerce growth, Assortment,\\nInvestments, Customer experience, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Beyond selling merchandise, we can do more to serve the healthcare needs of families. They want and need high quality preventative, accessible and affordable healthcare. As you evaluate our opportunity in healthcare, consider not only our pharmacy, optical, hearing and OTC businesses, but also consider our position as the country\\'s largest seller of food and how that relates to health. Our locations, which enable access. Our large stores and large parking lots, which give us room to expand. Our experience with the social benefits where we cover a lot of lives. And our growing digital capabilities. Together, they create the opportunity for a differentiated omnichannel healthcare business that helps a lot of people. We aren\\'t starting from scratch. We\\'re convinced our customers want this and they trust us to provide it., Healthcare, Preventative care,\\nAccessible healthcare, Affordable healthcare, Omnichannel healthcare, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Financial services are also a way we can help make daily life better for customers. Last month, we announced the formation of a new fintech start-up designed to develop and offer innovative and affordable financial solutions. Our customers have been clear that they want more from us in terms of financial services, and this new approach will help us deliver for them in a differentiated way more quickly. For a fintech start-up, customer acquisition costs are high, and our platform lower those costs. We have a head-start., Financial services, Innovative\\nsolutions, Affordable financial solutions, Customer acquisition costs, Fintech start-up, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Moving to 6 o\\'clock on the wheel. Our purpose is to save money and help people live better. So we must operate at a lower cost and do it in a way that\\'s sustainable. As you know, we\\'ve had several automation tests going on. I\\'m very pleased to share a few of the most important forms are now ready to scale. These investments will enable us to improve the customer experience and increase productivity. Our digital transformation continues. Our way of working, our use of data and the modernization of our tech stack continue., Saving money, Helping people,\\nAutomation, Customer experience, Digital transformation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Earlier, I mentioned diversifying our profit base. Scaling new profit pools is a priority. Make marketplace and fulfillment services, advertising, financial services, data monetization and last mile delivery. These are all early stage businesses that are scaling or are positioned to scale. The resulting more diversified model will allow us to sustainably reinvest back into the customer value proposition and choose how much flows through into profit., Diversifying profit base, Scaling new\\nprofit pools, Advertising, Financial services, Data monetization, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, As I walked through the flywheel, I mentioned several investments. Based on everything I\\'ve learned over the years and the opportunity I see looking ahead, this is the right time to make these investments. The strategy, team and capabilities are in place. We know where the customer is going. We have momentum and our balance sheet is strong., Investments, Strategy, Team, Customer,\\nMomentum, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Here\\'s what we see. First, the combination of stores and eCommerce is a winner. Last year\\'s step changed our eCommerce business and our stores are an asset. We have demand and need more space earlier than we had planned a year ago. Given that delivery is a key driver of Walmart+, we need more capacity to grow Walmart+ with a high net promoter score., Stores and eCommerce, Demand for\\nspace, Delivery capacity, Walmart+, Net promoter score, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Second, our automation plan is now ready to scale. We\\'ll be investing in our distribution centers, our eCommerce fulfillment centers and in market fulfillment centers, which will, in many cases, be inside of or built beside our stores. John will tell you more about what this means for our U.S. business. Those investments will enable productivity improvements for years to come. They have a nice IRR., Automation plan, Investing, Distribution centers, E-commerce fulfillment centers, Market\\nfulfillment centers, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Big picture, think of our U.S. supply chain with hundreds of distribution and fulfillment centers, thousands of stores and clubs so close to so many people functioning in a hybrid fashion, automated where they should be based on volumes and complemented with onsite market fulfillment centers or offsite MFCs where we see incremental demand. Importantly, imagine our supply chain is interconnected so the cost to meet or exceed customer expectations is optimized. And imagine our growing network with the next-gen level of automation. I think the next few years will represent more change in our supply chain than even the grocery DC rollout we did to support Supercenters. It\\'s really exciting., Supply chain, Distribution centers,\\nFulfillment centers, Automation, Customer expectations, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll keep investing in store remodels so that our stores are fresh and appealing. We\\'ll also continue to invest in our people. Last fall, we changed the structure in our U.S. stores, leaning even more into teams. At that time, we gave a raise to 165,000 people. And now we\\'ll be raising wages for 425,000 more. These are investments in people that are important to our future because they provide a great pickup, delivery and in-store experience for our customers. These investments are part of a strategy we\\'ve pursued since I started in this role. We\\'ve increased our starting wages by more than 50% since 2015., Investing, Store remodels, People,\\nWage raises, Customer experience, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Once these increases are implemented, approximately half of our U.S. hourly associates, about 730,000 people, will earn at least $15 an hour. Our average wage in the U.S. will be at least $15.25 per hour. Our supply chain associates are already earning $15 or more. And we\\'ve made additional wage investments in Sam\\'s Club over the last few years., Wage increases, Associates, Hourly\\nworkers, Supply chain, Average wage, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Importantly, in addition to hourly wage rates, we\\'ll continue investing to provide career opportunities through our internal education programs and access to affordable degrees. Because of technology, the future of work will be different and we want to prepare our associates for that journey. We believe we should do more than provide just an hourly wage. Bonuses for some roles, our 401(k) match, stock ownership plan, affordable healthcare and other components are smart investments. We\\'ll make these investments in our supply chain and people, while also staying on track to modernize our technology. To pay for all that, we\\'ll keep growing sales, expand our general merchandise business and scale mutually reinforcing and profitable businesses. The guidance that Brett provided this morning includes these investments for these areas I\\'ve just described., Investing, Career opportunities,\\nTechnology, Sales growth, Guidance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, One way to think about us is to recognize our people and physical assets as strategic moats and realize that we\\'re changing how we think and work to build digital products and related businesses that complement those assets and have helpful margins; marketplace, advertising and membership income, for example. We aren\\'t strangers to membership. Sam\\'s Club in the U.S., China and Mexico is performing very well, and that performance accelerated during 2020. Sam\\'s is innovating, adding new capabilities and improving our merchandise offer especially in fresh food and with our Member\\'s Mark private brand. Sam\\'s is a big business for us and it has strong momentum., People, Assets, Digital products,\\nMembership, Innovation, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, As I mentioned before, this mutually reinforcing flywheel concept applies in our priority markets outside the U.S. Specific elements of the flywheel such as pickup and delivery, eCommerce and marketplace, fulfillment services, payment and other financial services and advertising have application in Mexico, Canada, India and China. The same flywheel assets are adapted to be relevant to the specific needs of the customer in each market and to leverage our different operating models., Flywheel concept, Priority markets,\\nPickup and delivery, eCommerce, Fulfillment services, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let me focus on Mexico and India for a minute. We see an opportunity to grow eCommerce market share in Mexico. Our stores business is strong, and an omnichannel approach will be a winner in this market. Our Walmex team has done a great job of growing eCommerce, including a strong same-day delivery option from stores and clubs. The pandemic had a similar impact to customer trends in Mexico as it did in the U.S. So now the next step for us is to leverage the momentum we have to grow 1P and 3P eCommerce through investments in technology, supply chain and customer acquisition. The team is building alternative income streams to complement our traditional retail business, including advertising., eCommerce, Mexico, Omnichannel,\\nTechnology, Advertising, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In India, our momentum and potential for growth make this a unique opportunity. eCommerce penetration is still low, but growing rapidly. We\\'re well positioned to grow as an emerging middle class spends more money through their mobile phones. Like the U.S. and Mexico, this is a market where we\\'ll step on the gas to ensure we have the appropriate level of investment in areas like supply chain. The PhonePe business continues to grow and perform very well. These are homegrown businesses with innovation and problem solving for the Indian customer at their core. We continue to be impressed with Flipkart and PhonePe talent led by Kalyan and Sameer. You\\'ll hear from them along with Judith in a little while., eCommerce, India, Supply chain, Mobile\\ngrowth, Talent, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'ve talked a lot about investing for growth, and I also think it\\'s important for us to call out the areas where we\\'re narrowing our focus and making choices. We\\'re deploying capital to areas where we see the best opportunity for growth, while pulling back in other areas. Over the last few years, you\\'ve seen us divest restaurants and apparel specialty chain, banks, voodoo and eCommerce businesses and brands along with markets like Brazil and Argentina. We\\'ve announced new ownership structures in the U.K. and Japan, moving us to a minority position. We\\'ve executed these decisions to narrow our focus, while also developing important partnerships to drive growth like those with JD.com, Tata, Aditya Birla fashion retailer and Ninjacart. We\\'re being deliberate about where we invest, where we divest and where we partner. We\\'re a good partner and we\\'re flexible., Investing, Focus, Growth, Divestment,\\nPartnerships, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In order for us to pull all of these work streams together into a cohesive well executed strategy, the organization has to think and work in new ways. Think about it as an enabler of our strategy. Whether it\\'s moving to an agile way of working, prioritizing digital acumen and diversity in our talent base or developing new ownership structures around the world, we will function in a way that supports innovation, speed and productivity. Our product teams and technologists are working hand-in-hand with business leaders every day to develop and deploy the right products at the right time for our customers and associates. The tech team we\\'ve assembled is working to take our technology to the next level., Innovation, Agile way of working,\\nTalent, Digital acumen, Ownership structures, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll do the things I\\'ve described, while staying true to our purpose and our core values and while taking a shared value approach. The best way to create a valuable company is to build for the long-term, manage the short-term and serve all the relevant stakeholders. So we\\'re systems thinkers. We connect dots. We design sustainability into our holistic supply chain and save money doing it by eliminating waste. Environmental, social and governance issues aren\\'t side projects. They are strategic, core and part of our culture as aspirations push us beyond sustainability. This is a holistic approach that supports and replenishes humanity and nature. Regeneration means renewing and replenishing in addition to preserving and doing less harm., Systems thinking, Long-term approach,\\nStakeholders, Sustainability, Holistic supply chain, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our target of zero emissions by 2040 with no offsets is an ambitious and motivating challenge. We believe it\\'s important to push toward zero in our own operations even where it\\'s difficult and may not be feasible with current technology. Our push will help drive necessary innovation. We\\'ll lead where we can and help make possible what\\'s not currently possible. Climate change remains at the forefront of our ambitions on regeneration. And you\\'ve heard us talk many times about project Gigaton and our efforts to reduce emissions in the supply chain of our business and those of our suppliers. To date, suppliers have reported a cumulative 375 million metric tons of avoided emissions. We\\'re well on our way to our goal of avoiding 1 billion metric tons of emissions., Climate change, Regeneration, Supply\\nchain, Innovation, Zero emissions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, In summary, we are confident in our strategy. Now is the time for us to be aggressive. Speed matters. We\\'re going to keep the customer in the center and design for them. The new business model we\\'re building will allow us to thrive to reinvent. There is so much opportunity in front of us. Our associates, including our leadership, are the reason we have so much confidence. Sam Walton was described as a merchant with a servant\\'s heart. Our associates are continuing that legacy., Strategy, Customer-centric, Speed, New\\nbusiness model, Associates, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Doug McMillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thank you for your attention. In a moment, we\\'ll begin the first of two Q&A sessions. Brett and I will take your questions about what we\\'ve shared so far, and then you will hear more from the team., Q&A, First session, Second session,\\nTeam, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Good morning, and thanks, Doug. I\\'ve been with Walmart for more than two decades. And this is one of the most challenging and unique times we\\'ve all faced. However, it\\'s also a time that presents great opportunities, and I\\'m looking forward to highlighting some of those for you this morning. I\\'m so proud of how our associates have responded in serving customers, while accelerating our strategy. The recent progress in transforming Walmart into a truly omnichannel business prepared us for this period and it helped shape our future. This is an important moment for Walmart, and we are ready., Challenges, Opportunities, Associates,\\nStrategy, Omnichannel, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, There are several things I want you to take away from this morning. First, we have great momentum. We just completed a year with record sales of $560 billion in constant currency, including record fourth quarter sales of more than $150 billion and record operating cash flow of $36 billion. Profit growth was also strong, thanks to a number of things. Strong sales, in particular, improving general merchandise sales, improving eCommerce margins and improved margin mix overall., Momentum, Sales, Record, Operating\\ncash flow, Profit growth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now certainly we had tailwinds during the year, but we\\'re performing extraordinarily well. This strong performance has allowed us to invest in the future of the business, invest in our associates and give good returns to shareholders. From a position of great strength, we\\'re now going to accelerate investments in supply chain, technology, automation and our associates, allowing us to stay ahead of shifts in customer behavior. We strongly believe these investments will accelerate the company\\'s top-line and profit growth in the mid to long-term. Active portfolio management is also strengthening the model and focusing resources. And we remain laser focused on operating efficiency and delivering sustainable expense leverage., Strong performance, Investments,\\nCustomer behavior, Supply chain, Technology, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, So let\\'s turn to highlights of the fourth quarter and the year. During the year, we saw elevated sales levels related to customer stocking up, eating at home, entertaining and educating at home and investing in home decor and their yards. And of course, those things were supported by stimulus spending. In parallel, we had incremental COVID costs, some of which will continue. We had a strong holiday season, followed by an acceleration in January. Total constant currency revenue was strong, increasing more than $10 billion for the quarter and $40 billion for the year., Sales, Customer behavior, Stimulus\\nspending, COVID costs, Holiday season, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walmart U.S. comp sales excluding fuel grew 8.6% in both Q4 and for the year, including 79% annual growth in eCommerce. Walmart U.S. grew net sales by $29 billion for the year. Now for context, that is similar to the annual revenue of Dollar General and Starbucks. Sam\\'s Club wrapped up a terrific year with full year comp sales growth of 15.8% excluding fuel and tobacco and membership income increased more than 9%. On its own, Sam\\'s Club would rank near the top 50 in the Fortune 500., Walmart U.S., Comp sales excluding\\nfuel, eCommerce, Net sales, Sam\\'s Club, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Outside the U.S., sales increased 6.3% in constant currency for the quarter, including 60% eCommerce growth with strength in India, Mexico and Canada. Seven of nine markets posted positive comp sales. And for the year, International net sales grew more than $6 billion in constant currency. Adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis declined about 3% in the quarter. It was pressured by more than $1 billion of incremental COVID expenses, including associate bonuses as well as a charge of around $220 million related to a decision to repay U.K. property tax relief granted earlier in the year., eCommerce growth, International sales,\\nAdjusted operating income, COVID expenses, Property tax relief, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The fourth quarter also included some increased tech expenses and increased wage pressure related to recently announced structure changes in Walmart U.S. as well as additional headcount to ensure our holiday season was a success, which it was. Excluding the U.K. charge, total company adjusted operating income would have increased. Despite various headwinds, Walmart U.S. adjusted operating income increased 6.5% on solid gross margin improvement and continued reduction in eCommerce losses as well as some benefit related to timing of allocations., Tech expenses, Wage pressure,\\nStructure changes, Adjusted operating income, Gross margin improvement, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For the year, adjusted operating income increased over 9% in constant currency with each segment growing significantly despite more than $4 billion of incremental COVID cost. Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.39, but would have been about $0.37 higher if not for COVID cost and the U.K. property tax repayment. GAAP EPS was a $0.74 loss, significantly impacted by the loss on businesses in the U.K. and Japan, as both are classified as assets held for sale. That\\'s partially offset by an unrealized gain in our investment in JD.com, the value of which has increased by $9 billion since our initial investment. Operating cash flow for the year was exceptionally strong at $36 billion and the company returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. So in summary, it was a great year financially. And on an underlying basis, it was a strong finish., Adjusted operating income, COVID cost,\\nGAAP EPS, Operating cash flow, Investment in JD.com, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Let\\'s now talk about how we plan to continue the strong momentum. Because of our financial strength, competitive position and ability to execute, we\\'re in a unique position to continue innovating and serving customers in multiple ways. Over the past several years, we\\'ve made great progress building an ecosystem of synergistic assets. And we\\'ve made strategic choices, like reducing exposure to lower growth international markets, while focusing on higher growth opportunities in the U.S., Mexico and India., Financial strength, Competitive\\nposition, Innovation, Asset ecosystem, Strategic choices, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now is the time to play even more aggressive offense. We\\'re winning and we intend to keep pushing the ball aggressively down the field. Over the next few years, we\\'re going to step up capital investment, primarily in the U.S., to improve the customer experience, support growth and drive efficiencies. I\\'ll give you some highlights, and you\\'ll hear more as the morning progresses., Aggressive offense, Capital\\ninvestment, Customer experience, Growth, Efficiencies, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As I mentioned earlier, our revenue grew $40 billion last year, putting us at least a year ahead of where we thought we might be. So we need to lean in more aggressively in key markets with increased capital and fulfillment capacity, supply chain, automation and technology. This new infrastructure will allow us to expand eCommerce assortment, enabling us to reduce both shipping time and costs. We\\'ll step up automation in DCs to deliver aisle and department-ready pallets, stores. We\\'ll continue to refresh our existing stores by enhancing pickup and delivery capacity, merchandising programs and efficiency initiatives., Lean infrastructure, eCommerce\\nassortment, Automation, Technology, Store refresh, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In India, we see significant growth opportunities for Flipkart and PhonePe. It\\'s exciting to see the emerging middle class rapidly adopting eCommerce and using their mobile phones to use money transfer, insurance and other services. Meanwhile, we\\'ll step up technology investments to continue upgrading legacy enterprise systems and customer-facing technology. We\\'re on a multi-year journey of modernizing our tech stack and capabilities to increase the efficient use of the cloud and simplify customer and associate experiences., eCommerce, Technology investments,\\nEmerging middle class, Legacy enterprise systems, Multi-year journey, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As we accelerate investment, capex is expected to be around $14 billion this year with most of the increase versus last year in the U.S. Over the next few years, we expect capex to be around 2.5% to 3% of sales. While this is higher than the past few years, it is far below the capex peak of 4% to 5% of sales during the period of heavy Supercenter growth. This spend will allow us to fully optimize our strategy, and in turn, accelerate the company\\'s top-line and profit growth rates in the mid to long-term., Investment, Capex, Sales, Strategy,\\nGrowth, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, After years of transition, these investments should put us in position for 4% plus sales growth and operating income growth rates higher than sales. 4% top-line growth would basically be the equivalent of adding a Fortune 100 company every year. Our unique financial strength allows us to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders while growing the business. And as you saw this morning, we increased our dividend for the 48th consecutive year. And we authorized a new $20 billion share repurchase program, which we plan to execute over the next three years or so. There are so many initiatives under way that give us confidence that these are the right investments at the right time. We\\'re already seeing proof points, and you\\'ll hear more about these later on., Financial strength, Investments, Sales\\ngrowth, Operating income growth, Dividend increase, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect continued strong growth in the U.S. businesses and expect even higher international growth rates as we focus on key markets and making money in new ways. We\\'ll continue improving margin mix through an enhanced general merchandise offering, new brands and marketplace growth with a greater push toward expanding fulfillment and other services for sellers. We\\'ll drive existing and new customer growth through initiatives like Walmart+. We\\'ll grow sales and profit increasingly with growing higher margin businesses and advertising, financial services, marketplace, healthcare services and the like. Our operating discipline will continue to sharpen. After a pause in FY \\'22, primarily because of additional wage investments, I expect expense leverage to continue at or above 20 basis points a year., Strong growth, International growth,\\nMargin mix, Customer growth, Operating discipline, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Let me turn now specifically to our expectations for this current year. We feel very good about the underlying business and ability to compete from a position of strength. However, we\\'re still facing similar COVID-related challenges as we have over the past several quarters, which caused us to suspend guidance and continues to make short-term guidance very challenging. Despite that we want to give you the best view we can at this time given what we know and what we see right now., Underlying business, Competition,\\nCOVID-related challenges, Short-term guidance, Long-term view, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We know we\\'ll have both headwinds and tailwinds this year, the balance and degree of which isn\\'t clear. As the year progresses, we hope to get more clarity around COVID impacts, vaccine efficacy and availability, the scale and duration of economic stimulus and the mid-term economic climate globally. Even if conditions stay generally similar to now, for any length of time this year and with limited additional stimulus, we would expect continued solid underlying performance from Walmart U.S. with low-single-digit comps and continued solid eCommerce sales growth., COVID impacts, Vaccine efficacy,\\nEconomic stimulus, Mid-term economic climate, Underlying performance, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Low-single-digit comps would result in around a 10% comp growth on a two year stack basis, so very healthy growth. We would expect the level of comp growth to be more heavily weighted toward the middle of the year as a result of the timing of COVID-related demand and stimulus in FY \\'21. Now of course that could look different depending on future stimulus and/or significant changes in customer spending patterns as the COVID crisis hopefully moderates at some point., Low-single-digit comps, Comp growth,\\nTwo year stack basis, COVID-related demand, Stimulus, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The comparisons against last year are unique. There were stretches that were really strong and others less so, driven by how people responded to the virus, how they stocked up, how they responded to being at home more, and of course, stimulus actions. In International, excluding divestitures, we expect to see higher level of sales growth versus the U.S. with strength in India, Mexico and China. And at Sam\\'s, we expect low-single-digit comps excluding fuel and tobacco., Strong growth, Sales growth,\\nInternational growth, Low-single-digit comps, Stimulus actions, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Total company sales are expected to decline, due primarily to the divestiture or anticipated divestitures of businesses in the U.K., Japan and Argentina. Excluding that, we would expect total company sales to grow in the low-single-digits. From a profitability standpoint, given the assumptions mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of divestitures, we would expect operating income and EPS to be flat to up slightly versus a very strong profit year in FY \\'21., Total company sales, Sales growth,\\nOperating income, EPS, Divestiture, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In regards to the U.K. transaction, when we announced it, we said we expected EPS dilution of approximately $0.25 in the first full year assuming we held proceeds and cash. We expect to hold more cash than normal during this time due to strong cash flow, but plan to reallocate that cash in a thoughtful way in the coming quarters into new projects as well as share repurchase. We still expect to make up for the EPS hit in the mid-term, but there will be timing impacts that negatively affect FY \\'22 EPS by about $0.20. However, this should provide a tailwind to EPS growth in future years as we reallocate more of that cash. Due in large part to the International transactions, we expect operating income dollars and EPS to decline slightly in FY \\'22 on a consolidated basis, but we expect Walmart U.S. operating income to increase in spite of some continued COVID costs, accelerated technology costs and increased wages., EPS dilution, Cash flow, Share\\nrepurchase, Operating income, COVID costs, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Alternative revenue streams like advertising and Walmart fulfillment services are gaining traction and are expected to become a larger portion of profit growth in the future, including FY \\'22 along with a fairly steady gross margin rate. Due to the International transactions and FY \\'21 COVID-related expense and profit timing, we expect the FY \\'22 quarterly profit growth cadence versus last year to be quite variable. We expect Q1 operating income to be relatively flat to last year and EPS to be flat to slightly up, reflecting the presence of as in our financials for about half the quarter and some tax rate fluctuations., Alternative revenue streams, Gross\\nmargin rate, Quarterly profit growth cadence, FY \\'21 COVID-related expense, Tax rate fluctuations, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Due to the timing of FY \\'21 cost and divestitures, Q2 and Q3 operating income and EPS may be down mid to even high-single-digits with Q4 operating income and EPS potentially up mid-to-high single-digits. Again, and I probably can\\'t stress this enough, we\\'re in a very unusual time. Causing projections even in the short-term will be very challenging and open to significant fluctuation., FY \\'21 cost, Divestitures, Q2\\noperating income, Q3 operating income, Q4 operating income, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Many times I get asked by analysts, investors and others, are we missing anything about Walmart? And I thought a lot about this question lately. And even for someone like me that\\'s been here for over 20 years, I have to step back and see the evolution through a different lens. Walmart\\'s different than it was last year, three years ago, and certainly, five years ago. It\\'s faster, it\\'s more creative and it\\'s less risk averse. It\\'s actively creating its future by building on a set of unique strengths and capabilities., Evolution, Speed, Creativity, Risk\\naversion, Unique strengths, Walmart\\nWMT, 2020, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Let me describe the Walmart I want you to see. We have more customer store traffic than anyone in the world. We have one of, if not, the largest pickup businesses in the world, and we\\'re scaling delivery. We\\'re one of the largest eCommerce companies in the world, approaching $100 billion in revenue in the next couple of years, and we believe $200 billion a few years after that. We have one of the largest marketplace businesses in the world. And now, we\\'re scaling a marketplace fulfillment services business to grow even faster.

So today we\\'re reiterating the previous guidance provided in October, which speaks to the consistency of our business. I\\'ll highlight a few of the key guidance metrics and you can find a complete listing in this morning\\'s press release., Momentum, Guidance Metrics, Press\\nRelease, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll start with sales guidance. We expect to deliver total net sales growth of at least 3% on a constant-currency basis in FY 2020. With the back half of the year a little stronger than the first half, due to some timing and comparison, including the deconsolidation of Brazil and the addition of Flipkart., Sales Guidance, Total Net Sales\\nGrowth, Constant-Currency Basis, Back Half of Year, Deconsolidation of Brazil, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Keep in mind, on a reported basis, we\\'ve seen increased pressure from currency as noted in our fourth quarter results. If the current spot rates were to continue into next year, there will be currency headwind to reported sales of around $3 billion with most of that impact in the first half of the year., Currency Pressure, Reported\\nBasis, Spot Rates, First Half of Year, Impact, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For Walmart U.S., we still expect comp store growth of 2.5% to 3% despite the more difficult comparisons. We expect the quarterly cadence of comp store growth to be fairly consistent throughout the year, ranging from approximately 2.5% to 3.5% in any given quarter., Walmart U.S., Comp Store Growth,\\nQuarterly Cadence, Difficult Comparisons, Consistency, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walmart U.S. eCommerce is expected to grow sales around 35% in FY 2020 and we expect the quarterly growth to range from around 30% to below 40% range. We still expect the leverage expenses by approximately 20 basis points in FY 2020., Walmart U.S. eCommerce, Sales\\nGrowth, Quarterly Growth, Leverage Expenses, Basis Points, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We\\'ll continue to make progress on being more efficient at lowering cost, especially in Walmart U.S. stores, where we expect leverage to be even higher than the 20 basis points, due to continuing strong sales and improved productivity. On a consolidated basis, we expect to slightly lever in Q1 with leverage improving each quarter during the year. Timing of expenses can impact leverage quarter-to-quarter versus our expectations., Efficiency, Cost Lowering,\\nWalmart U.S. Stores, Leverage, Quarterly Improvement, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to profitability, we continue to expect consolidated operating income dollars to decline by low single digit percentage, primarily due to Flipkart being included for the full year versus the partial year in fiscal 2019. We would expect operating income to increase excluding the Flipkart effects., Profitability, Consolidated\\nOperating Income Dollars, Decline, Low Single Digit Percentage, Excluding Flipkart Effects, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect EPS to decline by low single digit percentage which assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 26.5% to 27.5%. Keep in mind that increase in the rate relative to FY 2019 adjusted tax rate relates to the Flipkart losses having very little tax benefit in the near term which we\\'ve mentioned previously., EPS, Low Single Digit Percentage,\\nEffective Tax Rate, Flipkart Losses, Adjusted Tax Rate, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Excluding the full year EPS dilution expected from Flipkart, we would expect EPS to grow by a low- to mid-single digit percentage. As you would expect, the quarterly year-over-year change in operating income and EPS will be quite varied during the year due primarily to the impact of Flipkart only being in our results in part Q3 and all of Q4 last year., EPS Growth, Low-Mid Single Digit\\nPercentage, Quarterly Change, Flipkart Impact, Operating Income, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We currently expect operating income and EPS to decrease by around 10% in Q1 decrease by a low to mid-single digit percentage in Q2 and Q3 and increase in Q4 to achieve our full year guidance. As always, the growth quarter-to-quarter can change due to timing and other factors., Operating Income, EPS, Quarterly\\nChange, Growth, Timing Factors, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our priorities for capital allocation remains unchanged.

And we continue with our current share repurchase program., Capital Allocation, Investing,\\nGrowth Initiatives, Dividend, Share Repurchase Program, Walmart\\nWMT, 2019, 4, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Before I close, I want to share a change in the communication cadence with the analysts and investors. Similar to the past, we will host the question-and-answer session in Northwest Arkansas in June in conjunction with our annual shareholders meeting. However, instead of hosting an investment community meeting in October as we typically have, we plan to have an event in February 2020 in New York in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release. This meeting will be similar to the format we typically had, where you\\'ll hear updates on our performance, guidance and strategy and interact with key leaders but a location that\\'s closer to many of you.

We continue to see strong momentum in the Walmart U.S. business with both comp transactions and comp ticket growth. As you saw, Q3 comps were, in the US, up 3.4%, and on a two-year stack basis, were up 6.1%. It has been well over 10 years since we have seen back-to-back orders with two-year stack comps above 6%. So we\\'re pleased with the momentum in the business., Strong Momentum, Walmart U.S.,\\nComp Transactions, Comp Ticket Growth, Q3 Comps, Walmart\\nWMT, 2018, 3, Dan Binder, Vice President, Investor Relations, At the time of our last call, we were about halfway through the back-to-school season, and I told you that we were seeing strength in that business. I\\'m pleased to say that the season wrapped up with solid results and then we ended the quarter with strong sales of fall seasonal goods, including Halloween. While we don\\'t breakout grocery comp specifically, I will tell you that it was the best two-year stack comp in nearly nine years. I just wanted to point out that the hurricanes last year obviously provided us with some tough compares in that category and we were pleased with the momentum despite that tough comparison and particularly with fresh., Strength, Back-to-School Season,\\nSolid Results, Fall Seasonal Goods, Grocery Comps, Walmart\\nWMT, 2018, 3, Dan Binder, Vice President, Investor Relations, As you also saw in today\\'s release, US eCommerce sales grew 43%, keeping us on track to achieve about 40% growth for the year.

Operator, if we could get started. Thanks., Operator, Questions, Call,\\nStarted, Thanks, Walmart\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\\'s call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company\\'s public statements and reports filed with the SEC., Risks and uncertainties, forward-looking statements, Private Securities Litigation\\nReform Act of 1995, actual events, performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal \\'23, the 17 weeks ended September 3rd. These results and the figures presented today compared to last fiscal year\\'s 16-week fourth quarter. Reported net income for the 17-week fourth quarter came in at $2.16 billion, or $4.86 per diluted share, compared to $1.868 billion or $4.20 per diluted share in the 16-week fourth quarter last year., Forward-looking statements, operating results, net income, fiscal year, diluted share, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of sales, net sales for the 17-week fourth quarter were $77.43 billion, an increase of 9.4% from $70.76 billion in the 16-week fourth quarter last year. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter, and these figures are like-for-like number of weeks, in the U.S., reported was a 0.2% comp. Excluding gas deflation and FX, in the U.S., it would have been a 3.1%. Canada reported was a 1.8%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, 7.4%., Sales, net sales, comparable sales, comp, FX, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Other international reported 5.5%. And again, excluding gas deflation and FX, 4.4%. All told, total company reported 1.1% comp and a 3.8% ex gas deflation and FX. In terms of e-commerce, that loss came in at a minus 0.8% reported and a minus 0.6% excluding FX., Sales, net sales, comparable sales, comp, FX, e-commerce, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Overall, for the fiscal fourth quarter, food and sundries were relatively strong once again, with fresh foods right behind and with some offsets on some of the nonfood categories. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.2% worldwide and 5% in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was down 3.9% worldwide and down 4.5% in the U.S., impacted in large part from weakness in bigger ticket nonfood discretionary items, as well as the gas price deflation. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S., Fiscal fourth quarter, food and sundries, fresh foods, nonfood categories, Q4 comp sales metrics,\\ntraffic or shopping frequency, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately three-tenths of a percent, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%. Next on the income statement, membership fee income reported in the fourth quarter, $1.509 million -- billion, or 1.95% of sales in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, compared to $1.327 million -- billion or 1.88% in Q4 of last year. So, $182 million increase or 13.7%. If you adjust for the extra week, the 13.7% would be roughly a 7% that extra week., dollar, gasoline price deflation, membership fee income, sales, extra week, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Excluding FX and the extra week, the increase would have been around 7.5%. In terms of renewal rates, at Q4-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates stood at 92.7%, which is up a tenth of a percent from the 92.6% figure as of the end of Q3. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, down a tenth of a percent, reflecting the impact of increasing penetration of memberships from international, which renew at a lower rate, in large part, because of new openings internationally., excluding FX, extra week, renewal rates, U.S., Canada, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Membership growth continues. We ended fourth quarter with 71.0 million paid household members, up 7.9% versus a year ago; and 127.9 million cardholders, up 7.6%. And that\\'s on new openings over the past year of -- just under 3% increase in new locations. At fourth quarter-end, we had 32.3 million paid executive memberships, an increase of 981,000 during the 17 weeks since Q3-end., membership growth, paid household members, cardholders, new openings, executive memberships, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, The executive members now represent a little over 45% of our paid membership and approximately -- paid members and approximately 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter came in higher, came in at 10.60%, up 42 basis points from 10.18% a year ago, and up 42 basis points is up 16 basis points excluding gas deflation. As I always ask you to jot down a few numbers with two columns, both reported and excluding gas deflation., executive members, paid membership, gross margin, sales, gas deflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, The first line item would be core merchandise, on a reported basis, up 51 basis points year over year in the fourth quarter; and ex of gas deflation, up 28 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, a minus 32 and a minus 38; 2% Reward, minus 4 and minus 2; LIFO, plus 27 and plus 28. And you total that up, on a reported basis, gross margin was up 42 basis points year over year, and ex gas deflation up 16 basis points. Starting with the core, again, a 51 year over year; and ex deflation, up 28., core merchandise, ancillary and other businesses, 2% Reward, LIFO, gross margin, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 35 basis points, with food and sundries and nonfoods being up and fresh foods being down a little. Ancillary and other business gross margin was lower by 32 basis points and lower by 38 basis points ex gas. This was driven almost entirely by gas. If you look at the other components of ancillary and other, which would include pharmacy, e-com, food court, business centers, optical, all those things on a relative basis year over year were within a couple of basis points plus or minus from a year earlier., core\\nmargin, sales, food and sundries, nonfoods, fresh foods, ancillary and other business, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, 2% Reward, higher by 4 basis points and higher by higher by 2 basis points. So, a negative 2 basis points excluding gas deflation. That represents higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. And LIFO, of course, if you recall last year in Q4, we had a $223 million pre-tax LIFO charge., 2% Reward, sales penetration, executive members, LIFO, pre-tax LIFO charge, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, While there was a small charge this year of $30 million on a year-over-year basis, of course, that showed the basis-point improvement in margin. While we continue -- we\\'ve continued to see sequential improvement in year-over-year inflation, I\\'ll talk about that a little later, we\\'ve still had a small amount relative to the first day of the fiscal year. That\\'s the small charge in Q4. A couple of final comments on margins., small charge, sequential improvement, inflation, margin, fiscal year, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, First, we are off -- we are asked often recently about our inventory shrinkage results and whether it has dramatically increased in the past year versus historical shrink results. The answer is no. In the past several years, our inventory shrink has increased by a couple of basis points, in part, we believe, due to the rollout of self-checkout. Over the past year, it has increased by less than 1 basis point more., inventory shrinkage, historical shrink results, self-checkout, past year, basis points, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, So, no, thankfully, not a big issue for us. And second, our year-over-year margin improvement has, in part, been due to fewer markdowns due to better inventory positions this year than last. Our inventories, overall, are in good shape. Moving on to SG&A., inventory positions, markdowns, SG&A, margin improvement, year-over-year, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter, 8.96%, up from 8.53% a year earlier, or up 43 basis points; and ex gas deflation, up 21 basis points. Again, jot down the two columns of numbers, both reported and excluding gas deflation. Operations, minus 37 basis point, minus being higher by. And without deflation, core would be minus 18., SG&A, fourth quarter, basis points, gas deflation, operations, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Central, minus 6 and minus 3. And those are the really only two line items. The others were all zero: stock compensation, pre-opening, and other. So, total reported margins were up 43 basis points year over year; and ex gas deflation, up 21 basis points., central, stock compensation, pre-opening, other, total reported margins, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of the core operations being higher by 18 ex gas deflation and on a reported basis higher by 37, this negative included the impact of lower sales growth, as well as the impact of eight weeks of additional top-of-scale wage increases that went into effect July 4th of \\'22, so midway through Q4 last year. And a full 17 weeks of this past March is higher than normal top-of-scale increase. Central being higher by 3 basis points ex gas deflation. Again, not a lot of sales operating leverage there., core operations, sales growth, top-of-scale wage increases, central, sales operating leverage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, And again, I as mentioned, the other line items that I typically read out were flat, both with and without gas deflation, so zero year-over-year change. Below the operating income line. Interest expense came in at $56 million this year versus $48 million a year ago, one extra week, of course. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 171 million year over year, 238 million this year versus 67 million last year., interest expense, interest income, other, operating income, quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, This was driven, in large part, by an increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates and higher cash balances, as well as the extra week. In addition, FX was slightly favorable year over year. In terms of income tax rate, our tax rate this year in the fourth quarter came in 27.1%, compared to 25.4% in Q4 last year, so a full 1.7 percentage points higher year over year. This increase in our rate as of Q4 is primarily attributable to an increased penetration of international earnings, which overall incurs a higher income tax rate than in the U.S., interest income, interest rates, FX, income tax rate, international earnings, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Overall reported net income was up 16% year over year in the quarter or 9% if you adjust for the extra week this year -- quarter -- this year and fourth quarter versus last. A few other items of note. In the fourth quarter, we opened nine net new warehouses, including five new buildings in the U.S., two in China, and one each in Japan and Australia. That -- for the full fiscal \\'23 year, we finished with 23 net new units, as well as we did three relocations., reported net income, extra week, warehouses, full fiscal \\'23 year, relocations, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, And for the first quarter, the first 12 weeks of fiscal \\'24, we plan on opening 10 net new units and as well relocating one unit. All 10 locations net new, nine are in the U.S. and one in Canada. Regarding capital expenditures, we\\'ve actually included the cash flow in the quarter report, but capex spend in Q4 was approximately 1.56 billion., first quarter, fiscal \\'24, capital expenditures, cash flow, locations, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, And for all of fiscal \\'23, it totaled 4.32 billion. Turning to e-commerce. E-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX, as I mentioned, decreased six-tenths of a percent year over year. While still negative, relatively speaking, our e-commerce showed good improvement., e-commerce sales, FX, fourth quarter, fiscal \\'23, improvement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Results showed good improvement this quarter versus our year-over-year results in Q2 and Q3. In the previous two fiscal quarters, big-ticket discretionary, majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry, and hardware, were down 15% and 20% year over year, respectively, and down just 5% year over year in the fourth quarter, with those big-ticket departments making up over half of our e-commerce sales. A couple of other items of note. Within the sales of big-ticket discretionary, appliance were up over 30% in the quarter., good improvement, year-over-year results, big-ticket discretionary, appliances, sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Second, I\\'ve gotten a couple of calls that people have seen online that we\\'ve been selling one-ounce gold bars, yes, but when we load them on the site, they\\'re typically gone within a few hours and we limit two per member. And lastly, I\\'ll point out Costco Next. We continue to grow that. We currently have 60 -- 62 suppliers on costconext.com, and we continue to onboard additional ones in many product areas, from home improvement to apparel, to pet, to home and kitchen, to electronics and accessories, to sports and bicycles and toys, and the like., selling one-ounce gold bars, online sales, Costco Next, suppliers, onboarding, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Excuse me. Now, a few comments on e-com, mobile, digital efforts, which were always asked about. As I discussed during the last quarter earnings call, when I said that we were in the early innings of our digital mobile transformation efforts, progress is being made. In terms of recent additions and upgrades, we\\'ve recently redesigned account -- the account page and the digital membership card., e-com, mobile, digital efforts, progress, recent additions, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, We also redesigned the header with larger search bar and expanded selling space. We\\'ve added an app box for messages and advertisements right in the app. We\\'ve recently, a few months ago, opened an optical digital store where you can virtually try on glasses and then order them for pickup, prescription glasses. And lastly, there are ongoing improvement in our Costco app, offering in-warehouse shopping tools to our customers such as a digital membership card, managing shopping lists, viewing warehouse savings, seeing the gas prices to the extent there\\'s a gas station there., redesigned header, app box, optical digital store, in-warehouse shopping tools, ongoing\\nimprovement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, And soon, you\\'ll be able to search warehouse inventory and scan barcodes from the app. With the improvements made thus far over the past year, our app store rating has gone from a dismal 2.3 stars to currently 4.7 stars. Unique visitors in the site are up 40% year over year, and the Costco app installs are up 46% year over year. So, all in all, progress is being made., search warehouse inventory, scan barcodes, app store rating, unique visitors, Costco app installs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Lastly, a couple of comments regarding inflation. Most recently, in Q3 \\'23, we had estimated that year-over-year inflation was in the 3% to 4% range. Our estimate for Q4 inflation is in the 1% to 2% range, and it\\'s actually trended downward during the quarter. So, hopefully, these inflation trends will continue., inflation, Q3 \\'23, Q4 inflation, trended downward, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, We\\'ll have to see. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we\\'ll announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, October 1st on Wednesday, October 4th after the market closes.

The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\\'s call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company\\'s public statements and reports filed with the SEC., forward-looking statements, Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, risks and\\nuncertainties, actual events, performance differences, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the 12 weeks ended this past May 7. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.30 billion or $2.93 per diluted share. This compared to $1.35 billion or $3.04 per diluted share a year ago in the third quarter., forward-looking statements, operating results, net income, diluted share, year-over-year\\ncomparison, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, This year\\'s results included a nonrecurring charge to merchandise costs of $298 million pre-tax or $0.50 per share, primarily for the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities. Last year\\'s results included a nonrecurring $77 million pre-tax charge or $0.13 per share for incremental employee benefits. As many of you know, two years ago, we initially leased three ships and thousands of containers to help mitigate some of the significant overseas freight challenges that we were experiencing. Later, we added four additional vessels and several thousand additional containers with commitments made for up to then three additional years., nonrecurring charge, merchandise costs, discontinuation of charter shipping activities,\\nnonrecurring charge employee benefits, freight challenges, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Procuring these ships and containers was integral to us being able to stay in stock for our members during those challenging times. It also allowed us to do so initially at a lower cost than the market rates at that time. Shipping and freight markets have improved dramatically since that time, which led us to reevaluate our position. As you recall, in the first quarter of this fiscal year, we took a charge to downsize by two vessels our charter shipping activities., procurement, stock availability, market rates, shipping markets, downsizing, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Since then, shipping and container rates have continued to fall. And in the third quarter, this third quarter, we concluded that it would be appropriate to completely discontinue the remainder of our charter shipping activities. As a result of this decision, we recorded an impairment charge for all remaining charter assets. This decision allows our merchandising teams to take full advantage of the current shipping market rates as opposed to much higher contracted charter rates., shipping and container rates, third quarter decision, impairment charge, merchandising teams,\\nshipping market rates, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In turn, this allows us to do what we do best and lower prices for our members. In terms of sales. Net sales for the third quarter increased 1.9% to $52.6 billion versus $51.61 billion reported last year in the third quarter. Comparable sales for the quarter were as follows: in the U.S., on a reported basis, minus 0.1%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, plus 1.8%; Canada, reported, minus 1%, ex gas and FX, plus 7.4%; and Other International, reported, plus 4.1%, and ex gas and FX, plus 8.4%., net\\nsales, third quarter, comparable sales, U.S., Canada, Other International, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, So total company, on a reported basis, 0.3% comp sales, and ex gas deflation and FX at plus 3.5%. And our e-commerce on a reported basis was minus 10% and minus 9%, excluding FX. In terms of third quarter comp sales metrics. Traffic or shopping frequency remains pretty good, increasing 4.8% worldwide and 3.5% in the U.S., total company, comparable sales, e-commerce, third quarter metrics, traffic or shopping frequency, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, during the quarter. Our average daily transaction or ticket was down 4.2% worldwide and down 3.5% in the U.S., impacted, in large part, from weakness in bigger-ticket nonfood discretionary items. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.5%, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.7%., average daily transaction, ticket, weakness in bigger-ticket nonfood discretionary items, foreign\\ncurrencies, gasoline price deflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement is membership fee income. For the quarter, we reported $1.044 billion of membership fee income or 1.98% of sales compared to $984 million or 1.91% a year ago in the third quarter, so a $60 million or 6.1% increase in membership fees. Excluding the headwinds in FX, the $60 million increase would have been higher by $17 million or up year over year 8%, adjusted for FX. In terms of renewal rates, at third quarter end, our U.S., membership fee income, sales, third quarter, membership fees, FX, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, and Canada renewal rate was 92.6%, and our worldwide rate came in at 90.5%. These figures are the same all-time high renewal rates that were achieved in the second quarter, just 12 weeks ago here. Membership growth continues. We ended Q3 with 69.1 paid household members and 124.7 million cardholders, both up approximately 7% versus a year ago., membership growth, renewal rates, paid household members, cardholders, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, At third quarter end, we had 31.3 million paid executive members, an increase of 681,000 or 57,000 per week during the 12-week fiscal third quarter. Executive members now represent a little over 45% of our paid members and approximately 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement. Next is our gross margin., paid executive members, paid members, sales, gross margin, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was higher year over year on a reported basis by 13 basis points, coming in at 10.32% as compared to a 10.19% number a year earlier. The 13 basis point positive ex gas deflation was minus 3 basis points. Both of these numbers, of course, includes a little more than 50 basis point impairment charge to margin mentioned in today\\'s earnings release. As I normally do, I\\'ll ask you to jot down a few numbers, two columns: a reported column and then column excluding gas deflation., gross margin, third quarter, reported basis, ex gas deflation, impairment charge, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, The first item would be, for the third quarter of \\'23, core merchandise margin. On a reported basis, it was up year over year 39 basis points and ex gas deflation, up 24; ancillary and other, plus 13 and plus nine; 2% Reward, minus 11 and minus nine; LIFO, plus 25 and plus 25; and other, minus 53 and minus 52. If you add up the two columns, again, you get to the reported number of, on a reported basis, gross margin year over year in the quarter was up 13 basis points, and ex gas deflation, down 3 basis points. So starting over the core., core\\nmerchandise margin, third quarter, reported basis, ancillary and other, LIFO, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Again, core was up, on a reported basis, 39 basis points year over year and 24 ex gas deflation. In terms of core margins on their own core sales, or core-on-core margins, they were higher by 17 basis points, with food and sundries and nonfoods being up and fresh foods being down a little. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 13 and again higher by nine ex gas deflation. Within the ancillary businesses, gasoline, business centers, food court and travel were better year over year, offset in part by e-com., core\\nmargins, reported basis, ex gas deflation, ancillary businesses, fresh foods, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, 2% Reward, again, higher by 11 basis points and higher by nine ex gas deflation. Higher sales penetration coming from our executive members is certainly part of that. LIFO, plus 25 basis points year over year, both with and without gas deflation. As you recall, a year ago, in the third quarter, we had $130 million charge for LIFO., 2% Reward, executive members, LIFO, sales penetration, third quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In this fiscal year, we had no LIFO charge. So $130 million year-over-year improvement on that line item. Note also that in the fourth quarter a year ago, we had a $223 million LIFO charge. So we\\'ll see how that goes in the fourth quarter this year., LIFO, fourth quarter, fiscal year, sales penetration, charge, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Other was lower by 53 basis points reported and 52 ex gas deflation. This was net of items for both years. This year, there was a 57 basis point negative impact from the $298 million pre-tax charge, again, primarily related to terminating our charter shipping activities. This was partially offset by lapping last year\\'s $77 million charge for incremental employee benefits, of which $20 million or 4 basis points related to gross margin., other, pre-tax charge, employee benefits, gross margin, chargelapse, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, The remaining $57 million, I\\'ll talk about it in a minute under SG&A. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A this year was nine.11% compared to 8.62% a year ago. So on a reported basis, higher by 49 basis points, and ex gas deflation, higher by 34%., SG&A, reported basis, ex gas deflation, year ago, remaining $57 million, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, As with gross margin, I\\'ll ask you to jot down two columns of numbers, both reported and one excluding gas deflation. First item is operations, higher by 48 basis points and minus 35 basis points; central, minus 11 and minus nine; stock compensation, zero in both columns; preopening, minus one and minus one; other, plus 11 and plus 11. If you add all those up, again, on a reported basis, 49 basis points higher year over year, and ex gas deflation, 34. Now, to core operations., operations, central, stock compensation, preopening, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, This negative included, of course, the impact of slower sales growth, as well as the impact of a few of the wage increases that we did that are typically out of the normal cycle over the last year -- over a year. And that included the impact of four weeks of wage and benefits increases implemented last March, the additional top-of-scale increase that went into effect July 4, and eight weeks of this March is higher than normal top-of-scale increase. Despite the slowing sales growth, we\\'ve continued to invest in our employees over the past year, and that\\'s always been a priority for us. Central, higher by 11 and higher by nine ex gas deflation., wage increases, sales growth, employees, investment, central, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Again, sales growth -- there\\'s no big single item that was an outlier there. But sales growth overall, in my view, was the impact. Stock comp, flat both with and without gas deflation, so no impact there. Preopening again, higher by 1 basis point., sales growth, stock comp, preopening, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, We had five openings this year in the quarter and three last year but, again, 1 basis point delta year over year. And Other, 11 basis point positive, both with and without gas deflation. This is a result of lapping that $77 million charge, within SG&A, lapping $57 million of that $77 million charge for the incremental employee benefits, again, discussed earlier in the release. Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $36 million, $1 million over last year\\'s $35 million number., openings, delta, other, SG&A, interest expense, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $57 million year over year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and cash balances. And an increase in interest income was partially offset by less favorable FX versus last year. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 26.5%., interest income, interest rates, cash balances, income taxes, tax rate, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, That compared to 24.9% in Q3 last year. The fiscal \\'23 effective rate, excluding discrete items, is currently projected to be in the 26% to 27% range. Overall, reported net income was down year over year by 4 percentage points, net of the two nonrecurring items in both years\\' third quarters. Net income would have been up 8% even being reflected with that higher income tax rate., net income, income tax rate, effective rate, discrete items, nonrecurring items, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of warehouse expansion, to date, we\\'ve opened 17 locations in the first three quarters and also including three relocations, so net of that, 14 net new locations. In Q4, we have nine new openings with no relos, so net of nine. That will put us at 26 openings, less the three relos, to be a 23 net new for this year. In the quarter, again, we opened five, with four being net new., warehouse expansion, locations, openings, relos, quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In addition to the relocation in Canada, we had two new buildings in the U.S. opened, and one additional building opened in each of Japan and China. Again, of the nine new buildings planned for our fiscal fourth quarter, that includes our North Tulsa, Oklahoma opening that opened this morning, and our fourth and fifth buildings in China planned for June and August. These Q4 planned openings will bring our full year account to 26 less the three, or net of 23, and that is made up of 13 in the U.S., new\\nbuildings, relocation, openings, planned openings, full year account, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, and 10 outside of the U.S.\\xa0 Regarding capital expenditures. In Q3 of the fiscal year, we spent approximately $819 million. Our estimate for all of fiscal \\'23, capex is approximately $4 billion. Moving on to e-commerce., capex, spending, e-commerce, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, You saw in the release that e-commerce was a minus 10% sales decline on a comp basis and ex FX, minus 9%. E-com sales, more to the same story in terms of the sales, as I discussed on our second quarter call and in our monthly sales recordings. In Q3, big-ticket discretionary departments, notably majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry and hardware, were down about 20% in e-com and made up 55% of e-com sales. These same departments were down about 17% in warehouse, but they only make up 8% in warehouse sales., e-commerce, sales, departments, warehouse, quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, A few comments on inflation. Inflation continues to abate somewhat. If you go back a year ago to the fourth quarter of \\'22 last summer, we had estimated that year over year inflation at the time was up 8%. And by Q1 and Q2, it was down to 6% and 7% and then 5% and 6%., inflation, quarter, year, estimated, abate, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In this quarter, we\\'re estimating the year over year inflation in the 3% to 4% range. We continue to see improvements in many items, notably food items like nuts, eggs and meat, as well as items that include, as part of their components, commodities like steel and resins on the nonfood side. Switching over to inventory levels. Inventories overall are in pretty good shape., inflation, quarter, year, estimated, improvements, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, As of quarter end, our inventories year over year as of the end of the third quarter were down 7%. Recall that they had been up during some of the supply chain challenges of last year. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, May 28, next Thursday on June 1, after market close. And also remember that our fiscal fourth quarter has an extra week this year., Inventories, supply chain challenges, upcoming sales results, fiscal fourth\\nquarter, extra week, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, So our quarter ending September 3, 2023, will have 17 weeks versus 16 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter. With that, I\\'ll open it up for questions and answers and turn it back over to Josh.

The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\\'s call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company\\'s public statements and reports filed with the SEC., Forward-looking statements, Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\\nrisks and uncertainties, actual events, performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are being made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal \\'23, the 12 weeks ended this past February 12th, as well as February retail sales for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26th. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.466 billion or $3.30 per share, compared to $1.299 billion or $2.92 a share -- per diluted share last year, an increase of 13%. In terms of sales, net sales for the second quarter increased 6.5% to $54.24 billion, compared to $50.94 billion reported a year ago in the second quarter., Forward-looking statements, operating results, net income, sales, second quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Comparable sales for the second quarter were as follows: in the U.S., 5.7% for the 12-week period. Excluding gas inflation, 5.8%; Canada, 3.5% reported.

Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.002% worldwide and up 1.9% in the U.S. during Q2. Foreign currencies relative to the dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.8%, and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales very slightly by approximately 0.2%., Second quarter comp sales metrics, traffic, shopping frequency, average\\ntransaction, foreign currencies, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll review our February sales results later in the call. Next on the income statement is membership fee income reported in the second quarter, $1.027 billion of membership fee income or 1.89%. That\\'s for this year\\'s second quarter, compared to $967 million a year earlier. So a $60 million increase in dollars or up 6.2%., February sales results, membership fee income, second quarter, dollar, increase, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Excluding the headwinds in FX, the $60 million increase would have been higher by $20 million additional. So on an FX-adjusted basis, membership fee income was up just over eight percentage points. In terms of renewal rates, at second quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates -- our U.S., Excluding headwinds in FX, membership fee income, renewal rates, U.S., Canada, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, and Canada renewal rate was 92.6%, up 0.01% from Q1 end and worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, also up 0.01% from the prior quarter, both represent all-time highs.

Executive members now represent 45% of paid members and about 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement next on our -- is our gross margin on a reported basis. Gross margin was higher year over year by eight basis points, coming in at 10.72% as a percent of sales as compared to a year earlier second quarter at 10.64%., membership growth, executive members, gross margin, sales, percent, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Now the eight basis points up, and then excluding gas inflation, it have been up nine basis points. As I always ask you to draw a little chart with two columns, reported and excluding gas inflation, and then we\\'ll go down the line items. Core merchandise was minus six basis points reported and also minus six ex inflation -- gas inflation. Ancillary businesses were plus two and plus three basis points year over year, 2% reward, minus two and minus two basis points., core merchandise, ancillary businesses, gas inflation, reported, excluding gas\\ninflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, LIFO, since we had a charge last year and nothing this fiscal quarter, it was plus 14 and plus 14.

Our core merchandise grow margin again was lower by six basis points year over year., LIFO, core merchandise, growth margin, reported, excluding gas inflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margin, if you will, it was lower year over year by 26 basis points. Most major departments in general were down, with fresh foods being down a little more than others. We\\'re continuing to hold or drop prices where we can due to drive traffic and improve our competitive advantage. Overall, core sales benefited from sales shifting from ancillary and other businesses to core., core margin, sales, departments, prices, competitive advantage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Ancillary and other businesses gross margins, again, were higher by two and three basis points ex gas in the quarter. Gas business centers and travel were better year over year, offset in part by e-com and pharmacy. 2% reward lower by two basis points, that\\'s reflective of the higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, as I mentioned, was a year-over-year variance of plus 14 basis points., ancillary businesses, gross margins, gas business centers, e-com, pharmacy, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, We had no LIFO charge this fiscal quarter compared to a $71 million charge in Q2 last year. Moving on to expenses, SG&A. Our reported SG&A for the second quarter was higher year over year by 13 basis points.

First column being reported, the second ex gas inflation. Operations was down -- higher -- I said, minus two basis points higher by two basis points, so minus two and minus two; central, minus nine and minus nine, so higher year over year in central by nine basis points; stock compensation, minus two and minus two; and then all told, that would be 13 basis points higher, both on a reported basis and ex gas inflation. The core operations component of SG&A, again, higher by two basis points and also higher by two ex inflation., operations, central, stock compensation, reported, ex gas inflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, This includes the wage and benefits increases implemented last March and last year\\'s third fiscal quarter and last year\\'s third fiscal quarter and an additional top-of-scale wage increase that went into effect July 4th, which was in our fourth quarter of last year. Central, as I mentioned, was higher by nine basis points year over year. About half of this increase is a charge related to a tax audit covering several prior years. Stock comp pretty much as expected, just a couple of basis points., wage and benefits, implemented, last March, last year\\'s third fiscal quarter,\\nadditional top-of-scale wage increase, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Below the operating income line, interest expense was $34 million this year. $2 million lower than the $36 million figure in Q2 of last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $89 million year over year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates being earned and on higher cash balances., interest expense, interest income, other, rates, balances, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, The increase in interest income was slightly offset by unfavorable FX.

Our estimate for the year remains in the range of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion based on timing. In terms of e-commerce, as I mentioned, e-commerce sales in Q2, FX decreased 8.7%., Warehouse expansion, China warehouses, global expansion, capital expenditures, e-commerce, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, This weakness was driven mostly by our online mix of sales. Big-ticket discretionary departments like majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry, hardware. These were down 15% in the quarter and make up 58% of our e-comm sales. These same departments, by the way, were down 11% in warehouse, but only make up 8% of warehouse -- total warehouse in-line sales., Warehouse sales, e-commerce sales, big-ticket departments, quarterly sales, department performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Now a few comments regarding inflation. It continues to seem to improve somewhat. Recall back in the fourth fiscal quarter, which ended last August, our estimated year-over-year price inflation was 8% for that prior fiscal year. During Q1, the estimate on a year-over-year basis was about -- came down to 6% to 7%., Inflation, price inflation, year-over-year basis, quarterly basis, estimated inflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In Q2, we estimate that the equivalent year-over-year inflation number has come down to 5% to 6% range and even a little lower than that toward the end of the quarter according to the buyers. We continue to see some improvements in many items. Commodity prices are starting to fall not to back to pre-COVID levels and some examples, but continue to provide some relief, things like chicken, bacon, butter, steel, resin, nuts. Switching over to our inventory levels., Inflation, commodity prices, inventory levels, quarterly estimates, year-over-year basis, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Again, both in Q3 and Q4 fiscal year ends a year -- in fiscal \\'22. On a year-over-year basis, our inventories were up 26% year over year. And then in our first quarter of this year, they were up 10%, so good improvement there. As of this quarter end, our inventory year over year at the -- as of the end of Q2 was down 2% year over year., Warehouse sales, e-commerce sales, big-ticket departments, quarterly sales, department performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Regarding the 2% drop, we were a bit over inventoried last year as a result of supply chain challenges causing inventory to be backed up at the ports. And talking to the buyers a year ago, the estimate of just timing of getting things across the ocean was 70-plus days. Today, it\\'s back down to 30-ish days. And so we -- supply chain improvement across the board and rates, of course, coming down., Warehouse sales, e-commerce sales, big-ticket departments, quarterly sales, department performance,\\nsupply chain challenges, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Now turning out to our February sales, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26th. As reported in our release, net sales for the month were $17.06 billion, an increase of 4.7% from $16.29 billion a year earlier in the month of February. Recall from January sales results that the Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year occurred on January 22nd of this year, 10 days earlier this year, the shift positively impacted February\\'s Other International by about 2% and total company by about 0.25%. Additionally, February\\'s results for both the U.S., Warehouse sales, e-commerce sales, big-ticket departments, quarterly sales, department performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, and total company were negatively impacted by approximately 1% we estimate as a result of substantially worse weather this year over year. I believe most of that was on the traffic side rather than ticket side.

The U.S. regions with the strongest comp sales were the Midwest, the Northeast, and the Southeast. In terms of whether in international and local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Spain, U.K., and Mexico., regional sales, merchandising categories, U.S. regions, international sales, company performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Year-over-year inflation for food and sundries and fresh foods while still elevated or at their lowest levels in nearly a year, with food and sundries inflation dropping to the high single digits and fresh foods to the low to mid-single digits.

I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\\'s call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company\\'s public statements and reports filed with the SEC., forward-looking statements, Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, risk and\\nuncertainties, company\\'s public statements, SEC filings, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal \\'23, the 12 weeks ended this past November 20. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.364 billion or $3.07 per diluted share. That compared to $1.324 billion or $2.98 a share last year., forward-looking statements, operating results, net income, quarterly earnings, company performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, This year\\'s results included a charge of $93 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share, primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities, and a tax benefit of $53 million or $0.12 per diluted share related to stock-based compensation. Last year\\'s results included an asset write-off of $118 million pre-tax or $0.20 per diluted share and a tax benefit of $91 million or $0.21 a share related to stock-based compensation. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar resulted in our foreign company earnings translating into fewer U.S., charge related to downsizing, tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, asset write-off,\\nforeign company earnings translation, strength of U.S. dollar, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, dollars. With 25% to 30% of our earnings generally -- generated outside of the United States, this negatively impacted earnings by about $0.12 per share. In terms of sales, net sales for the first quarter increased 8.1% or $53.44 billion versus $49.42 billion reported last year. On a comparable sales basis during the first quarter, reported U.S., earnings impacted, sales increase, comparable sales, foreign earnings, U.S. dollar impact, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, sales increased over the 12 weeks 9.3%; and excluding gas inflation and FX, 6.5%; Canada, 2.4%; reported 8.3% increase, ex gas inflation and FX. Other International reported minus 3.1%; excluding gas inflation, FX, plus 9.1%. So, you have, all told, 6.6% reported for the company and ex-gas inflation and FX of 7.1%. E-commerce, by the way, was reported of minus 3.7% and a minus 2%, excluding FX., sales increase, foreign earnings, e-commerce, gas inflation, currency impact, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of first-quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.9% worldwide and up 2.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction size was up 2.6% worldwide and 6.9% U.S. during the first quarter. And foreign currencies relative to the U.S., traffic, shopping frequency, average transaction size, foreign currencies, U.S. performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, dollar negatively impacted sales by a little over 3%, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%. Moving down the income statement. Membership fee income reported in the quarter, our membership fee income came in right at $1 billion. That\\'s $54 million or 5.7% higher than last year\\'s reported number of $946 million., dollar impact, gas price inflation, membership fee income, sales impact, U.S. performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Again, the relative weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, excluding the impact of FX, we\\'re assuming flat FX year over year, that $54 million number would have been increased by $32 million, and the membership on an adjusted basis would have been a little over 9% year over year on flat FX. In terms of renewal rates, at first quarter-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates were 92.5% compared to 92.4% a quarter ago., foreign currencies, FX impact, membership growth, renewal rates, U.S./Canada performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, And worldwide rate came in both at this quarter-end and the previous quarter-end, the same level at 90.4%. We ended first quarter with 66.9 million paying household members and 120.9 million cardholders, both up 7% versus last year, and recognize we added about 22 units over the course of that last year. So, that was about just under 3% of that increase. At Q1 end, paid executive memberships were right at 30 million, an increase of 904,000 during the 12 weeks or 75,000 a week during the first quarter., paying household members, cardholders, paid executive memberships, membership growth, unit\\naddition, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Executive members now represent 45% of our paid membership and just under 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement to gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the first quarter was lower year over year by 45 basis points and lower by 21 basis points, excluding gas inflation. And as I\\'ll explain in a minute, the 93% pre-tax charge, excluding that 93% -- $93 million charge we took in the quarter, gross margin ex gas inflation would have been only down three basis points., executive members, paid membership, worldwide sales, gross margin, pre-tax charge, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, As I always ask you, jot down the following numbers: two columns and six line items. The first column is reported during the first quarter, a year-over-year delta change in basis points, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. On a core merchandise basis, we reported in the first quarter, minus 52 basis points; and ex-gas inflation, minus 31 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 23% on a reported basis and plus 30%; 2% reward, minus two and minus five; LIFO plus three and plus three; other, that\\'s the $93 million charge, minus 17 and minus 18., reported basis, ex-gas inflation, core merchandise basis, ancillary businesses, $93 million charge, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, So, all told, again, reported basis was 45, ex gas inflation, 21. So, starting with the core. Core merchandise\\'s contribution to gross margin on a reported basis was lower by 52 basis points year over year and lower by 31 basis points ex-gas inflation. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the first quarter, our core or core gross margin, if you will, was also lower by 31 basis points, with food and sundries being up a little bit, offset by nonfoods and fresh foods being down., core merchandise, gross margin, contribution to gross margin, core margin, sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Fresh foods was down. As you know, for the last couple of years, it\\'s been particularly strong, and it\\'s come down a little bit. In addition, we are looking to hold prices on some of those price points despite inflated costs in some of the fresh food categories. Ancillary and other business gross margins were higher by 23 and higher by 30 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter, with gas, business centers, and travel up year over year, offset in part by e-comm, food courts, and optical., fresh foods, prices, inflation, ancillary businesses, e-comm, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Our 2% reward, minus two basis points; reported, minus 5%, excluding gas inflation, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, plus three basis points. We had a very small LIFO charge this year but lapped a $14 million charge in Q1 last year. You recall last year, during the four quarters, we had LIFO charges in excess of $400 million pre-tax with a small amount that $14 million in the first quarter over $100 million in Q3 and over $200 million in Q4., 2% reward, sales penetration, LIFO charges, executive members, pre-tax charge, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, So, we\\'ll see what inflation does this year. Hopefully, it will continue to -- its current trends in the right direction. Other, the minus 17 and 18 basis points reported in ex-gas inflation. This is the $93 million charge, as mentioned in the earnings release, mostly related to downsizing our charter shipping activities., inflation, trends, $93 million charge, charter shipping, downsizing, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Over a year after COVID began, you will recall that the supply chain challenges related to shortages of the containers and shipping delays greatly intensified with container freight and shipping rate skyrocketing. It was in Q4 of 2021 on our earnings call that we mentioned our initial leasing of three ships and several thousand containers to help mitigate these challenges. Later, we added four additional vessels and additional needed containers with commitments made for up to three years. Our objectives at the time were twofold., supply chain, shortages, shipping delays, leasing ships, commitments, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, First, to increase the ability for more timely shipping and arrival of overseas merchandise. This allowed us to better stay in stock and drive sales; and second, to reduce some of the skyrocketing shipping and associated container costs. We achieved those objectives for a period of time. Over the course of a year, year and a half, we controlled the shipping and delivery of nearly 50,000 containers, many that would have been greatly delayed and at an estimated savings as compared to the then-current shipping container costs of somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000 per container., increase shipping speed, reduce shipping costs, controlled shipping, estimated savings, shipping\\ncontainer costs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, That, of course, fluctuated. Now, with a dramatic improvement in shipping times and much lower shipping and container costs, it made sense to downsize our commitment and lower prices for our members. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year over year by 35 basis points, coming in at a 920 compared to a year ago, 955., shipping times, shipping costs, SG&A, reported basis points, year over year comparison, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, And that plus 35 basis point improvement would be plus 13 basis point improvement, excluding gas inflation. Again, writing down six line items and two columns. First column being reported, second ex gas inflation. During the first quarter, our core operations was lower or better by eight basis points, plus eight then; without gas inflation, minus nine; central, zero and minus three; stock compensation, plus three and plus one; preopening, zero and zero; other, plus 24 and plus 24; for a total first-column reported -- year-over-year reported SG&A plus 35 or lower by 35 basis points and ex gas inflation, lower by 13., core operations, reported SG&A, ex-gas inflation, central, stock compensation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Now, going through those numbers, the core operations component of SG&A was, again, lower by eight basis points reported but higher by nine, excluding impact of gas inflation. These results include three sets of wage increases that were done in the past year-plus, as well as a little lower sales results in Q1 as compared to the prior quarter, still increases but a little lower than the prior quarter. Central was flat or zero and higher by three, ex gas inflation. Stock comp, again, a little lower number in stock comp as a percent, so it came down, improved a little bit., core operations, wage increases, sales results, central, stock compensation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Preopening, no impact. And the other, the 24 basis points you recall last year in Q1, this consisted of an asset write-off totaling $118 million pre-tax, which impacted the SG&A line last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $34 million this year, down $5 million or down from $39 million last year. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 11 year over year, $53 million versus $42 million a year ago., preopening, asset write-off, interest expense, interest income, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Interest income was higher year over year, offset by unfavorable FX. Overall, reported pre-tax income in the quarter was up 4%, coming in at $1.77 billion, compared to $1.696 billion a year ago. And excluding the charges described earlier in both years, pre-tax income was up around 3%. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q1 was 23% compared to 20.7% Q1 last year, so a little higher this year., interest income, unfavorable FX, reported pre-tax income, income taxes, tax rate, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Both years\\' tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier. The fiscal \\'23 effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items -- this discrete item, is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, we plan to open a net of 24 units this year, 27 openings, including three relocations, so net of 24., warehouse expansion, tax rate, stock-based compensation, effective tax rate, discrete items, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In the first quarter, the net of that 24 included seven. We plan three more in Q2, four in Q3, and 10 in Q4. In the first quarter, we opened, as I mentioned, seven net new warehouses. Four were in the U.S., and one each was in Korea, our first in New Zealand, and our first in Sweden., warehouse expansion, new warehouses, net new warehouses, Q2, Q3, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Additionally, last week, we opened another building in the U.S. And just yesterday, we opened our 14th location in Australia, our second on the country\\'s West Coast in or near Perth. In fiscal \\'23, again, 27 total new openings, including three locations for a net of 24. Of the net 24, it\\'s made up of 15 in the U.S., new\\nopenings, Australia, U.S., fiscal \\'23, net 24, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, and nine in Other International, including our third and fourth locations in China. Regarding capex, in the first quarter, capex was approximately $1.06 billion. And our estimate for the entire fiscal year is capex of somewhere in the $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion range. Moving to e-commerce., capex, China, e-commerce, international locations, fiscal year, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, E-commerce, as we mentioned in the press release, on a reported basis was -- for the quarter, year-over-year sales were minus 3.7 and minus two ex FX. Including sales -- what we don\\'t include in this number is our sales through like same-day delivery for fresh foods with our partners like Instacart, which we don\\'t include those, and they are fulfilled in our warehouse. Our e-comm comps, ex FX, would have been if we included it in the positive low single digits. Stronger departments in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were tickets and gift cards, tires, candy, and health and beauty aids., e-commerce, sales, fresh foods, comps, departments, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, The largest e-comm merchandise department majors, which includes consumer electronics and appliances, which represents over 40 -- close to 40% to 50% of our -- over 40% of our e-comm volume was down in the high single digits. Subsequent to quarter-end, we did have our two biggest e-comm selling days in our company history, both on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Now, a few comments regarding inflation. Recall, we\\'ve seen some minor improvements in a few areas., e-comm merchandise, department, volume, inflation, Black Friday, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Hopefully, continuing the comment I made last quarter\\'s earnings call, a little light at the end of the tunnel, but it\\'s still little. Recall last quarter in fourth quarter, we estimated that year-over-year price inflation was about 8%. In the first quarter, we estimate the equivalent year-over-year inflation number in the range of 6% to 7%. Food and sundries is still up more than nonfoods, but overall, a little better level than a quarter ago for the company., price inflation, year-over-year, first quarter, food and sundries, nonfoods, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, And commodity costs are mostly coming down, whether it\\'s corn flour, sugar, and butter or even some things like steel. A few things are up, but overall, we\\'re seeing a little bit of a trend, but we\\'ll keep you posted. Switching over to inventory levels. Recall that our total inventory in both -- at the end of Q3 and at the end of Q4 on a year-over-year basis were up 26% year over year., commodity costs, inventory levels, steel, Q3, Q4, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, I\\'m happy to report that good progress was made during the first quarter of this fiscal year. Our increase as of Q1 end dropped to a 10% year-over-year increase, largely driven by an estimated 6% to 7% inflation and about just under 2% year-over-year unit growth. So, inventories, while we still have some pockets of a little over inventory, overall, we feel pretty good about it. As a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, January 1, on Thursday, January 5, after the market closes., good progress, first quarter, inflation, unit growth, upcoming releases, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2023, 1, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back over to Bo.

Now, the 74 basis point year-over-year reduction is on a reported basis. Excluding gas inflation, it was minus 22 basis points. And as we normally do, we actually jot down a few numbers, and then we\\'ll elaborate a little bit more on margin., gross margin, reported basis, year-over-year reduction, excluding gas inflation, numbers, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, So the two columns would be reported year-over-year change, and the second one would be ex gas inflation, net year-over-year change. So the core merchandise margin on a reported basis, minus 67 basis points year-over-year, ex gas inflation, minus 23 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, the second line item, plus 20 and plus 34, our 2% reward, zero and minus five, LIFO, minus 27 and minus 28, and all told, total minus 74 reported, as I mentioned, and minus 22, excluding gas inflation basis. Starting with the core., reported year-over-year change, ex gas inflation, net year-over-year change, core merchandise\\nmargin, ancillary and other businesses, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Core merchandise\\'s contribution to gross margin was lower by 67 basis points year over year and by 23 ex gas inflation. The sales mix negatively impacted the core, primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our increasing and outsized gasoline sales. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in Q4, our core and core margins were lower by 26 basis points. That\\'s pretty much in line with each of the last three quarters when it ranged from minus 39 basis points year over year in Q3, minus 28 in Q2 and minus 18 in Q1 on a year-over-year basis., core merchandise, gross margin, sales mix, core margin, sales penetration, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, So again, for the quarter, it was minus 26 core-on-core. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 20 basis points and higher by 34 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gas, of course, as well as business centers and travel were better year over year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy, food court and optical, but overall, a positive year-over-year change. Our 2% reward, as I mentioned, on an ex gas inflation basis was higher or down five -- lower or down five basis points, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members., core-on-core, gross margin, businesses, gas, sales penetration, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of LIFO. LIFO, as you know, with inflation has been increasing. It was 27 basis points, down year over year -- or higher year over year. The LIFO charge this year on an ex gas inflation basis, 28 basis points higher, and that represented $223 million charge in the quarter., LIFO, inflation, year-over-year change, charge, basis points, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Recall that our LIFO charges were relatively small in the first part of the year at $14 million, last quarter, in the third quarter, $130 million, and then as I mentioned here, $223 million for the quarter. Moving to SG&A. We showed good results. Reported SG&A came in at 8.53% compared to last year\\'s 9.22% or an improvement of 69 basis points., LIFO charges, SG&A, basis points, charge, quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, But again, ex gas inflation, the improvement was still good at 26 basis points lower year over year. Again, charting down a few numbers here, charting down the numbers on a core operations basis, on a reported basis, that was plus 50 basis points or positive reduction of 50 improvement, ex gas inflation, plus 12 basis points. Central, plus two and minus three. Stock compensation, plus two and plus one., core operations, reported basis, ex gas inflation, central, stock compensation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Preopening expense, plus one and plus two. Other, plus 14 and plus 14. That gets you down to again on a reported basis, year-over-year SG&A was improved by 59 basis points, and ex gas inflation by 26 basis points. In terms of the quarter year over year, the core operations was, again, better by 12, excluding the impact of gas inflation., preopening expense, other, SG&A, quarter, core operations, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Keep in mind, these results include the starting wage increases we instituted in October of 2021, so in the first quarter of this fiscal year, this past fiscal year, as well as new wage and benefits increases implemented during the third quarter in March of this year, as well as the impact of eight weeks in this quarter as we increase the top-of-scale increase that went into effect July 4. So a few increases that we\\'ve done this year. And still, we feel pretty good SG&A improvement given our sales strength. Central was lower by two basis points and higher by three ex gas inflation., wage increases, sales strength, SG&A improvement, basis points, quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Nothing big to talk about there. Again, stock compensation I mentioned. Preopening, I\\'ve just -- we\\'ve noted that since we now include preopening on the income statement as part of SG&A instead of a separate line item. And other, again, the 14 basis points, recall that that included that last year\\'s write-off in the quarter totaling $84 million., stock compensation, preopening, other, basis points, quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased 10%, coming in at $2.497 billion. A little of that benefit was that asset write-off last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $48 million this year versus $52 million last year, relatively similar. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $1 million year over year, coming in at $67 million this year versus $68 million last year., operating income, asset write-off, interest expense, interest income, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Interest income was actually higher, but that was offset by unfavorable FX impact, which pretty much offset each other to be roughly flat year over year. Overall, reported pre-tax income was up 10%, coming in at $2.516 billion this year, up from $2.291 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.4% compared to 26.1% in Q4 last year. The fiscal \\'23 effective tax rate, we estimate, is currently projected to be approximately 26%., income taxes, pre-tax income, fiscal \\'23 effective tax rate, unfavorable FX impact, quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Net -- one thing I mentioned why we haven\\'t mentioned in the past, net income attributable to Costco, that line item was up 12%. Recall that on June 30 this past year, we acquired the 45% minority interest from our JV partner in Taiwan. So we now own all of Costco Taiwan. As a result, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was better by $14 million in the quarter., net income, Costco Taiwan, minority interest, quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, The noncontrolling interest line will become zero going forward, essentially, a small amount, but pretty much zero. A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion. In the fourth quarter, we opened nine net new warehouses. So for the full year, we opened 26 warehouses, but that included three relocations, so a net increase during the year of 23 locations., noncontrolling interest, warehouse expansion, full year, locations, quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In the fourth quarter -- of the nine we opened, five were in the U.S., two were in Canada and one each in Korea and Japan. In fiscal \\'23, we expect to open 29 new warehouses, including four relos, so for a net of 25 new warehouses. These 25 planned net new openings are made up of 15 in the U.S. and 10 in Other International, including our first locations in each of New Zealand and Sweden, and our third and fourth locations in China., warehouse openings, U.S., Canada, Korea, Japan, Other International, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter Q4 spending capex was approximately $1.26 billion. And for the full year, capex expenditures was $3.9 billion. Our estimate for the coming year fiscal \\'23 capex to be approximately the same, in the $3.8 billion to $4 billion range. In terms of e-commerce business, e-com sales in the fourth quarter, ex FX, increased 8.4%., capex, spending, full year, e-commerce, sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Stronger departments in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were tires, lawn, patio and garden, prescription pharmacy and health and beauty aids. The largest e-com merchandise department in dollars, what we call majors, which includes everything from computers to appliances to TVs to audio, etc., was up in the high single digits. And CostcoGrocery, including our third-party delivery, two-day, dry, fresh and frozen, continue to grow. They were up 20% in the quarter., tires, lawn, patio and garden, e-com merchandise, CostcoGrocery, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, An update on Costco Logistics. With Costco Logistics, we continue to transition from vendor drop ship to direct ship from our own inventory, particularly in big and bulky items. Overall, this lowers the cost of the merchandise and improve delivery times on service levels to our members, and I\\'ll share with you some statistics to that in a minute. Prior to this acquisition, in the U.S., we were completing a few years ago about 2 million big and bulky deliveries and installations per year., Costco Logistics, direct ship, merchandise, delivery times, statistics, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In fiscal \\'22, we completed 4.3 million big and bulky deliveries and installation. Previously, all of those 2 million deliveries and installations were made by third parties. In fiscal \\'22, about 70% or a little over 3 million of the 4.3 million were done by us. In the fourth quarter, in fact, that percentage of deliveries and installations done by -- performed by us was 81%., fiscal \\'22, big and bulky deliveries, installation, fourth quarter, percentage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Pre-acquisition, the estimated average days to deliver was above 15 days, and we were working with over 100 delivery partners. Today, our average delivery time for big and bulky is just under five days, and we\\'re continuing to work to improve that. And we were down to eight delivery -- primary delivery partners. A few comments regarding inflation., pre-acquisition, delivery time, delivery partners, inflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'ve seen minor improvement in a few areas. But all in, pressures from higher commodity prices, higher wages and higher transportation costs and supply chain disruptions. They\\'re still present, but we are seeing just a little light at the end of the tunnel. And if you recall in the third quarter, we indicated that price inflation overall was about 7% plus for us., minor improvement, commodity prices, wages, transportation costs, supply chain disruptions, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, For the fourth quarter and talking with our merchants, the estimated price inflation overall was about 8%, a little higher on the food and sundries side, a little lower on fresh foods, and both higher and lower on the nonfood side. We\\'re seeing commodities -- some commodities prices coming down, such as gas, steel, beef, relative to a year ago, even some small cost changes in plastics. We\\'re seeing some relief on container pricing. Wages are still the higher thing when we talk to our suppliers., price inflation, fourth quarter, merchants, commodity prices, wages, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, And as we all know, wages still seem to be the one thing that\\'s still relatively higher. But overall, some beginnings of some light at the end of that tunnel. And of course, that could change each week. In all, despite current inflation levels, we believe we continue to remain competitive versus others and able to raise prices as cost increases., wages, light at the end of the tunnel, inflation levels, competitiveness, price raises, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Hopefully, of course, a little less than others with who we compete. Many of you have asked about private label with the recent inflationary environment and what\\'s happening, are people trading down. And of course, our first response, of course, is they\\'re not trading down. They\\'re trading up or certainly trading the same., private label, inflationary environment, trading down, trading up, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of Kirkland Signature merchandise penetration and excluding gas and other businesses that carry the Kirkland name. Kirkland Signature merchandise is up just under 1% in terms of penetration compared to a year ago. Our KS merchandise penetration is about 28% for the year. This is similar to historical trends where it\\'s increasing slowly and steadily over time., Kirkland Signature merchandise, penetration, excluding gas, historical\\ntrends, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, So no big dramatic change from the past there. In terms of supply chain. Generally, supply chain has improved a little, including on-time deliveries. We started seeing container prices coming down., supply chain, on-time deliveries, container prices, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, The first place you see it, of course, is in the spot market. And then, you\\'ll start to see it hopefully in some other contracts as they continue. No longer any big capacity issues or container shortages. Domestically, port delays have improved., spot market, contracts, capacity issues, container shortages, port delays, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, And while the rail strike that was in the news a few weeks ago was thankfully averted, in anticipation of strike, there were some rail ramp closures and delays in restarting that. But the view from our buyers is that this should be eliminated for the most part toward the end of this week. Switching over to inventory levels. Our total inventory at Q4 end was up year over year, was up just under 26% year over year., rail strike, rail ramp closures, inventory levels, total inventory, year over year, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, At the end of the third quarter, it was up just over 26%. Of the 26% increase, an estimated 10 to 11 percentage points of it is inflation. That\\'s that 8% number. And new warehouse growth, that\\'s that 3% number in terms of unit growth over the last year, but still up year over year., inflation, new warehouse growth, unit growth, third quarter, year over year, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Additionally, we\\'re lapping some low stocks in certain departments as a result of last year\\'s high demand, specifically in nonfood areas where last year, we were about 90% of our target at inventory levels. Food and sundries and fresh are in good shape, we feel. Our weak supply is comparable year over year. In terms of nonfood inventories., inventory levels, nonfood areas, food and sundries, fresh, weak supply, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, It\\'s up in certain categories. Again, this is in part a result of being light in certain departments last year, as mentioned earlier. The good news so far, initial seasonal sales seem to be going well, as evidenced in our monthly sales reports. And all told, we would expect the 26% year-over-year increase to start to head down as it has in just the past few weeks a little bit., seasonal sales, monthly sales reports, year-over-year increase, inventory levels, department sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Lastly, as a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, October 2, this next week on Wednesday -- in two weeks, on Wednesday, October 5, after the market close -- closes.

He is doing great and wishes he could be on the call. He is in Italy with his family on a rescheduled vacation that was canceled early in the pandemic. He wanted me to pass along his best to everyone., Richard, Italy, family vacation, pandemic, best wishes, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, And in his absence, I will be filling in for him today.

OK., risks and uncertainties, actual events, performance differences, SEC filings, forward-looking\\nstatements, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, With that out of the way, let\\'s get to it. In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal \\'22, the 12 weeks ended this past May 8. Net income for the quarter was $1.353 billion, $3.04 per diluted share. The reported $3.04 included a one-time $77 million pre-tax charge, $0.13 per diluted share, for incremental benefits awarded under the new employee agreement effective this past March 14., operating results, third quarter of fiscal \\'22, net income, pre-tax charge, employee agreement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Last year\\'s third quarter net income was $1.22 billion, $2.75 per diluted share, which included $57 million pre-tax or $0.09 per diluted share for costs incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages. In terms of this year\\'s $77 million pre-tax charge, this was in conjunction with our new employee agreement, again, effective this past March 14, and was primarily to adjust our benefit accrual to account for one additional day of vacation which is awarded to each employee immediately. The continuing impacts of the wage and benefit enhancements are reflected in SG&A and margin for this quarter and will be as well for subsequent quarters. Net income for the first 36 weeks of fiscal \\'22 was $3.98 billion, $8.94 per diluted share, and that compares to $3.34 billion or $7.51 per diluted share last year., net income, third quarter, employee agreement, benefit accrual, SG&A and margin, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Let\\'s now review the metrics of our P&L, as always, starting with sales. Net sales for the third quarter increased 16.3% to $51.61 billion, and that compares to $44.38 billion reported last year in Q3. In terms of comparable sales for the third quarter, for the 12 weeks on a reported basis, the U.S. was better or up by 16.6%; Canada, better by 15.2%; Other International, up 5.7%; and total company, again, up 14.9%., sales, net sales, comparable sales, U.S., Canada, Other International, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Our e-com business in the third quarter reported better by 7.4% versus a year ago. For the 12 weeks, excluding the benefit of gas inflation and the headwinds of FX, the U.S. came in at up 10.7%; Canada better by 12.8%; Other International up $9.1 million; and on a total company basis, ex gas inflation and FX headwinds, better by 10.8%; and e-commerce just below 8% at 7.9% for the quarter. In terms of Q3 comp metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and up 5.6% in the U.S., e-commerce, third quarter, sales growth, traffic, comp metrics, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Our average transaction was up 7.6% worldwide and up 10.4% in the U.S. during the quarter. And foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by just a little over 1%., transaction, worldwide, U.S., foreign currencies, sales impact, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, And our gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales in the quarter just a little bit more than 5%. The best-performing categories in Q3 were candy, sundries, tires, toys, jewelry, kiosks, home furnishings, apparel, bakery, and deli. Underperforming departments were liquor, office, sporting goods, and hardware, all of which were quite strong a year ago. In terms of other business sales, the best performers came in from gasoline, travel, food course, and our business centers., sales growth, e-commerce, transaction size, foreign currencies, best-performing categories, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, So overall, our sales grew nicely in the quarter and, for the most part, were pretty broad-based. Moving down the income statement. Membership fee income reported in Q3 $984 million or 1.91 as a percentage of sales, compared to last year\\'s $901 million or 2.03 as a percentage of sales. That\\'s up $83 million year over year or a 9.2% increase., sales growth, income statement, membership fee income, percentage of sales, year-over-year\\nincrease, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, And excluding headwinds from FX of about $10.6 million, membership was up 10.4% in the quarter. In terms of renewal rates, we hit all-time highs.

Renewal rates continue to benefit from the increased penetration of both auto renewals and more executive members and, in addition to that, higher first-year member renewal rates than what we have historically seen. In terms of member counts, number of member households, and cardholders at Q3 end, we ended Q3 with 64.4 million paid households and 116.6 million cardholders, both of those up over 6% compared to a year ago. At Q3 end, our paid executive memberships were 27.9 million, and that\\'s an increase of just about 800,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end., renewal rates, member counts, member households, cardholders, executive memberships, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Executive members now represent over 43% of our member base and over 71% of our worldwide sales. Now before I move on, I want to take just a minute and address the question that we\\'ve been getting a lot recently regarding the timing of the potential membership fee increase. Historically, we\\'ve raised fees every five to six years, with the last three increases coming, on average, at about the five-and-a-half-year time frame and our last increase coming in June of 2017. As we approach this five-and-a-half-year mark, there will be more discussions with Craig, Ron, and the executive team., executive members, member base, sales, membership fee increase, timing, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, But for today, we have nothing more specific to report in terms of timing. In addition, given the current macro environment, the historically high inflation, and the burden it\\'s having on our members and all consumers in general, we think increasing our membership fee today ahead of our typical timing is not the right time. We will let you know, however, when that changes. OK., timing, macro environment, inflation, membership fee increase, consumer impact, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Moving on along the P&L, let\\'s take a look at gross margins. Our reported gross margins in the third quarter were lower year over year by 99 basis points, this year coming in at 10.19 as a percentage of sales, and that compares to last year\\'s 11.18 that we reported a year ago. So the 99 basis points, down year over year and, excluding the negative impacts of gas inflation, we would have been down 53 basis points. So if you would for me, and as normal, please jot down the following for our gross margin matrix and again, as usual, two columns: the first column being reported gross margin, the second column being gross margin without the impact of gas inflation., gross margins, percentage of sales, year-over-year decrease, gas inflation, gross margin matrix, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, There are six rows: the first row being merchandise core; second, ancillary and other business; the third row, 2% rewards; followed by LIFO; other; and then total. So in terms of our core merchandise margins on a reported basis, they were down 87 basis points versus last year, down 46 basis points, ex gas; ancillary and other, plus 6 reported and plus 18, ex gas; 2% rewards, plus 8 and plus 3; LIFO, minus 25 basis points on a reported basis and minus 27, ex gas inflation; and finally, other, minus 1, with and without gas; so again, in total, down 99 reported; down 53, excluding the impact of gas inflation. A little color, more color, on gross margins, starting with core merchandise. The core merchandise contribution to gross margin was lower by 46 basis points, ex gas inflation, in the quarter., merchandise margins, core merchandise, ancillary and other business, 2% rewards, LIFO, total, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Sales mix negatively impacted the core primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our gasoline sales, which were very strong in the quarter. In terms of the core margins on their own sales in Q3, our core-on-core margins were lower by 39 basis points, approximately two-thirds of this coming from fresh foods. Fresh experienced a very difficult compare versus last year when the extraordinary volumes produced lower D&D and higher labor productivity a year ago. Also contributing to the fresh decline this quarter were higher raw material costs and higher labor costs due to our new wages., sales mix, core sales, gasoline sales, core margins, fresh foods, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Ancillary and other business gross margin, again, higher by 6 reported, higher by 18 basis points, ex gas inflation. Gas, travel, and business centers were better year over year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy, and optical; again, 2% rewards, higher by 8 reported, higher by 3, ex gas; LIFO, minus 25 and minus 27, ex gas, as we recorded $130 million charge in the quarter for LIFO; and other was minus 1 basis point, both with and ex gas inflation.

The net result of these two items, again, minus 1 basis point. And while we continue to mitigate the impact of price increases as best as we can, we remain comfortable in our ability to pass through higher costs while providing great value to our members. Moving to SG&A., gross margin charge, price increases, SG&A, value to members, cost mitigation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, We showed good results. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year over year by 84 basis points, coming in at 8.62%, and that compares to last year\\'s reported 9.46% SG&A figure. That\\'s, again, 84 basis points lower or better and 44 basis points, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Again, if you jot down the following for our SG&A matrix, again, two columns, the first column being reported SG&A the second column, SG&A ex the impacts of gas inflation., SG&A, reported SG&A, year-over-year decrease, gas inflation, SG&A matrix, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, And we have five rows: the first row operations: second row, central; third row, stock compensation expense; fourth row, other; and then total is the fifth row.

Central was better by 15 and better by 10 without gas; stock comp plus 2, plus 1 without gas; and again, other, minus 1 basis point; minus 2 without gas inflation.

Last year, we had $44 million of COVID expenses., wage\\nincrease, new wage and benefit increases, central, stock compensation, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, And this year, we had a one-time charge, again, discussed at the beginning of the call, $57 million of the $77 million, which related to SG&A. The net result of these two items, again, minus 1 reported; minus 2, ex gas inflation. So all told, reported operating income in Q3 of this year increased 8%, coming in at $1.791 billion.

The 24 new warehouses by market are 14 in the U.S., two in Canada, and one each in Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Spain, France, China, and our first opening in New Zealand, which will occur in August of this year. In terms of the new openings this year, this is four fewer than what we projected in Q2.

Regarding capex, the Q3 F \\'22 spend was approximately $854 million. Our full year capex spend is estimated for the year to be just shy of about $4 billion.

Stronger departments in the quarter were special order, patio and garden, jewelry, and home furnishings. Our largest e-com merchandise department, majors, which includes consumer electronics, appliances, and TVs, was up a little bit better than mid-single digits on a very strong sales increase a year earlier.

For the full year, we estimate total deliveries will be up 23% and will exceed 3 million., Costco Logistics, sales, stops, deliveries, full year, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, With logistics, we continue to transition from vendor drop ship to direct ship from our own inventory, particularly in big and bulky items. Overall, this lowers the cost of merchandise and improves delivery times and service levels for our members. OK. Now a few comments regarding inflation., logistics, transition, direct ship, merchandise cost, delivery times, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, First of all, it continues. Pressures from higher commodity prices, higher wages, higher transportation costs, and supply chain disruptions all still in play. For Q1, we estimated price inflation was in the 4.5% to 5% range. For Q2, we had estimated 6-ish, if you will., inflation, commodity prices, wages, transportation costs, supply chain disruptions, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, And for Q3, in talking to our merchants, estimated price inflation was in the 7-ish percent range. However, we did see inflation in fresh foods come in slightly lower in Q3 versus Q2 a year ago as we began cycling high meat prices. We believe our solid sales increases and relatively consistent margins show that we have continued to strike the right balance in passing on higher costs. Switching over to inventory for a minute., Inflation, Sales, Margins, Inventory, Pricing, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Our total inventory in Q3 was up 26% year over year versus up 19% in Q2. A couple of high-level comments regarding inventory. A material component of the increase year over year is inflation rather than unit growth. We continue to expand and opened new locations, 20 new in the last 12 months., Inventory, Growth, Inflation, Locations, Expansion, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, We are lapping some low stocks in certain departments as a result of last year\\'s high demand. And we are purposely building inventory in our e-com business, primarily in big and bulky categories, as mentioned earlier in the call. Food and sundries and fresh is in very good shape. Our weak supply is comparable year over year., Inventory, E-commerce, Food, Supply, Demand, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Nonfood inventories are up in certain categories. This is in part a result of being light in certain departments last year, specifically, seasonal, lawn and garden, TVs, appliances, and sporting goods. Otherwise, we are a little heavy in small appliances and domestics, primarily due to late-arriving merchandise this year. In addition, we have a few hundred million dollars of extra inventory in both late-arriving holiday merchandise from last season, which we\\'re storing until this fall, and some buy-in merchandise to ensure proper inventory levels in the face of these ongoing supply chain issues., Inventory, Categories, Supply Chain, Merchandise, Storage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, Speaking with Craig; Ron; and Claudine Adamo, our new head of merchandising, we feel good about our current inventory levels. The additional inventory we\\'re carrying is in the right departments, and they feel good about our ability to move it. A quick update on China. Our first opening in China located in Minhang, Shanghai was closed for the last six weeks of the third quarter., Inventory, Merchandising, China, Departments, Movement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, That closure had a negative impact in the quarter of approximately $35 million in sales. As of May 18, we\\'re happy to report that the building is back open but operating under restrictions on the number of people that can be in the building at one time, among other, cleaning and operating restrictions.

We\\'re currently targeting an opening date of this December for our third Shanghai building in Pudong., Closure, Sales, Building, Restrictions, Opening, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 3, Bob Nelson, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, The timing although will somewhat depend on the area remaining open for the next several months and not being more negatively impacted by lockdowns. Four additional China buildings are currently underway and planned with opening dates in the next two years. These would be our first China openings outside of Shanghai.

Let me just say the price, when we introduced the hot dog-soda combo in the mid-\\'80s, was $1.50. The price today is $1.50, and we have no plans to increase the price at this time. With that, I will turn it back over to Erica and open it up for Q&A., Price, Combination, Food Courts, Media, Q&A, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Jerome, and good afternoon to everyone.

In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal \\'22, the 12 weeks ended this past February 13, as well as February retail results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 27.

I will review our February sales results later in the call., Foreign Currencies, Gasoline Price Inflation, Sales Impact, February Sales\\nResults, Review, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Going down our second quarter fiscal 2022 income statement. Membership fee income reported came in at $967 million, up $86 million or up 9.8% from a year earlier, $881 million. There was about a $6.5 million impact -- negative impact due to FX.

Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was lower year over year by 32 basis points but up 5 basis points, excluding gas inflation. As I always do, I\\'ll ask you to jot down a few numbers, two columns. The first column is reported, and the second column would be excluding gas inflation., Gross Margin, Reported Gross Margin, Ex-Gas Inflation, Gas Inflation Impact,\\nSecond Quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, First line item, merchandise -- core merchandise on a reported basis was down 75% -- 75 basis points year over year, and ex gas inflation, down 43. Ancillary and other businesses, reported, plus 40 basis points, and ex gas inflation, plus 49 basis points. 2% Reward, plus 3 and minus 1 basis points.

So totally, on a reported basis, again year over year, minus 32 basis points, and excluding gas inflation, plus 5 basis points. Now in terms of the core merchandise component being lower by 75 year over year reported and 43 -- minus 43 basis points ex gas inflation, recall last year in Q2 that the core reported was plus 71 basis points and ex gas, plus 63, so still improved to where we were two years ago, pre-pandemic and ex gas. In terms of the core margin on its own sales, in Q2, our core-on-core margin, if you will, was lower by 28 basis points year over year, approximately two-thirds of this coming from fresh foods and a little from foods and sundries and nonfoods as well., Other, Core Merchandise, Gas Inflation Impact, Core Margin, Fresh Foods, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Fresh continues to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales a year ago in the second quarter. Ancillary and other business gross margin was higher by 40 basis points and by 49 ex gas in the quarter. Gas, travel, business centers, and pharmacy were all better year over year, offset by e-comm and optical. LIFO, we had a 14-basis-point hit year over year to LIFO, or $71 million LIFO charge during the quarter, both with and without gas inflation., Fresh, Labor Productivity, Ancillary and Other Businesses, Gas Inflation Impact,\\nLIFO, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Recall that our Q1 LIFO charge year over year was $14 million -- or in the first quarter was $14 million or a 3-basis-point delta versus the prior year. It\\'s been the last three fiscal quarters that we\\'ve actually pointed out LIFO as we saw a little bit of inflation going back to December or Q4 of fiscal \\'21, a little more in Q1 of this fiscal year, and, as with everything you read in the news, a little -- quite a bit more in Q2. Our 2% Reward was higher on a reported basis by three and minus one excluding gas inflation, a reflection of increased penetration of the 2% Reward Executive Members. And other was plus 14 basis points year over year., LIFO, 2% Reward, Gas Inflation Impact, Other, Penetration, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, This is related to the COVID-related costs from a year ago, about $60 million. That\\'s the portion of COVID-related wages that go into cost of sales that -- like related to manufacturing businesses, as well as their meat and bakery departments. Overall, a pretty good showing on gross margin given the ongoing and increasing inflationary pressures. Moving to expenses, to SG&A., COVID-Related Costs, Gross Margin, Inflationary Pressures, Expenses, SG&A, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was lower or better year over year by 94 basis points and better by 63 basis points excluding gas inflation. Again, jotting down two columns of numbers, reported and the second one, ex gas inflation. Operations, plus 36 basis points and plus 9. Here, a plus is good., SG&A, Gas Inflation Impact, Operations, Reported vs Excluding Gas Inflation,\\nNumbers, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, It means it\\'s lower year over year. Central, plus 13 and plus 10. Stock compensation, plus three and plus two.

Now again, looking at the first line item, operations, the core operations component, better again by 36 but as well better by 9 or lower by 9 basis points excluding the impact from gas inflation. Keep in mind that this improvement occurred despite both the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that began in March of 2021 is now anniversary-ing and the additional starting wage increases from our two-basic hourly scale, service assistant, and service clerk, by an additional $0.50 an hour. That occurred in October of 2021., Operations, Gas Inflation Impact, Wage Increases, Numbers, Improvement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, On central, better by 13 basis points or 10 ex gas inflation. It\\'s pretty straightforward, operating leverage on strong sales figures. Stock comp, plus two and plus two, again a reflection of good sales.

In terms of preopening expenses. In past conference calls, really since we went public, I think, we\\'ve covered that preopening expenses next on this discussion. Starting this fiscal year, going forward, preopening is now included in SG&A., Preopening Expenses, Inclusion in SG&A, Year-Over-Year Improvement, Numbers,\\nConference Calls, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, The year-over-year change in SG&A related to preopening was flat year over year, no basis point delta year over year in the second quarter. All told, reported operating income in Q2 increased 35% on a reported basis, coming in at $1.812 billion this year compared to $1.340 billion a year ago in the second quarter. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $36 million this year versus $40 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million year over year, $25 million this year versus $19 million last year primarily due to favorable FX., Year-Over-Year Change in SG&A, Preopening Expenses, Operating Income, Interest\\nExpense, Favorable FX, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Overall, reported pre-tax income in the quarter was up 37%, coming in at $1.801 billion compared to $1.319 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q2 was slightly higher than it was in Q2 a year ago. It came in at 26.7% compared to 26.4% a year ago in the second quarter. Our effective tax rate is currently -- it continues to be projected to be in the 26% to 27% range for the fiscal year., Pre-Tax Income, Income Tax Rate, Effective Tax Rate, Year-Over-Year Comparison,\\nFiscal Year Projections, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, A few other items of note. Warehouse expansion, for the year, we now plan to have 32 new units and -- 32 units, including four relocations, so replacing existing units to larger and better-located facilities, so net total of 28. I think a quarter ago, we actually said it was a net total of 27, so one more than that. However, remember, several of these are slotted to open in Q4, our fiscal Q4, 15 of them or 14 net new., Warehouse Expansion, New Units, Relocations, Fiscal Q4, Net New, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, So there\\'s always a potential for one of those to shift into the next fiscal year. The five openings in Q2 that we had, one each in Mexico, our 40th in Mexico, our second in France, our second in China, our fourth in Spain and one additional unit in Florida, where we now have 29 locations. Regarding capital expenditures, our Q2 spend for capex was approximately $723 million, and our full year capex spend is still estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion. Moving on to e-commerce., Fiscal Year Shift, Capital Expenditures, E-Commerce, New Locations, Full Year\\nCapex Spend, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, E-commerce sales in Q2 ex FX, as I mentioned earlier, increased 12.6% year over year. And that\\'s, of course, on top of a second quarter fiscal \\'21 increase of 75% increase last year, benefiting, of course, from COVID. Stronger departments in e-commerce in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were jewelry, tires, special or kiosk items, patio and garden, and home furnishings.

Deliveries were up year over year, 22%. And now about 85% of our U.S. e-comm less-than-truckload shipments are from Costco Logistics., Costco Logistics, Delivery Increase, U.S. E-comm Shipments, Year-Over-Year\\nIncrease, Percentage of Shipments, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re doing ourselves. Average during the quarter, we averaged more than 65,000 stops per week with Costco Logistics, which translates into a little over $3 million planned drops in Costco Logistics for the fiscal year.

In terms of our e-commerce platform, Costco Next, we added a few additional suppliers. So we now have 37 suppliers online and growing.

One of the things that we\\'ve done that I mentioned last quarter, I mentioned we had chartered three small container vessels to help provide us with additional flexibility on shipping. We have now charged a total of seven ocean vessels, up from those three, for the next three years., Chip Shortages, Shelves Full, Sales Driving, Ocean Vessels, Chartering, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, And these would transport containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada. We\\'ve also leased containers for use in these ships. With these additions, about a quarter of our annual transpacific containers and shipment needs are being accommodated this way, which gives us additional supply chain flexibility., Container Transport, Leasing Containers, Supply Chain Flexibility, Annual Needs, Shipment\\nNeeds, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Despite all the supply chain issues, we\\'re staying in stock and continue to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. From -- every day and every week, you\\'re going to see in -- different items in different departments, certain things on allocation or short, but other things are filling its place. And again, some things are seeming to get a little better. Moving to inflation., Supply Chain Issues, Stock Availability, Cost and Price Increases, Allocation,\\nImprovement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Inflation, of course, continues, as evidenced by our LIFO charge. The inflationary pressures that we and others continue to see include higher labor costs, higher freight costs, as well as higher transportation demand, along with the container shortages and port delays that I just mentioned, increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils and chemicals to resins, higher commodity prices from foodservice oils to additives and motor oils, to plastics, to detergents, to paper products as well, on the fresh side proteins and butter and eggs and things like that, not very different than what you hear and read and see from others. But again, we think we\\'ve done a pretty good job of corralling it as best we can. For first quarter, a year -- a quarter ago, I mentioned that we estimated, at that time, overall price inflation to have been in the 4.5% to 5% range., Inflation, LIFO Charge, Labor Costs, Freight Costs, Commodity Prices, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, For the second quarter and talking with senior merchants, estimated overall price inflation was in the 6% range. All of these said, again, I want to give another shout-out to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and operators have all been able to do to keep -- in order to keep the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary, keep our warehouses full, like keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continue to show great value versus our competitors. Now turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 27, compared to the same four-week period a year ago. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $16.29 billion, an increase of 15.9% from $14.05 billion a year earlier., Second Quarter Estimates, Price Inflation, Product Availability, Sales Results,\\nCompetition, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Recall from January sales results that Lunar New Year/Chinese New Year occurred on February 1. That\\'s 11 days earlier this past -- this year than last. This shift negatively impacted February\\'s other international by about 4 percentage points and total company by about 0.5 percentage point.

Our comp traffic and frequency for February was up 8% worldwide and 8.2% in the United States. Foreign currencies year over year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comp sales as follows: Canada by approximately 0.2%, Other International by approximately 4.5%, and total company by approximately 0.7%.

Food and sundries was -- came in at a positive high single digits, fresh foods in the mid-single digits, and nonfoods in the positive high single digits. Ancillary businesses sales were up mid-40s, with gas being certainly a driver of that, as well as food court and hearing aids were the top performers. With that, I want to mention just a couple of recent executive changes., Merchandise Highlights, Food and Sundries, Fresh Foods, Nonfoods, Ancillary\\nBusinesses Sales, Executive Changes, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, A month ago, we reported that Ron Vachris became president of Costco. Ron started his career 39 years ago at Price Company, at Price Club at the young age of 17. Most of his career was in operations through 2015. Then he spent a little over a year in real estate, traveling the world and working on both worldwide and domestic expansion, and since that time in 2016 has been in merchandising with certainly responsibility not only for in-line merchandising but online merchandising, as well as very involved with logistics and transportation., Ron Vachris, Career, Operations, Merchandising, Logistics and Transportation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 2, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, As well, just this week, internally, we reported that taking Ron\\'s previous spot as head of merchandising is Claudine Adamo. Claudine has been with us for 30 years. She began in an hourly position in our Kirkland warehouse in 1992, 30 years ago but a year later came into buying and has been in buying ever since and most recently was senior VP of nonfoods sales -- of nonfoods merchandising.

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.

In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal \\'22, the 12 weeks ended November 21. Net income for the quarter came in at $1.324 billion or $2.98 per diluted share compared to $1.166 billion or $2.62 per diluted share last year. This year included a tax benefit of $91 million or $0.21 a share related to stock-based compensation and a write-off of certain IT assets of $118 million pre-tax or $0.20 per share., Forward-Looking Statements, Operating Results, Net Income, Tax Benefit, IT Assets, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Last year included tax benefits of $145 million or $0.33 per diluted share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend received by the company\\'s 401(k) plan participants and $0.17 related to stock-based compensation, as well an incremental expenses for COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pre-tax, which was hit last year in the quarter of $0.35 per share. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.7% to $49.42 billion, up from $42.35 billion a year earlier in the first quarter. Same-store sales for the first quarter were as follows. In the U.S., on a reported basis for the 12 weeks, up 14.9%; and excluding gas inflation and the impacts of FX, up 9.9%., Tax Benefits, COVID-19 Premium Wages, Net Sales, Same-Store Sales, Dividend, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Canada reported 17.2%; ex gas and FX, plus 8.3%. Other International, reported, 13.4%; ex gas inflation and FX, up 10.9%. All told, the company reported a 15% increase on a comp basis and 9.8% up ex gas and FX. In e-commerce, which was reported at 14.3%, ex FX, was 13.3%., Canada, Other International, Comp Sales, E-Commerce, Gas Inflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and up 5.9% in the U.S. during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.7% worldwide and 8.5% in the U.S. during the quarter., Traffic, Shopping Frequency, Average Transaction, Ticket Size, Comp Sales Metrics, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Excluding the positive impact from gas inflation and FX, the average ticket was up ex that plus 2.5% worldwide and plus 3.5% in the U.S. foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by about 90 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 430 basis points., Average Ticket, Gas Inflation, Foreign Currencies, Sales Growth, Comp Sales Metrics, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement, membership fee income reported in the quarter, $946 million, up $85 million or 9.9% from last year\\'s $861 million figure. Ex FX, the $85 million increase would have been $80 million and the 9.9% increase would be 9.3%. In terms of renewal rates, at first quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate came in at 91.6%, up 0.3% from the 12-week earlier figure at Q4 end., Membership Fee Income, Renewal Rates, Comp Sales Metrics, Foreign Currencies, Income\\nStatement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As well, the worldwide rate came in at 89%, also up 0.3% from 12 weeks ago at Q4 quarter end -- at Q4 end. The renewal rates are continuing to benefit from more members auto renewing, as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than the nonexecutive members and first year renewal rates, which have improved a little. In terms of number of members at end of first quarter -- in terms of member households, as well as total cardholders, at Q1 end, total paid households was 62.5 million, up 800,000 from 61.7 million a quarter ago. And total cardholders 113.1 million, up 1.5 million from the 111.6 million 12 weeks ago., Renewal Rates, Member Households, Total Cardholders, Member Auto Renew, First Year\\nRenewal Rates, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, At Q1 end, paid executive members totaled 26.5 million, an increase of 836,000 during the 12 weeks since Q4 end. Executive members represent 42% of our members and a little over 70% of our sales. Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin for the first quarter was lower year over year by 49 basis points, and excluding gas inflation, lower year over year by 6 basis points., Executive Members, Sales Growth, Gross Margin, Gas Inflation, Comp Sales Metrics, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As I normally do, I ask you a jot down a few numbers. The two columns, both reported year over year in Q1 and then without gas inflation year over year in Q1. First line item would be core merchandise, minus 63 basis points year over year on a reported basis and minus 26 basis points without gas inflation. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 2 on a reported basis and plus 12 ex gas inflation; 2% Reward, plus 3 and minus 1 basis point; LIFO, minus 3 in both columns; other, plus 12 basis points in both columns., Core Merchandise, Ancillary and Other Businesses, 2% Reward, LIFO, Other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Total then on a reported basis, margins were down 49 basis points year over year; and ex gas inflation, down 6 basis points. In terms of the core merchandise component of gross margin being lower by 63% year over year and 26 basis points ex gas inflation. Recall last year in Q1, the core reported was up 83 basis points; and ex gas, up 66 basis points. So we retained a good portion of the improvement from two years ago in the quarter., Total Margins, Core Merchandise Gross Margin, Gas Inflation Impact, Comp Sales Metrics,\\nRetained Improvement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the first quarter, our core-on-core margins were lower by 18 basis points, with non-foods slightly up and food and sundries slightly lower year over year. Also lower year over year, fresh foods was the primary driver of the core-on-core being lower in the quarter. Fresh continues to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales that began the year -- that happened a year ago in the quarter. Ancillary and other business gross margin was higher by 2 basis points on a reported basis and, again, plus 12 basis points ex gas inflation., Core Margin, Non-Foods, Food and Sundries, Fresh Foods, Ancillary and Other Businesses, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gas and travel were better year over year as they anniversary a softer quarter a year ago, offset by e-comm, which was particularly strong a year ago and also related to the pandemic. LIFO, we had a 3-basis-point or $14 million LIFO charge in the quarter. 2% Reward, higher by 3 on a reported basis and lower by 1, excluding gas inflation, a reflection of slightly higher sales penetration going to the increased number of executive members. And other was up 12 basis points., Gas and Travel, E-Commerce, LIFO Charge, 2% Reward, Other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This is related to COVID-related costs from a year ago. That portion of the COVID-related wages that go into the cost of sales like many of our manufacturing businesses and our meat and bakery departments. Given the inflationary pressures and our ongoing efforts to mitigate price increases to our members in the face of inflation as best we can, our Q1 gross margin\\'s results, all in all, I think, were pretty good. Moving to SG&A., COVID-Related Costs, Cost of Sales, Gross Margin Performance, Inflation Mitigation\\nEfforts, SG&A, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year over year by 66 basis points and 29 basis points, excluding gas inflation. Again, jotting down two columns of numbers, first column being reported and the second column being ex gas inflation. Operations was better or lower by 40 basis points, and ex gas inflation, better or lower by 11 basis points. Central, reported better by 10; without inflation -- gas inflation, better by 6; stock compensation, better by 2 and worse by 1 in the two columns; and other, better by 14 and better by 13 year over year., Operations, Central, Stock Compensation, Other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Total then, again, on a reported basis, our SG&A was better or lower by 66 basis points, and ex gas inflation, lower or better by 29 basis points. Keep in mind, the terms of the core, again, better by 40 or better by 11 ex gas inflation. Keep in mind, this result includes the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that began in March of 2021 and four weeks of additional starting wage increases that we just took this past October, going from $16 to $17 and from $16.50 to $18 for our two main categories of hourly employees. These latest changes in the starting wages went into effect October 25, just six weeks ago, and four weeks of those six weeks were included in Q1., SG&A, wage increase, starting wages, core, Q1, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Central, and that\\'s -- no surprises there. Again, on an ex gas inflation basis, better by 6; stock comp, as I mentioned, a little better, a little worse by 1 ex gas inflation; and other, the 14 and the 13 basis points numbers. This consisted of a COVID expense of $159 million last year and the $118 million write-off of the impacted IT assets that I mentioned earlier. Next on the income statement is preopening expense., Central, Stock Compensation, Other, Preopening Expense, COVID Expense, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This year in the quarter, $28 million; last year in the quarter, $22 million or $6 million higher. All told, reported operating income in the first quarter increased 18%, coming in at $1.693 billion this year in the quarter compared to $1.43 billion last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $39 million each of the first quarters of fiscal \\'21 and \\'22. Interest income -- interest expense, rather., Operating Income, Interest Expense, Interest Income, Q1, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $13 million year over year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall, reported pre-tax income in the first quarter was up 19%, coming in at $1.696 billion this year compared in the first quarter last year of $1.42 billion. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of \\'22 was 20.7% compared to 16.8% in Q1 last year. Again, both years\\' tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier, at $91 million this year and $75 million last year in the quarter., Pre-tax Income, Tax Rate, Stock Compensation, Favorable FX, Q1, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Additionally, last year\\'s tax rate benefited from the tax deductibility of the special dividend, that portion payable to the company\\'s 401(k) plan participants. The fiscal \\'22 effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items, is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, as you know, for fiscal \\'21, we opened 22 units, including two relos, so a net increase of 20 units during fiscal \\'21., Tax Rate, Warehouse Expansion, Discrete Items, Q1, Fiscal \\'22, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, And this quarter that ended a couple of weeks ago, we opened nine units, including one relo, so net openings of eight. For the remainder of the year, we plan to open 23 new units and also -- plan to open 23 units, four of which would be relocations. So, a net of 19, if all goes as planned. It\\'s been a busy past seven days., T8, Net Openings, Remainder of Year, Planned Openings, Busy Past Seven Days, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We opened our second Costco in France last Saturday on December 4, followed by our second building in China, which opened yesterday, as well as two buildings opening this morning -- opening today, one in the U.S. and Florida and our fourth unit in Spain. Regarding capex, our first quarter fiscal \\'22 spend was approximately $1.05 billion. Our full year capex spend is estimated to be just about $4 billion., Capex, Openings, France, China, U.S., Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This would represent an increase of more than $400 million over last year\\'s entire capex figure of $3.6 billion. The largest areas of increase coming from international spending for new warehouse expansion and increased investment in our logistics and e-comm fulfillment operations. In terms of e-commerce sales in the quarter, ex FX increased 13.3% year over year, and that\\'s, of course, on top of an 86% plus increase a year ago in the first quarter. Stronger apartments in terms of year of percentages include jewelry, tires, and home furnishings., Capex, International Spending, Logistics, E-comm Fulfillment, E-commerce Sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our largest merchandise department in terms of sales majors, which is everything from consumer electronics and TVs to appliances, etc., was up in the high single digits, also on a very strong sales increase a year earlier. In terms of an update on Costco Logistics, it continues to drive our big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics deliveries were up over 50% and now represent about 70% of our U.S. e-comm big and bulky shipments., Merchandise Sales, Costco Logistics, E-comm Big and Bulky Shipments, U.S., Strong Sales Increase, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Average, we\\'ve averaged during the quarter more than 50,000 stops per week. And for the year, we project more than 3 million stops, which would be anything from dropping something off to installing and taking away the old appliance for logistics in the full year. Our e-comm mobile app, we continue to improve the site with additional features. Thus far, as I\\'ve talked about in the last few quarters -- quarterly calls, we redesigned the app header and footer., Average Stops, E-comm Mobile App, Logistics, Full Year, Improvements, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We\\'ve updated and improved the menu layout. Our members now have the ability to view warehouse receipts online via both the app and desktop. Our co-brand Citi/Visa card is now linked -- can now be linked to the digital membership card and can be used for payment. Our members are now able to much more easily reschedule e-comm deliveries in the U.S., Menu Layout, Online Viewing, Digital Membership Card, Co-brand Card, E-comm Delivery Rescheduling, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Canada, same goes for rescheduling returns, returns pickups. And delivering in the first half of the new -- upcoming new calendar year, labeling a fulfillment -- a better labeling of fulfillment methods, members will be able to easily see fulfillment options, be it e-comm, same day and even nearby warehouse availability of a particular item -- at a particular level. We\\'re rolling out new e-comm kiosks in the warehouse, with video signage and easy touch screen ordering. As well, we\\'re rolling out e-commerce lockers., Rescheduling Returns, Fulfillment Methods, E-comm Kiosks, Video Signage, E-commerce Lockers, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Currently, in the U.S., we have 112 locations with more -- and we plan to more than double that number during calendar year 2022. In terms of e-commerce, there\\'s a program that received some press just yesterday called Costco Next. In a way, it\\'s like our warehouse roadshows but online. Currently, there are 34 suppliers and growing, but it\\'s still quite small, offering just under 1,000 items, curated items with Costco value., Current Locations, E-commerce Program, Suppliers, Items Offered, Growth, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, So please check it out when you have a chance. From a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined in 12 weeks ago on the last quarterly call. Each issue ebbs and flows a little bit. But overall, the factors pressuring supply chains, and inflation include port delays container challenges, COVID disruptions, shortages of varying components, raw materials, ingredients, and even packaging supplies, labor cost pressures and truck and driver challenges., Supply Chain Issues, Port Delays, Container Challenges, COVID Disruptions, Inflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Overall, we feel we\\'ve dealt pretty well with the supply chain challenges in terms of delayed container arrivals on the Pacific Coast. About 79% of our import containers are late by an average of 51 days, a few percentage of those are actually a few days early, and many of them are a few days more than 51 late. Virtually all departments are impacted. We\\'ve ordered early in many cases, as I mentioned, I think, earlier -- on earlier calls, given the longer lead times., Supply Chain Challenges, Delayed Container Arrivals, Impact on Departments, Ordering Early, Lead\\nTimes, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Less product and packaging challenges, but still quite a bit. Still some limitations on key items but improving. Again, it ebbs and flows. Chip shortage is still impacting many items, some more than others., Product Challenges, Packaging Challenges, Limitations, Chip Shortage, Flow, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In some instances, delayed inventory simply extends the season. An example might be lawn and garden and patio. As soon as the product arrives, it sells pretty quickly, but it may extend into -- beyond the normal seasonal time. Toys and seasonal, in fact, same thing, some inventory, in fact, won\\'t make it before Christmas, but we\\'ve mitigated that as best as possible and feel pretty good about it., Delayed Inventory, Seasonal Products, Quick Sales, Mitigation Strategies, Christmas, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, And in terms of -- moving on to -- despite all the supply chain issues, again, we\\'re pretty -- feel pretty good about staying in stock and continuing to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. Moving on to inflation. Again, it\\'s pretty much the same story that we told during each of the last two quarters. There have been a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing from labor costs to freight costs, to higher demand, to container shortages and port delays, to increased demand on certain product categories, much of what you see and read out there, various shortages on everything from chips to oils and chemicals still supplied by facilities hit by the gulf storms a while back, higher commodities prices., Supply Chain Issues, Inflation, Cost and Price Increases, Labor Costs, Freight Costs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For Q1 \\'22 and talking with our merchants -- senior merchants, we estimate that overall year-over-year price inflation to be in the 4.5% to 5% range. That\\'s a little bit higher of an estimated inflation rate that I discussed a quarter ago, but I think pretty consistent with what you read out there. All this said, much kudos to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and our operators have all been able to do in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary, and keep our warehouses full, while keeping prices low for our members and continuing to show value versus our competitors. Look, I think overall, this is best reflected in the operating results that we continue to achieve despite these many challenges., Inflation Rate, Price Increases, Merchants, Operators, Competitors, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Anecdotally, on merchandising, holiday stuff has been strong. Again, sometimes it depends on when the merchandise gets in. Banking items, more people seem to be getting together are strong. Gift cards are up dramatically from a year ago, but it was weak a year ago., Strong Merchandise Sales, Holiday Products, Banking Items, Gift Cards, Weak Sales Last Year, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Pet products, as you might expect, are strong with the benefit of increasing pet population over the past couple of years. Alcohol and spirits are strong, including gift boxes of various items. And, of course, continued strength in consumer electronics, appliances, furniture and mattresses, and the like. Apparel actually has enjoyed much stronger sales growth this year, albeit compared to a relatively flat apparel sales a year ago., Strong Sales, Pet Products, Alcohol and Spirits, Consumer Electronics, Apparel, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2022, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, One last comment.

In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to 16 weeks ended August 29. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.67 billion or $3.76 per share. Last year\\'s fourth-quarter net income came in at $1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share., Forward-Looking Statements, Operating Results, Net Income, Quarter End Date, Diluted Share, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, This year\\'s fourth quarter included an $84 million pre-tax or $0.14 a share charge for the write-off of certain IT assets. Last year\\'s fourth quarter included $281 million pre-tax charge or $0.47 a share of COVID-related costs, as well included a $36 million or $0.06 a share pre-tax charge related to the prepayment of $1.5 billion of debt, partially offset by an $84 million or $0.15 per share benefit for the partial reversal of a reserve related to a product tax assessment taken in the fiscal-year 2019. Net sales for the quarter increased 17.5% to $61.44 billion, up from $52.28 billion a year earlier in the fourth quarter. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter, as reported an hour ago, for the 16 weeks on a reported basis, U.S., Net\\nSales, Comparable Sales, Write-Off of IT Assets, COVID-Related Costs, Debt Prepayment Benefit, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, was 14.9%. Excluding gas inflation and FX, the 14.9% would be 10.3% positive. Canada reported 19.5% plus; ex gas inflation and FX, 6.7%. Other international reported 15%., 14.9%, Excluding Gas Inflation and FX, Canada Reported, Other International Reported, 10.3%\\nPositive, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Without gas inflation and FX, 7.3%; total company, 15.5% reported, 9.4% ex gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, by the way, reported was 11.2% positive; ex gas inflation and FX, 8.9%. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.2% worldwide and 8.8% in the U.S. Our average transaction or basket was up 5.8% worldwide and 5.6% in the U.S., 7.3%, Total Company, E-commerce, Q4 Comp Sales Metrics, Traffic or Shopping Frequency, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, during the fourth quarter. Those numbers including the positive impact from gas inflation and FX. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by approximately 230 basis points, whereas gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 385 basis points., Fourth Quarter, Positive Impact, Gas Inflation and FX, Foreign Currencies, Sales Impact, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Moving down the income statement to the membership line. Membership fee income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.234 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. That\\'s up $128 million from the prior year\\'s fourth-quarter membership fee income of $1.106 billion. The $128 million represents an 11.7% increase year over year., Membership Fee Income, Fourth Quarter, Prior Year, Increase Year Over Year, $128 Million, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Excluding the benefit from positive FX, the $128 million positive number would have been $107 million positive or a 9.7% effective increase. In terms of renewal rates, at the fourth quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 91.3%, up 0.3 percentage point from 16-week earlier number at Q3 end. And worldwide rate came in -- renewal rate came in at 88.7%, also up 0.3 percentage point from Q3 and 16 weeks earlier., Excluding FX, Positive Number, Renewal Rates, U.S. Renewal Rate, Worldwide Renewal Rate, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Renewal rates are benefiting, we believe, for more members auto renewing, as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than nonexecutive members. Our first year renewal rates have also improved as well during this time. In terms of number of members at Q4 end, member households and total cardholders, at Q4 -- fiscal year-end a few weeks ago, total paid households were 61.7 million. That\\'s up 1.1 million from the 60.6 million figure we shared with you 16 weeks earlier., Renewal Rates, Auto Renewing, Executive Members, First Year Renewal Rates, Number of Members, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Total cardholders came in at 111.6 million or 1.8 million higher than the 109.8 million we had as of Q3 end. At Q4 end, paid executive members were -- came in at 25.6 million, an increase of a little over 1 million new executive members, and that\\'s during the 16-week period as well. Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year over year by 32 basis points., Total Cardholders, Paid Executive Members, Gross Margin, Year Over Year, Basis Points, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, And actually, excluding gas inflation, it was higher by five basis points. As I usually do, I ask you jot down two columns of numbers, a little gross margin matrix, if you will. The line items will be core merchandise, ancillary -- second line item would be ancillary and other businesses. Third line item would be 2% reward., Excluding Gas Inflation, Gross Margin Matrix, Core Merchandise, Ancillary Businesses, 2% Reward, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Fourth line item would be LIFO. And last line item would be other. And then the -- finally, the last line item would be total. Two columns., Fourth Quarter, Prior Year, Increase Year Over Year, Gross Margin Matrix, LIFO, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, The first one being reported year over year in the fourth quarter, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. So core merchandise on a reported basis was lower year over year by 90 basis points. Ex gas inflation, it was lower, minus 57 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 44 on a reported basis and plus 53 ex gas inflation., Reported Basis, Excluding Gas Inflation, Core Merchandise, Ancillary Businesses, Other Businesses, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, 2% reward, plus one basis point and minus three year over year on ex gas inflation. LIFO, minus five and minus five basis points. And other, plus 18 and plus 17. If you add up to two columns, you get the total for reported, the 32 basis points that I just mentioned., 2% Reward, Excluding Gas Inflation, LIFO, Other, Total, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, And again, ex gas inflation, plus five basis points. Now the core merchandise component you see here are lower by 90 year over year and lower by 57 ex gas inflation. Similar to last quarter, this is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus the last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core., Excluding Gas Inflation, Core Merchandise, Ancillary Businesses, Sales Shift, Historical Sales\\nPenetrations, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the fourth quarter, the core-on-core margins were lower by 40 basis points with nonfood slightly up, food and sundries slightly lower year over year. Fresh foods was down and was the fundamental driver of the core, and core being lower in the quarter. Now fresh foods is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales a year ago in Q4. We retained some of that productivity gains -- some of those productivity gains as volumes have remained high., Core Margin, Nonfood Sales, Food and Sundries Sales, Fresh Foods\\nSales, Product Spoilage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, However, we\\'ve also elected to hold, delay and/or mitigate some of the price increases in this increasingly inflationary environment over the last few months. Ancillary and other business gross margin, as you see in the chart in the matrix, was higher by 44 basis points and higher by 53 ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gasoline had a good quarter as we are lapping year over year a softer quarter due to the pandemic. We also showed improvement in food court, optical, travel, all of which were benefited by easy compares versus last year, also due to the impacts of COVID on those businesses., Price Increases, Ancillary Business Gross Margin, Gasoline Sales, Food Court Sales, Travel Sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Now LIFO, this is a gross margin charge that we haven\\'t seen in this matrix for about seven years. LIFO was lower by five basis points, both with and without gas inflation. We had a $30 millio\\xa0 \\xa0n LIFO charge in the quarter, the first such charge since 2014. This is a result of the continued inflationary cost pressures, which I\\'ll discuss more in a few minutes., LIFO Charge, Gross Margin, Inflationary Cost Pressures, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, 2% reward, higher by one basis point on a reported basis, but more importantly, lower by three basis points ex gas inflation, again, implying a slightly higher penetration of sales going to the executive member and the associated rewards that come with it. And other is up 18 basis points and then up 17 ex gas inflation. This is primarily related to COVID-related costs from a year ago. Moving to SG&A., 2% Reward, Gas Inflation Penetration, Other Costs, SG&A, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter was lower or better year over year by 45 basis points and lower or better by 13 basis points, excluding gas inflation. Second matrix of the day, the two columns reported and ex gas inflation and five line items: operations; second line item, central; third line item, stock compensation; fourth line item, other; and then total. On a reported basis, core operations was lower or better by plus 19 basis points and ex gas inflation higher by eight basis points or minus eight basis points. Central, plus 12 and plus eight., Reported SG&A, Gas Inflation Penetration, Core Operations, Central Costs, Other Costs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Stock compensation, plus two and plus two. And other, plus 12 and plus 11. Adding up the columns again, SG&A on a reported basis was better or lower by 45 basis points and lower ex gas inflation by 13. As you can see in the matrix, the core operations component again was better by 19 and higher by -- lower by 19 and then -- or higher by eight, excluding the impact from gas inflation., SG&A, Reported Basis, Gas Inflation Penetration, Core Operations, Other Costs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Keep in mind, this result includes the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that we implemented in March of this year. This higher by eight basis point year-over-year expense result includes the 14 basis point cost of the $1 an hour wage increase. Central, again, improved by eight basis points ex gas inflation. And stock compensation, also with strong sales, helped by two basis points., Wage Increase, Central Costs, Stock Compensation, Gas Inflation Penetration, Other Costs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Now the other of plus 12 or plus 11 without gas inflation, so lower -- that was another basis points. Included in other last year was the COVID expense of $217 million or 42 basis points and the reversal of a product tax assessment reserve of $84 million or 16 basis points. This year includes the write-off of the IT assets totaling $84 million or 14 basis points. So you add all those up, that\\'s where you get the 11., Other Costs, COVID Expense, Product Tax Assessment Reserve, IT Asset Write-off, Gas Inflation\\nPenetration, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement is preopening. Preopening this year was $35 million. Last year, $26 million, so higher by $9 million. Preopening is up year over year in part due to the timing of openings and given different amount of preopening on a given location but within the quarter and in the following quarter., Preopening, Income Statement, Timing of Openings, Different Amount of Preopening, Gas Inflation\\nPenetration, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased by 18%, coming in at $2.275 billion this year, compared to $1.929 billion a year earlier. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $52 million this year, essentially the same at $51 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $77 million year over year. Roughly half of that is due to favorable FX, and the other half is related to last year\\'s fourth quarter charge for the make-whole debt prepayment., Reported Operating Income, Interest Expense, Interest Income and Other, Favorable FX, Make-Whole\\nDebt Prepayment, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Overall, reported pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 came in up 23%, coming in at $2.291 billion, compared to last year\\'s $1.869 billion. Now our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.1%, higher than last year\\'s fourth-quarter rate of 24.9%. For fiscal \\'22, based on our current estimates, which, of course, can always change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate to be similar to fiscal \\'21, somewhere in the 26% to 27% range. Unless, of course, there are changes to the U.S., Reported Pre-Tax Earnings, Tax Rate, Fiscal \\'22 Tax Rate, U.S. Tax Changes, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, corporate tax rates, we\\'ll have to see -- wait and see. A few other items of note, warehouse expansion. For fiscal \\'21 we just ended, we opened net openings of 20. We actually had 22 openings, including two relocations, but a total increase of 20 net units., Warehouse expansion, fiscal \\'21, net openings, tax rates, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, This year, we\\'re looking to open at least 25 net new units, including second warehouses in each of China and France and our first location in New Zealand. As well, we plan to relocate five locations. Regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter 2021 spend, capital expenditure was approximately $1.09 billion. Our full-year capex spend was $3.59 billion., New unit openings, warehouse expansion, capital expenditures, relocation, full-\\nyear capex spend, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, As I mentioned in last quarter\\'s call, this included a relatively recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. For e-commerce, e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX increased by 8.9% year over year. That\\'s on top of last year\\'s Q4 e-commerce sales increase of 91%. Stronger departments, jewelry., Distribution facility, e-commerce sales, year-over-year growth, stronger\\ndepartments, jewelry, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, We actually sold a couple of rings in the $100,000 range. Home furnishings was strong. Pharmacy was strong. And sporting goods was strong., Rings, home furnishings, pharmacy, sporting goods, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, A couple of other large departments like majors and electronics, while very good sales, we had really outsized sales a year ago in the fourth quarter during COVID. Update on Costco Logistics. Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics sales within -- our delivery was up 130%, and in the quarter, represented 24% of all sales on our U.S., Costco Logistics, big and bulky sales, delivery, quarterly sales, majors and\\nelectronics, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, e-commerce site. That compares to -- that 24%, compared to 11% of e-commerce sales last year. Remind you, much of that relates to moving things from other third parties to our own internal logistics department. Approximately -- currently, approximately 7,000 to 10,000 daily deliveries via Costco Logistics are occurring and continuing to grow., e-commerce site, e-commerce sales, internal logistics department, daily\\ndeliveries, Costco Logistics growth, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of our e-comm app, we have over 10 million downloads. It\\'s continually improving, with additional features coming soon. Digital payment using the Costco credit card, it\\'s in pilot in several locations with full rollout by the middle of next month. The ability to view warehouse receipts online, also next month., e-comm app, digital payment, warehouse receipts, pilot locations, full rollout, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, More detail on online purchases as well. And by October end, we -- an improved mobile site, improved look and feel, a new landing page and expanded information both for dot-com use and for enhanced warehouse information. From a supply chain perspective -- I want to go back to two things, supply chain and inflation. From a supply chain perspective, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials and ingredients, labor cost pressures and trucker and driver shortages -- trucks and driver shortages., Online purchases, mobile site, supply chain perspective, inflation, port delays, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Domestically, anecdotally rather, from -- even on the domestic side, various major brands are requesting longer lead times, some cases, difficulty in finding drivers and trucks on short notice. Lead times on ingredients and packaging have been extended in some cases. So planning is crucial, which I feel we -- our people have done a great job with that over the last several months. Also, we\\'re putting some limitations on key items, like bath tissues, roll towels, Kirkland Signature water, high-demand cleaning-related SKUs related to the uptick in Delta-related demand., Domestic lead times, finding drivers and trucks, ingredients and packaging, key item\\nlimitations, Delta-related demand, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Furniture delays and some shortages have caused traditional rollout times to go from eight to 12 weeks -- from eight to 12 weeks up to 16 to 18 weeks. In some ways, we think that\\'s an advantage. We\\'re selling out generally merchandise once it\\'s received within two weeks on most items. And we\\'ve ordered more and earlier., furniture delays, shortages, traditional rollout times, merchandise selling,\\nordering more early, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Same thing with toys in season, we\\'re bringing in some of the items early. Chip shortages impacting many items, as I mentioned in the last call. Examples of impacted items: computers, tablets, video games, major appliances. Feeling is from the buyers is this will likely extend into 2022., toys in season, chip shortages, impacted items, buyers\\' feeling, 2022 extension, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Again, we\\'re ordering as much as we can and getting it in earlier. And I think as evidenced by the most recent sales results, we\\'re doing OK with this. Despite these issues -- sorry, in terms of transportation costs, they\\'re increasing. We\\'re reading about it every day., ordering more, earlier, transportation costs, sales results, increasing, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Containers, trucks and drivers all are impacting the timing of deliveries and higher freight costs. Despite all these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases in a variety of different ways and hold down and/or mitigate our price increases passed on to the members. We\\'ve also chartered three ocean vessels for the next year to transport containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada., containers, trucks, drivers, freight costs, price increases, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, And we\\'ve leased several thousand containers for use on these ships. Every ship can carry 800 to 1,000 containers at a time, and we\\'ll make approximately 10 deliveries during the course of the next year. Moving to inflation. Again, there have been many -- there have been a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing, and more of it., containers leasing, ship capacity, delivery frequency, inflationary pressures, more\\ninflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, As I discussed on last quarter\\'s call, inflationary factors abound: higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with container shortages and port delays, increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils and chemicals, higher commodities prices. It\\'s a lot of fun right now. Some inflationary soundbites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the oceans, some suppliers or us paying to six times for containers and shipping., inflationary factors, higher labor costs, higher freight costs, container\\nshortages, port delays, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Price increases of pulp and paper goods, some items up 4% to 8%. Again, we\\'re trying to mitigate those where we can, and we think we\\'ve done a decent job of mitigating some of it. Plastics, resin increases on things like trash bags, Ziploc SKUs, pet products -- resin or [Inaudible] PET products, plastic cups, plates, plastic wrap, many items up in the 5% to 11% range. Metals, again, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases, as well as cans for sodas and other beverages., price increases, pulp and paper goods, plastics, resin increases, metals, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, I mentioned commodities earlier, oil, coffee, nuts, they remain generally according to our buyers at five-year highs and so on. Higher import prices on things from Europe like cheeses, but the combination of freight and FX. 3% to 10% increases on certain but not all apparel items. And fresh foods, inflation is up in the mid- to high single digits, with meat leading the way, up high single to low double digits due to feed, labor and transportation costs., commodities, oil, coffee, nuts, import prices, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Now I was asked back in March at our second-quarter earnings call, at what level we felt inflation was running overall on the sell price side. I stated that our best guess at the time was somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. I updated that 16 weeks earlier -- 16 weeks ago on our May 26 third-quarter call, and we estimate to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. As of today and talking with our senior merchants, we would estimate overall price inflation of the products we\\'re selling to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range., inflation estimate, sell price side, merchants\\' estimates, product categories,\\nfreight costs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, As I discussed earlier, this inflation was the driver of the $30 million LIFO charge that we took in the quarter. But all of this said, I feel very good with the job that our merchants, our traffic department and our operators have all been doing and able to -- in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary and keep our warehouses full while keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continue to show incredible value versus our competitors. I think this is reflected in our strong reported sales and profits that we\\'ve achieved despite challenges and our typical aggressive pricing. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, October 3, on Wednesday, October 6, after the market close., inflation, LIFO charge, merchants\\' performance, warehouse management, upcoming\\nsales results, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 4, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, And with that, I will open it up for questions with Ann.

I\\'ll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\\'s call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company\\'s public statements and reports filed with the SEC., forward-looking statements, Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, risk\\nand uncertainties, actual events, performance differences, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 to 12 weeks ended this past May 9. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.220 billion or $2.75 per diluted share. Last year\\'s third-quarter net income came in at $838 million or $1.89 per share., forward-looking statements, operating results, net income, diluted share, year-\\nover-year comparison, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, This year\\'s third quarter included $57 million pre-tax or $0.09 per share in COVID-19-related costs. Last year\\'s third quarter included $283 million pre-tax or $0.47 per share of COVID-19-related costs. Net sales for the quarter increased year over year in the quarter by 21.7% from $44.38 billion -- to $44.38 billion this year from $36.45 billion a year ago. Comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal \\'21 were as follows: in the U.S., on a reported basis, sales or comparable sales were up 18%, ex gas inflation, up 15.2%; Canada, on a reported basis, up 32.3%, ex both gas and strong Canadian dollar, ex gas and FX, up 16.7%; other international reported plus 22.9%, ex gas and FX, plus 13.1%., COVID-19 costs, net sales, comparable sales, U.S. sales, international sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, All told, company reported comp sales of 20.6% and, again, ex gas and FX, 15.1% up; e-commerce, on a reported basis, was 41.2%, ex FX was up 38.2%, and that\\'s on top of a year ago in the third quarter when it was up 66.1% in Q3 a year ago versus the prior year to that. In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 12.5% worldwide and plus 11.9% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.3% worldwide and up 5.7% U.S. during the third quarter., comp sales, e-commerce, traffic, transaction size, shopping frequency, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, And these numbers include the positive impact both of gas inflation and FX. So adjusting for that, they would be in the 1.8% and 2.7% in the U.S. adjusted for those. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S., gas inflation, foreign currencies, U.S. sales, international sales, adjusted\\nsales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 290 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 260 basis points. Going down the income statement. Membership fee income reported for the third quarter, $901 million or 2.03% of sales., sales impact, gas inflation impact, membership fee income, income statement, basis\\npoints, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Again, we had strong FX and so adjusting for that out, the $86 million reported increase would have been up $67 million, so FX up 8.2%, on a reported basis up 10.6%. In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian rate came in at 91%, the same as it was at Q2 end. Worldwide, our total company renewal rate was 88.4% at Q3 end or 0.1% lower during the prior quarter-end., FX impact, reported increase, renewal rates, U.S. rate, worldwide rate, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, China entered the renewal calculation for the first time this fiscal quarter. First-year renewal rates generally lag those of later years. And excluding China, the worldwide rate would have actually improved 0.1% versus the prior quarter. In terms of number of members at Q3 end, both member households and total cardholders, At the end of third quarter, total paid households 60.6 million, up from 59.7 million 12 weeks earlier., China, renewal rates, worldwide rate, member households, total cardholders, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Total cardholders, 109.8 million, up from 108.3 million at the end of the second quarter 12 weeks ago. At Q3 end, paid executive membership totaled 24.6 million members, an increase of 817,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end. Moving down to gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year over year by 35 basis points, coming in at 11.18%, compared to a year ago at 11.53%., total cardholders, paid executive membership, gross margin, year over year\\ncomparison, basis points, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, As I usually do, I ask you to jot down a few numbers, two columns, both the reported year-over-year change in gross margin and the second column, ex gas inflation. Merchandise core, reported minus 52 basis points year over year and ex gas inflation, minus 29 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses reported plus 2 basis points and ex gas inflation plus 7 basis points. 2% Reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 2 basis points., gross margin change, gas inflation impact, merchandise core, ancillary and other\\nbusinesses, 2% Reward, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Other, plus 14 basis points in both columns. Total, therefore, reported gross margin, again, year over year was reported down 35 basis points and ex gas inflation down 10 basis points. The core merchandise component, as you show here was -- as I mentioned here, was down 52 basis points year over year and down 29% on ex gas inflation. This is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations., gross margin change, gas inflation impact, merchandise core, ancillary and other\\nbusinesses, total change, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Recall, last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in third quarter, the core and core margin were better by plus 27 basis points, with nonfood up significantly, rebounding from last year\\'s lows. Food and sundries flat year over year and fresh foods down from last year, the latter still strong by historical standards. Fresh, as we\\'ve mentioned over the last few quarters, is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales that began a year ago in Q3 with the onset of COVID., ancillary and other businesses, core margin, nonfood sales, food and sundries,\\nfresh foods, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Ancillary and other business gross margins, again, ex gas inflation was up 7 basis points year over year in the quarter. We have a lot going on here as last year we had closed the hearing aid and optical departments and had severely limited the service and selection at our food courts for most of Q3 last year. Gas had a particularly good quarter a year ago, which had helped to offset some of those closures a year ago. This year, we\\'re showing margin improvement in optical, food court, e-comm, and hearing aids, somewhat offset by gas., ancillary and other business gross margins, year over year change, gas impact,\\noptical department, food court, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, The 2% Reward was, again, on excluding gas inflation, was lower by 2 basis points, indicating higher sales penetration to our executive members and the rewards associated with it. And other is plus 14 basis points. Nine of the 14 basis points is attributable to lower COVID-19 costs year over year, $44 million hit to margin in Q3 a year ago versus a $14 million hit to margin this year in the third quarter. Last year, we incurred 10 weeks of the incremental $2 an hour premium wage., 2% Reward, excluding gas inflation, COVID-19 costs, premium wage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, That portion you see here relates to the labor associated with our fulfillment manufacturing businesses. This year, we incurred two weeks of the incremental two hour -- the incremental $2 an hour premium wage as the program was discontinued at the end of the second week of Q3 after 52 weeks in place. The other plus 5 basis points or $19.7 million came from accruing a reserve last year in Q3 for certain third-party gift cards and ticket programs that were adversely impacted by the onset of COVID. One other comment, as I discussed during our March 4 Q2 earnings conference call., labor costs, premium wage, COVID-19 impact, gift cards, ticket programs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In conjunction with the discontinuing of the $2 an hour premium pay, we implemented a permanent wage increase for our hourly employees, as well as most of our salaried manager employees, which took effect in week 3 of this fiscal quarter. Since it\\'s a permanent wage increase going forward, its impact is simply in our reported numbers and not separated out as COVID-related. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year over year by 107 basis points., wage increase, COVID-related, SG&A, year over year change, permanent wage\\nincrease, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Again, to jot down these following two columns and numbers, first column is reported, and second column, excluding gas inflation. In terms of operations, year over year, plus 37 basis points, meaning lower or better by 37 basis points, ex gas inflation, plus 20 basis points. Central plus 4 basis points and plus 1 basis point; stock compensation, plus five and plus four; other, plus 61 and plus 61. For a total, on a reported basis, again, SG&A year over year was lower or better by 107 basis points on a reported basis and excluding gas inflation, better by -- or lower by 86 basis points., operations, year over year change, excluding gas inflation, SG&A, stock\\ncompensation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Again, looking here, the core operation was better by 37 and plus -- better by 20, excluding the impact of gas inflation. A good result, particularly given that we implemented a permanent $1 an hour wage increase for the last 10 of the 12 weeks that comprise Q3. Central, nothing surprising there. Same with stock comp, and other, the plus 61 basis points ex gas inflation, 56 of the 61 was attributable to the lower cost from COVID, $239 million hits SG&A in Q3 a year ago, compared to $44 million in Q3 this year., core operations, wage increase, COVID impact, SG&A, stock compensation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, The balance or plus 5 basis points, lower by 5 basis points, was $18.5 million were cost associated with the acquisition and integration of Innovel a year ago. Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Basically, this year, it came in at $10 million, $2 million higher than the $8 million in Q3 of fiscal \\'20. Nothing out of the ordinary with the preopening this quarter., acquisition and integration, preopening expense, income statement, cost\\nassociated, $18.5 million, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, All told, reported operating income in Q3 \\'21 increased 41%, coming in at $1.663 billion this year, compared to $1.179 billion a year ago in the quarter. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $37 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million or better by $6 million. Interest income was actually lower by $2 million year over year due to lower interest rates., operating income, quarterly comparison, interest expense,\\ninterest income, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Additionally, FX and other was higher by $8 million year over year. Overall, reported pre-tax income in the third quarter was up -- reported pre-tax income was up 42%, coming in at $1.650 billion this year, compared to $1.163 billion a year ago. In terms of e-commerce, our e-commerce sales, as I mentioned earlier -- I\\'m sorry, before I go to e-commerce, our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 25.2%, compared to 26.7% a year earlier. This quarter benefited from one-time discrete tax item that benefited our number., pre-tax income, e-commerce sales, tax rate, other, one-time discrete tax item, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, For all of \\'21, based on our estimates, which, of course, are, sadly, subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate for the year to be in the 26% to 27% range. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, in Q3, we opened six new warehouses: one in the U.S., three in Canada, and two internationally. We also have plans in Q4 to open seven additional ones, five in the U.S., and two others internationally., tax rate, warehouse expansion, new openings, international locations, Q4 plans, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, And that would put us in a total of 21 net new warehouses for the fiscal year -- 23, which included two relocations, so 21 net. In addition to the 21 planned openings for fiscal \\'21, we are looking to open about 25 new units, net new units in each of the next two fiscal years, including a second warehouse in China in fiscal \\'22, which would be the end of -- toward the end of calendar \\'21 and a third expected to open in late calendar \\'22, which would be early fiscal year \\'23. Regarding capex, the third-quarter fiscal \\'21 spend was approximately $1.03 billion. Our full-year capex spend is now estimated to be in the $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion range, increased a little from our estimate made 12 weeks earlier to include the recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities., warehouse expansion, new openings, capex spend, fiscal years, distribution\\nfacility, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Now, turning to e-commerce. Again, e-commerce sales in the third quarter ex FX increased 38.2% year over year. Stronger departments included jewelry, home furnishings, sporting goods, hardware, and majors, which, of course, includes both everything from appliances to consumer electronics. In terms of Costco Logistics and an update there, we anniversary-ed the purchase of Innovel, now called Costco Logistics this fiscal quarter., e-commerce sales, FX impact, departmental performance, Costco Logistics, Innovel\\npurchase, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Costco Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales with the U.S. e-comm sales on these items up 53% during the quarter. Costco Logistics fulfilled about 70% of all U.S. big and bulky orders, and we also continue to add some new big and bulky vendors., Costco Logistics, e-commerce sales, big and bulky sales, vendor addition, U.S.\\norders, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Overall, we\\'ve improved delivery time on many items from up to two weeks to in many -- in several cases, now five to seven days. As well, we\\'ve taken several items that were previously vendor-drop shipped and are now being direct imported allowing us to not only speed up delivery but reduce prices to our members. From a supply chain perspective, port delays are continuing to have an impact. We are utilizing additional carriers, in some cases, to help alleviate some of that., delivery time improvement, direct import, supply chain impact, port delays,\\nadditional carriers, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Containers and pallets are also facing shortages anecdotally, 35% to 50% increase in incoming containers this year versus a year ago. Some of that\\'s pent-up demand, but just from the low points a year ago.

Chips shortages are impacting many items from an inflation standpoint, some items more than others. And again, as I mentioned, with regard to containers and shipping, transportation costs have increased as well. Despite these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases and supply chain delays in a variety of different ways as best we can., chips shortages, transportation costs, supply chain delays, inflation impact, cost\\nmitigation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, The biggest way we\\'ve handled supply chain delays is adjusted ordering and front-loading, if you will, orders of many items. And we think we\\'ve got that pretty well under control. This will continue -- the feeling is that this will continue for the most part of this calendar year. We\\'ve had a lot of questions about inflation over the past few months., supply chain delays, adjusted ordering, front-loading,\\ninflation, supply chain control, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, There have been and are a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing. Inflationary factors abound. These include higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with the container shortage and port delays that I mentioned, increased demand in various product categories some shortages, various shortages of everything from chips to oils and chemical supplies by facilities hit by the Gulf freeze and storms and, in some cases, higher commodity prices. Some inflationary sound bites if you will., inflation, labor costs, freight costs, transportation demand, supply shortages, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Price increases on items shipped across the ocean with suppliers paying up to double for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp, paper goods, some things up 4% to 8%, plastic and resin increases from trash bags to plastic cups, plates, etc., and plastic wraps. Metals, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases also cans for sodas and other beverages.

Beef in the last month has been up as much as 20%. Some of that is due to feed labor and transportation costs, as well as restocking some of the additional increased demand coming now from institutional needs as restaurants start to reopen. And the list could go on and on., fresh protein prices, meat prices, beef prices, feed costs, transportation costs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Now, all this being said, I was asked back on our March 4 second-quarter call. At what level we felt inflation was running overall at that time with our goods. I stated that our best guess was somewhere in the 1% to 1.5% range. As of today, we guess that overall price inflation at the selling level, and excluding our gasoline sales, would be estimated to be probably more in the 2.5% to 3.5% range., inflation rate, price inflation, selling level, gasoline sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 3, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Some items are up more and some items, the sale prices haven\\'t yet changed. And some items are even down a little bit. We think, again, we\\'ve done pretty well in terms of controlling that as best as we can, but the inflation pressures abound.

A few single-serve items like cookies and crackers, take-out only, no-cook to prepared sample items, and a few enhanced talking demos such as items for display only.

In the press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the 12 weeks ended February 14, as well as February retail sales results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28. Reported net income for the quarter was $951 million or $2.14 per share, compared to $931 million or $2.10 per diluted share last year.

Comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal \\'21 were as follows: For the 12-week period, U.S. comps were reported at 11.4%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, 12.6%; Canada reported at 13.4%, ex gas deflation and FX, 10.6%; Other international reported at 21.5%, ex gas deflation, and FX, 17.7%; Our total company reported at 13% and ex gas deflation and FX, 12.9%; E-commerce on a reported basis was 75.8% and ex FX, 74.8%.

In terms of number of members as of Q2 end both member households and cardholders, in terms of households at Q2 end, we came in at 59.7 million, up from 59.1 million 12 weeks earlier; and total cardholders 108.3 million, up from 107.1 million 12 weeks earlier. As of Q2, paid executive members were 23.8 million, an increase of 506,000 during the 12 weeks since Q1 end. Moving down the income statement to the gross margin., renewal rates, memberships, household growth, cardholder growth, paid executive\\nmembers, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This year\\'s gross margin came in at 10.96%, 2 basis points lower than last year\\'s second quarter on a reported basis of 10.98%. Excluding gas deflation, it would have been 11 basis points lower. As I always ask you, we\\'ll do a little chart here to show some of the components of margin. Two columns reported and the second column without gas deflation., gross margin, reported basis, excluding gas deflation, components of margin, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, First line item would be core merchandise. On a reported basis, core merchandise margin year over year came in at plus 71 basis points; ex gas deflation, plus 63 basis points. Second line item, ancillary businesses, minus 53 basis points; and then without gas, minus 55. 2%, reward, minus 6 and minus 5., core merchandise margin, year-over-year comparison, ancillary businesses, gas deflation\\nimpact, reward programs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Other, minus 14 and minus 14. So all told on a reported basis, year over year minus 2 basis points; and again ex gas deflation, minus 11 basis points. So as you can see from this chart, the core merchandise component was higher by ex gas deflation by 63 basis points. Similar to the last several fiscal quarters, sales penetration has shifted to the core business, resulting in higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus a year earlier., core merchandise, year-over-year comparison, gas deflation impact, sales penetration,\\ncontribution margin, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation only to their own sales, core, and core, if you will, margins year over year were higher by 71 basis points. Fresh foods was, again, the biggest driver here. With strong sales in fresh, we benefited from the efficiency gains in labor productivity and significantly lower spoilage. That being said, the other three major merchandise categories, food and sundries, softlines, and hardlines all had higher-margin percentages year over year in the quarter as well., core merchandise categories, sales growth, margin growth, labor productivity, spoilage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ancillary and other business gross margin was lower by 53 basis points and by 55 ex gas deflation in the quarter, with most of the negative impact coming from gas; and to a lesser extent from the aggregate of travel, hearing aids, pharmacy, and food courts; offset a little bit by a positive impact from e-com. Costco Logistics, which was our Innovel acquisition a year ago, impacted ancillary margins by 6 basis points to the negative. 2% reward you can see was impacted negatively by 5 basis points, implying that higher penetration of our sales are coming from the executive membership group. And other is the minus 14 basis points., ancillary and other business gross margin, gas deflation impact, travel, hearing aids,\\npharmacy, food courts, Costco Logistics, 2% reward program, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, All of this is attributable to the cost of COVID-19 or about $60 million of the $246 million previously mentioned. These are the direct costs for incremental wages allocated to our manufacturing, production, and fulfillment operations. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was higher or worse year over year by 11 basis points on a reported basis, coming in at 9.89% versus 9.78% a year earlier., COVID-19 costs, direct costs, incremental wages, SG&A expenses, reported basis, year-\\nover-year comparison, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The minus 11 ex gas deflation, that would have been a minus 3. Again, doing a little chart of comparison with two columns, both reported and then without gas deflation. First line item would be operations, a plus 31, so lower or better by 31 basis points. Core operations was on a reported basis without gas deflation, plus 38, so lower or better by 38 basis points., operations, core operations, reported basis, gas deflation impact, year-over-year\\ncomparison, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Central, minus 3 basis points and minus 2.

SG&A in the core, excluding the COVID-related expenses which I\\'ll discuss in a moment, was significantly leveraged with the strong core merchandise sales increases. Central, again, minus 2 ex gas deflation, stock comp plus 3, both small year-over-year basis points changes together, pretty much a wash. And other was a minus 42 basis points hit to SG&A, which were incremental wage and benefit costs related to COVID or $186 million of that $246 million total amount., core operations, SG&A expenses, COVID-related expenses, central expenses, other expenses, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, So $60 million of the $246 million hits the margin, and $186 million of the $246 million hits SG&A. I\\'d like to take a minute here and discuss our COVID-related expenses and how they are changing effective this past Monday, March 1. Over the past 12-month period, March 2020 through February 2021, companywide we expended approximately $1.060 billion pre-tax on COVID-related items. Of this amount, approximately $825 million related specifically to the $2 an hour extra hourly pay., COVID-related expenses, pre-tax expenditure, extra hourly pay, SG&A impact, margin\\nimpact, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The remaining $200 million-plus was made up of several other items, including the few-month period where employees 65 and older were paid to stay home. This was early on during the original lockdowns. Cleaning and masks supplies, paying wages to several -- for several weeks to our third-party demo service employees; and assisting employees with paid child care leave, which continues. With the $2 an hour extra pay having been paid in for full year, that extra amount has been discontinued as of this past Sunday, February 28., COVID-related expenses, paid leave, extra hourly pay, discontinued pay, other expenses, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, And effective March 1, a few days ago, we have implemented a permanent wage increase for hourly employees, as well as most salaried warehouse employees. In the U.S. and Canada, we are permanently increasing our starting wage and most wage steps above that by $1 an hour; and increasing our top of scale hourly wage by $0.45 an hour on top of the previously planned $0.55 an hour increase for top of scale. With these changes, our entry-level hourly wages will increase from $15 and $15.50 an hour to $16 and $16.50 an hour., wage increase, starting wage, wage steps, top of scale wage, entry-level wages, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Similar type increases are occurring in other countries where we operate. With this change, along with the reduction and/or elimination of several components of the $200 million-plus expenses I just discussed, on a going-forward basis, this $1 billion-plus expense over the past 12 months will be reduced by a little over one-half starting March 1, which is the beginning of week 3 in the current fiscal third quarter. Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pretty much the same year over year., wage increase, starting wage, wage steps, top of scale wage, entry-level wages, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This year came in at $9 million, compared to last year\\'s $7 million, so $2 million higher. In both fiscal quarters, there were zero openings, although this relates to upcoming openings as well. All told, reported operating income for the second quarter of 2021, including the $246 million mentioned earlier, showed an increase of 5.8%, coming in at $1.34 billion this year, compared to $1.266 billion last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $34 million last year., pre-opening expenses, operating income, reported income, interest expense, fiscal\\nquarters, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $26 million year over year. Interest income itself was lower by $19 million due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was lower by $7 million. Overall reported pre-tax income in the second quarter was up 3.3%, coming in at $1.319 billion this year, compared to $1.277 billion a year earlier., interest income, other income, interest rates, foreign exchange, pre-tax income, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter was 26.4%, a little higher than the 25.9% recorded in Q2 of last year. For all of \\'21 based on our current estimates, which of course these are always subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate for the fiscal year to be in the 26% to 27% range. A few other items to note in terms of warehouse expansion. As I mentioned, there were no openings in Q2., income taxes, tax rate, fiscal year, warehouse expansion, openings, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, There were eight net new openings in Q1, so we\\'re eight year-to-date. In the second half of the fiscal year, but this quarter, in the fourth fiscal quarter, we plan to open 13 more net new units. Five of those will be in the U.S., three will be in Canada, and five will be in overseas. Regarding capex, in the second quarter of fiscal \\'21, we spent approximately $573 million., new openings, year-to-date, fiscal quarter, capex, overseas, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our full-year capex spend is still estimated in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range. Moving on to e-commerce. E-commerce sales overall for the quarter ex FX increased 75% year over year.

The comp numbers just mentioned follow our usual convention, which excludes our third-party same-day grocery program, which was up 450% year over year in the quarter. If we include the third-party same-day in our e-com comps, the 76% reported comp number would have been 96%. Costco Logistics, formerly known as Innovel, continues to fulfill a greater percentage of our delivery and delivery items and has steadily increased since its acquisition a year ago in March., total online grocery, comp sales, third-party same-day grocery program, Costco Logistics,\\ndelivery, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In Q2, we made it a priority to enhance our white-glove service, which includes assembly or complex installation.

We continue to enjoy strong core merchandise sales., white-glove service, assembly, complex installation, COVID-19, core merchandise sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I think our buying teams have done a great job keeping our buildings in stock, despite outsized demand on some items and some supply chain challenges as well. From a supply chain perspective, overseas freight has continued to be an issue in regards to container shortage and port delays. This has caused timing delays on certain categories, including furniture, sporting goods, lawn and garden, and even some food and sundries items like seafood, imported cheeses, and oils. We expect these pressures to ease in the coming months, but it\\'s impacting everyone, of course., buying teams, supply chain, overseas freight, container shortage, port delays, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Regarding the pressures from high consumer demand, examples of areas where we have some supply issues on the nonfood side: certain electronics due to chip and component shortages like TVs, computers, and smart home-related items; exercise equipment, bikes, and outdoor activity items; lawn and garden items; and appliances. On the food side, canned beverages have some shortages due mostly to the aluminum can issue of shortages. Bacon is up 45% in pounds. And so for whatever reason, there\\'s a lot of demand there, so there\\'s a little bit of challenge there., Supply issues, electronics, shortages, demand, bacon, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gloves, surface cleaning wipes and sanitizing sprays, and some paper goods.

Our focus of course is how can we be more efficient at doing it to determine if this offering can become scalable and make economic sense for us. Turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28, compared to the same period last year. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $14.05 billion, an increase of 15.2% from $12.2 billion last year., pilot, basket size, efficiency, sales results, February sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Again, going down to the numbers that were in the release, on a U.S. on a reported basis were up -- on a same-store sales basis were up 10.3%.

That kind of was the beginning of what we felt was a little bit of pressure for consumers to buy in for fear of lockdown, again primarily related to consumers buying ahead of the anticipated COVID lockdowns and closures. That positively impacted last year\\'s February sales by approximately 3 percentage points. Similarly, sales in week 4 of this February -- this week, week 4 of this year, February, were lower as we anniversary-ed that unusually strong week from a year ago., February sales, last year\\'s sales, COVID lockdowns, consumer buying, sales impact, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The estimated negative impact to the February month was approximately 3.5 percentage points. So the reported numbers of 13.8% and ex gas and FX of 12.3% would have been higher excluding that impact. Our comp traffic or frequency for February was flat to last year worldwide and up 0.7% in the U.S., again with some impact of that last week. Worldwide, the average transaction was up 13.8%, which included positive impacts of 140 basis points from FX and 10 basis points of gas inflation., estimated negative impact, reported numbers, comp traffic, average transaction, FX and gas\\ninflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Foreign currencies year over year relative to the dollar benefited February comps in Canada by 540 basis points, other international by approximately 570 basis points, and total company by 140 basis points. Gas price inflation, again, positively impacted total reported comp sales by about 10 basis points, whereas the average selling price was about 1 percentage point higher year over year.

Ancillary business sales, as mentioned earlier, were down., better-performing departments, housewares, small appliances, home furnishings, meat and deli, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, And they were down in terms of sales in the mid-single digits in February, primarily due to lower year-over-year sales in food court, hearing aids, and gasoline. Overall, a relatively good fiscal second quarter, impacted of course by COVID expenses, impacted both plus and minus by various aspects of our business due to COVID. And certainly, as I mentioned, in the ancillary gas had the biggest of the ancillary hits. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, April 4, on Wednesday, April 7, after the market close., sales, mid-single digits, COVID expenses, ancillary hits, upcoming releases, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Buena. , February comps, international sales, merchandise highlights, department sales, upcoming releases, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Cindy, and good afternoon to everyone.

In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal -- our fiscal-year 2021, the 12 weeks ended November 22. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.166 billion or $2.62 per share, compared to $844 million or $1.90 per diluted share last year. This year\\'s first quarter included tax benefits of $145 million or $0.33 per share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend to the extent received by the company\\'s 401(k) plan participants and $0.17 related to stock-based compensation., forward-looking statements, operating results, net income, tax benefits, stock-based compensation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Last year\\'s first quarter included a $77 million or $0.17 per share tax benefit related to stock-based compensation as well. And this year\\'s results also included the costs related to our COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pre-tax or $0.35 per diluted share. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.9% to $42.35 billion, up from $36.24 billion last year in Q1.

Canada for the 12 weeks reported 16.2%; ex gas and FX, 16.8%. Other International reported 18.7%; ex gas and FX, 17.7%.

Now going down the income statement., gas\\ndeflation, FX impacts, sales impact, income statement, gasoline price deflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Membership fee income came in at $860.9 million, up $57 million or 7.1%. Ex FX, it would have been up $54 million or 6.7%. During the quarter, we opened eight new units. In terms of renewal rates, our U.S., membership fee income, renewal rates, unit openings, FX impacts, quarterly performance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Canada renewal rate as of the end of Q1 \\'21 was 90.9%. That compares to a quarter ago of 91%. And worldwide, it was 88.4%, which was the same as it was a quarter ago.

For example, traffic or frequency in our Canada warehouses in Q1 came in at a minus 1.3%, compared to a plus 7.6% figure in the United States. By the way, the U.S. renewal rate was the same at both quarters\\' end., renewal rate, Canada, deferred renewals, traffic or frequency, U.S., Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of number of members at Q1 end, total paid households at Q1 end was 59.1 million, up from 12 weeks earlier Q4 end of 58.1 million. And total cardholders at Q1 end was 107.1 million, compared to 12 weeks earlier at 105.5 million. Also at first quarter end, paid executive memberships totaled 23.3 million, an increase of 642,000 during the fiscal first quarter. On to the gross margin line., total paid households, total cardholders, paid executive memberships, gross margin, fiscal first\\nquarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our reported gross margin in the first quarter was higher year over year by 50 basis points, coming in at 11.55% of sales, compared to 11.05% a year ago. Excluding gas deflation, the point -- the 50-basis-point increase would be 30 basis points. If you jot down two columns of numbers here to shed a little light on the components of gross margin, on a reported basis in Q1 \\'21, the core merchandise margin year over year was up on a reported basis, 83 basis points, plus 83. Second column without gas deflation would have been plus 66 basis points., gross margin, sales, reported gross margin, merchandise margin, gas deflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ancillary businesses, minus 15 basis points reported and minus 20 ex gas deflation; 2% Reward, minus 6 basis points and minus 4; other, minus 12 and minus 12. And if you add up the two columns, on a reported basis, again, gross margin reported as a percent of sales year over year in the quarter was up 50 basis points on a reported basis and ex gas deflation up 30 basis points. Now the core merchandise component of gross margin shows it was higher by 83 and up 66 ex gas deflation. Similar to last quarter, we had a sales shift from ancillary to core., ancillary businesses, reward, other, gross margin, merchandise component, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus last year. Looking at core merchandise categories in relation only to their own sales, core and core, if you will, margins year over year in the quarter were higher by 65 basis points. Fresh foods was again the biggest driver here. With strong sales in fresh, we benefited from efficiency gains in labor productivity and significantly lower product spoilage., gross margin, contribution, core operations, core merchandise categories, fresh foods, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Food and sundries, softlines and hardlines, the other three main core components, all had higher margins year over year in the quarter as well, but fresh foods was the driver. Ancillary and other businesses gross margins, as I showed you here, was lower on a reported basis by 15 basis points and minus 20 ex gas deflation, most of the impact coming from travel and, to a lesser extent, from gas, optical, hearing aids and food courts. Costco Logistics, which is our name for the acquisition of Innovel that we did several months ago, impacted ancillary margins by minus 6 basis points, a slight relative improvement from the prior quarter year over year. 2% Reward, nothing surprising there., fresh foods, ancillary businesses, other businesses, Costco Logistics, 2% Reward, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, And the other, the minus 12 basis points, all of this was attributable to the cost of the COVID-19 of $53 million of the $212 million total amount previously mentioned. These are the direct costs for incremental wages allocated to our manufacturing, production and fulfillment operations. All told, even with the $53 million of COVID costs hitting the margin, Q4 year-over-year gross margin on a reported basis ex gas is still up 30 basis points year over year. Moving to SG&A., COVID costs, gross margin, SG&A, direct costs, wages, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our reported SG&A in the first quarter as a percent of sales was lower or better year over year by 15 basis points, coming in at 10.15% of sales compared to a year earlier -- first quarter of 10.30%. And ex gas deflation, the 15 basis improvement would be 32 basis points of improvement. Again, jotting down two columns of numbers, reported and without gas deflation.

And summing those two columns up, total reported SG&A year over year was better or lower -- or better, plus 15 basis points; and ex gas deflation, plus 32 basis points. Now SG&A in the core -- again, it shows, ex deflation, an improvement of 62 basis points. This excludes the COVID costs, which I\\'ll talk about in a minute., central, stock compensation, other, SG&A, core, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, There was significant -- just basic significant leverage with strong core merchandise sales increases. In terms of other, the minus 38 or minus 37-basis-point number ex deflation -- gas deflation, these were our incremental costs from the COVID-19, $159 million of the $212 million total number that we had mentioned earlier. The premium wages have been extended through January 3 at this time. Again, even including these $159 million of COVID-related premium pay expenses, SG&A year over year improved nicely., significant leverage, core merchandise sales, other (COVID costs), SG&A, premium wages, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement is preopening expense, $22 million this year in the first quarter, compared to $14 million a year earlier. We had 10 openings, eight net of two relocations during the quarter; and four openings gross, three net of one relocation a year earlier. Last year\\'s $14 million number did include a couple of million dollars related to preopening on our new poultry -- on our poultry complex, which was opened and went into business right before the beginning of Q1. All told, reported operating income for Q1 \\'21 increased 35%, coming in at $1.43 billion this year, compared to $1.061 billion last year, and even a higher percent increase, of course., Preopening expenses, Store openings, Operating income, Revenue increase, Poultry\\ncomplex, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, It would have been higher had not we had those -- the premium pay. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $39 million this year versus $38 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $6 million year over year. Interest income itself with net interest income and other was lower by $22 million year over year due in large part to lower interest rates, offset by FX and other, which was up -- which was higher or better by $16 million year over year., Premium pay, Interest expense, Interest income, Other income, FX and other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, So overall, reported pre-tax income in Q1 \\'21 was up 34%, coming in at $1.42 billion this year, compared to $1.058 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal \\'21 was 16.8%, compared to 19.1% in Q1 last year. Both years\\' tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier.

As people are spending less on air and travel and hotel and dining out, they seem to have redirected some of those dollars to categories like electronics, furniture and mattresses, exercise equipment, housewares, cookware, domestics, etc. And as mentioned earlier, sales in most of our ancillary businesses were lower year over year in the quarter, travel, gas, hearing aids and food courts., Strong sales, Food and sundries, Health and beauty aids, Fresh foods, Home\\nproducts, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2021, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, From a supply chain perspective, a 40,000-foot view, if you will. Most factories are up and running at our suppliers, and in many cases, production capacity has been increased. However, even higher increases in demand of some products are still creating some supply issues.

Examples would include things like exercise equipment, certain major appliances, certain electronics items, as well as certain housewares and small electric items. On the transportation front, there have been some container shortages at origin, as well as some congestion at destination ports here in the states.

As well in the past few weeks, there have been some challenges that you may have read about in the industry in terms of delayed delivery times of e-com item -- of items, just given the number of items being shipped now through third-party carriers. While this may reduce some sales if members are confident -- are not confident in timely holiday delivery, we, like others, I\\'m sure, have done a couple of things.

I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\\'s call, as well as, other risks identified from time to time in the company\\'s public statements and reports filed with the SEC., Forward-looking statements, Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\\nRisks and uncertainties, Events, results, and/or performance differences, SEC filings, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today\\'s press release, we reported operating results for the fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2020, the 16 and 52 weeks ended August 30th. Reported net income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share, compared to $1.097 billion or $2.47 a share -- per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter. This year\\'s fourth quarter was negatively impacted by incremental expense related to COVID-19 premium wages and sanitation costs totaling $281 million pre-tax or $0.47 a share, as well as, a $36 million pre-tax charge or $0.06 per share related to early payment of $1.5 billion of debt., Forward-looking statements, Operating results for Q4 and FY2020, Net income,\\nCOVID-19 expenses, Debt early payment charge, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, These items were partially offset by an $84 million pre-tax benefit or $0.15 a share for the partial reversal of a reserve of $123 million pre-tax, $0.22 per diluted share related to our product tax assessment taken in the fourth quarter of last year. Net sales for the quarter increased 12.5% to $52.28 billion, up from $46.45 billion in the fourth quarter a year earlier. For the fiscal year in its entirety, fiscal 2020 came in at $163.22 billion, a 9.3% increase over the $149.35 billion in fiscal 2019.

Traffic or shopping frequency on a worldwide basis was down 1.2% during the fourth quarter and showed an increase of 1.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction, our average basket size was up 12.7% during the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the negative impacts from gas deflation and FX, which are included in that number. We\\'ve kept you up-to-date in our monthly sales calls on the impacts from pandemic -- from the pandemic as we\\'ve been able to identify those., Sales impact of dollar and gasoline price deflation, Traffic or shopping\\nfrequency, Average transaction size, Average basket size, Pandemic impact, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Overall merchandise sales in the core, core being food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh, as well as, pharmacy have all been strong, while sales in our ancillary, other ancillary, and travel businesses, though now open, have been soft. Next, moving down the income statement, membership fee income. We reported a fourth-quarter membership fee income of $1.106 billion, up $56 million from $1.05 billion in the fourth quarter of \\'19. The $56 million increase ex FX would have been $60 million up., Merchandise sales, Membership fee income, Ancillary businesses, Other ancillary\\nbusinesses, Travel businesses, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, During the quarter, we opened eight net new units and 13 for the entire fiscal year. In terms of renewal rates, at fourth-quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate remained at 91% and worldwide rate also remained at its similar number from a quarter ago at 88.4%. In terms of the number of members at Q4 end, both member households and cardholders, total paid households at fourth quarter end was up -- was -- came in at 58.1 million and cardholders, 105.5 million., New store openings, Renewal rates, Member households, Cardholders, Total paid\\nhouseholds, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In the fourth quarter, we standardized the membership count methodology globally, which we\\'d apparently done differently in different markets, North America versus others, and so, that increase includes that slight adjustment. The change resulted in adding approximately 1.3 million paid members and 2.0 million cardholders to our member base. So as an example, from Q3 to Q4 when we showed going from 55.8 million to 58.1 million or up 2.3 million, that 2.3 million increase includes the 1.3 million adjustment upwards. Similarly, the 3.7 million increase from the end of third quarter to fourth quarter, that 3.7 million increase includes 2.0 million of an adjustment., Membership count methodology standardization, Paid members, Cardholders, Member\\nbase increase, Adjustments, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, I\\'d like to note, however, that neither the membership fee income dollars nor the renewal rate calculations were affected by this adjustment. At fourth-quarter end, paid executive memberships totaled 22.6 million, an increase of 765,000 during the 16 weeks since third-quarter end. Going down the gross margin line -- going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin came in at 11.24%, up 18 basis points from last year\\'s fourth-quarter gross margin of 11.06%. That 18-basis point increase, excluding gas deflation, came in what would have been minus 4 basis points, and excluding a portion of the direct COVID expenses would have been up 8%, and I\\'ll show you that in the numbers that I ask you to jot down here., Membership fee income, Renewal rate calculations, Paid executive memberships,\\nGross margin, Direct COVID expenses, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, If you jot down the following numbers, two columns. First column will be fourth quarter as reported. Second column will be fourth-quarter ex-gas deflation. The first line item would be core merchandise., Core merchandise, Fourth quarter as reported, Fourth quarter ex-gas deflation, Membership\\nfee income, Gross margin, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Year over year on a reported basis, core merchandise was up 101 basis points, ex-gas deflation, up 82 basis points, so plus 101 and plus 82 in the first line item. Ancillary businesses being the second line item reported, minus 66 basis points and without gas deflation, minus 71; 2% reward, minus four and minus 2 basis points; other, minus 13 and minus 13 basis points, and that would give you totals on a reported basis of plus 18 basis points, which I mentioned and ex-gas deflation, the minus four. Now the core merchandise component of gross margin again was higher by 101 basis points year over year and 82 basis points higher ex-gas deflation. Similar to last quarter and even more dramatic of an impact during this quarter, we had a significant sales shift from ancillary and other businesses to the core., Core merchandise, Ancillary businesses, Gross margin, Sales shift, Ex-gas deflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, This resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus last year. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation only -- to only their own sales, so core-on-core, if you will, margins year over year were up by 70 basis points. Fresh foods was the biggest driver of the year. With the strong sales in fresh, we benefited from efficiency gains in both labor productivity and significantly lower, what we call, D&D or damage and destroyed or products spoilage., Gross margin, core operations, merchandise categories, sales, efficiency gains, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Food and sundries, softlines, hardlines, as well, as I mentioned, fresh foods already. But in addition, food and sundries, softlines and hardlines, all had higher margins year over year in the quarter as well. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin again was lower by 66 basis points and 71 basis points ex-gas deflation. Most of the -- our ancillary businesses were lower year over year, with the most significant negative impact coming from gasoline and travel, which accounted for about three quarters of the decline., Food and sundries, softlines, hardlines, fresh foods, ancillary businesses, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Costco logistics, which was primarily our acquisition this past March of the big and bulkier last-mile carrier called Innovel, that was our newly acquired business. That impacted ancillary margins by minus 8 basis points. Again, we acquired this, this past March and we anticipated losses in this business as it ramps up. Not -- note that these losses do not take into account any added sales from extended product -- expanded product offerings, lower delivery prices, and improved member satisfaction., Costco logistics, Innovel, ancillary margins, sales, member satisfaction, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Next, 2% Reward, nothing really to say there, minus 2 basis points ex-gas deflation. And other, the minus 13 basis points, nearly all of this is attributable to the costs from COVID, $64 million of the $281 million previously mentioned. These are direct costs for incremental wages and sanitation allocated to our cost departments and to our merchandise fulfillment operations so it impacts cost of sales. Moving to SG&A., 2% Reward, COVID costs, cost of sales, SG&A, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Our reported SG&A percentage year over year was lower or better by 47 basis points, coming in at -- coming in at 9.62% of sales this year in the fourth quarter versus 10.09% last year in the fourth quarter. Ex-gas deflation, SG&A was lower or better by 66 basis points. Again, if you jot down the following two columns of numbers, first column is reported year-over-year SG&A change and the second column would be ex-gas deflation. Core operations as reported were better or lower by 42 basis points and ex-gas deflation, lower or better by 57 basis points., SG&A percentage, sales, gas deflation, core operations, ex-gas deflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, So plus 42 and plus 57; central, plus one and plus three; stock compensation, plus three and plus four; other, plus one and plus two. And that gives you the total on a reported basis SG&A being better by 47 basis points and ex-gas deflation being better by 66. SG&A in the core, excluding COVID-related expenses, which I\\'ll discuss in a moment, was significantly leveraged, of course, with a strong core merchandise sales increases. As I mentioned, central stock compensation showing small improvements year over year as a percent of sales and now the other plus one and -- plus 1-basis point reported and plus two ex-gas deflation., SG&A, core merchandise sales, COVID-related expenses, central stock compensation,\\nother, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, As I discussed earlier in the call, the quarter was positively impacted by an $84 million reversal of last year\\'s fourth quarter $123 million pre-tax reserve related to a product tax assessment taken a year ago in the fourth quarter. The net impact from this item was plus 43 basis points. That plus 43 basis points is in this plus one and plus 2-basis point number. Also included in other are the incremental COVID costs or $217 million of the $281 million total amount., Reversal of reserve, product tax assessment, COVID costs, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, That equates to 42 or 41 basis points without gas deflation, offsetting it the other way. So that\\'s why you have a very small number in that line. Again, these are the cost for incremental wages and safety and sanitation. Next on the income statement, preopening expense., Costs, gas deflation, preopening expenses, incremental wages, safety and\\nsanitation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Preopening expense last year in the fourth quarter was $41 million. This year in the fourth quarter, it was $15 million less, coming in at $26 million. Last year in the fourth quarter, we had 12 gross openings, 10 net, and two reloads, and that compares to 10 openings gross or eight net in the fourth quarter of this year. The big difference in those two numbers, this year\\'s fourth quarter relates primarily to warehouses opened during the quarter, as well as, warehouses scheduled to open in the first quarter., Preopening expense, gross openings, net openings, warehouses opened, warehouses\\nscheduled to open, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Last year\\'s preopening included $12 million in preopening expenses related to our new -- our then new poultry complex. All told, reported operating income in Q4 increased 32%, coming in at $1,929,000,000 this year, compared to $1,463,000,000 last year. And it would be a slightly higher percent increase if you excluded the items that I\\'d mentioned. Below the operating income line, interest expense was higher year over year by $6 million, coming in at $51 million this year, compared to $45 million last year., Preopening expenses, operating income, interest expense, percent increase,\\nexcluded items, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $83 million year over year. As discussed earlier, following the completion of the debt offering, we prepaid $1.5 billion of debt during the quarter. There was a pre-tax expense of -- or what\\'s known as a make-whole payment of $36 million related to the early retirement of that debt. That\\'s in this interest income and other line., Interest income, other, debt offering, pre-tax expense, make-whole payment, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Actual interest income was lower by $28 million lower -- it was actually lower by $28 million year over year in the quarter due principally to lower interest rates being realized. And lastly, FX and other was lower by $19 million. Overall, reported pre-tax income in the fourth quarter was up -- came in higher by 25%, coming in at $1.869 billion this year, compared to $1.492 billion last year. Again, these exclude those items I point -- that\\'s including those items I pointed out earlier., Actual interest income, pre-tax income, FX and other, reported pre-tax income,\\nexcluded items, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of the income tax rate, our tax rate in Q4 of \\'20 was 24.9%, a little lower than a year ago when it was at 25.7% in the fourth quarter a year ago, so a little benefit there. A few other items of -- a few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion with COVID, we had some delays in some of the planned openings for the fiscal year that just ended this past August 30th and a few of those have been pushed into this year that we\\'re in now. In the -- for the year, we opened 16 total units, including three reloads., Income tax rate, warehouse expansion, planned openings, fiscal year, COVID, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, So last year, we opened a net increase of 13 locations. Our plan for this year is to open about 20 net, 23, including three reloads, that\\'s our best guess and plan at this point. And as of Q4 end, our total warehouse square footage stood at 116 million square feet. In terms of capital expenditures, for the 16-week fourth quarter, we spent approximately a hundred -- $852 million, and the full year, we spent $2.8 billion., Net increase, total warehouse square footage, capital expenditures, full year, Q4\\nend, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Our estimated capex for all of fiscal \\'21 is in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range. E-commerce. Overall, our e-commerce sales, as you\\'ve seen each month have increased nicely for the fourth quarter on a reported basis, up 90.6%, and ex FX, 91.3% increase during the fourth quarter.

This e-commerce comp, if you will, that number\\'s -- the e-commerce numbers I just mentioned above follow our usual convention, which we exclude the third-party same-day grocery program. If we included that third-party same-day, our e-commerce comps result would have been approximately 120% up during the quarter. Overall, our e-comm sites were relatively smoothly during the quarter despite the dramatic volume increases and we were able to improve our delivery times throughout -- on delivery times throughout the quarter as we adjusted to the ramped-up order volumes., Total online grocery, e-commerce comp, third-party same-day grocery program,\\ndelivery times, e-comm sites, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Now quickly turning to COVID and the coronavirus, and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective, as indicated by our past three monthly sales releases, we\\'ve enjoyed strong sales results during the June, July, and August time frame. Certainly, the sales strength starts with our being deemed essential, resulting in strong sales of fresh foods and foods and sundries, and health and beauty aids, and the like. We\\'ve also benefited from the much improved sales and products and items for the home outside of the food area., COVID, coronavirus, sales perspective, essential items, home goods, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, As people are spending less on travel, air and hotel and dining out, they seem to have redirected at least some of those dollars to categories like lawn and garden, furniture and mattresses, exercise equipment, bicycles, housewares, cookware, domestics, and the like. And lastly, a few of our ancillary businesses, notably our optical and hearing aid operations, were closed for 12 to 16 weeks and reopened during the mid-summer. From a supply chain perspective, kind of a 40,000-foot view, in terms of China, at least judging by the shipments to us, most of the factories are up and running. There are still some production challenges due to certain components downstream in the supply chain in areas like electronics, computer, and certain white goods., Redirection of spending, categories, ancillary businesses, supply chain, China, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, It is getting better and improving each week. And like us, we feel that our suppliers\\' factories have gotten a bit better over the last several months of instituting safety protocols. That\\'s our best guess. And in terms of getting back to normal, each week is showing improvement and catching up, still a little behind., Getting better, improving, safety protocols, normal, weeks, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, Food and sundries, some limits on paper goods but getting better. Toughest area overall is still sanitizing wipes, as well as, latex gloves. In terms of other PP&E, we\\'re in pretty good shape, selling quite a bit of masks and the like. Milk and butter, things like that are generally OK., Food and sundries, paper goods, sanitizing wipes, latex gloves, PP&E, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 4, Richard Galanti, Director, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of fresh foods, proteins are all -- are currently all pretty good. There had been some slowdowns over the past few months and some allocations and some limits that we had to put on some sales of those items, but that\\'s gotten back to normal at this point. Seafood and produce, all good as it has generally been throughout.

And Costco travel has shown some very modest improvement, but still significantly impacted during the quarter due to reduced demand. We do see our members starting to book travel again, although generally further out than we have historically seen.

Reported net income for the quarter came in at $838 million or $1.89 per diluted share. This compared to $906 million or $2.05 per diluted share last year in the third quarter. Now, this year\\'s third quarter was negatively impacted by direct expenses of $283 million pre-tax or $0.47 per diluted share, from incremental wage safety and sanitation costs related to COVID-19. And last year\\'s third quarter number of $2.05 included the benefit from a non-recurring tax item of $73 million or $0.16 per diluted share., Operating results, net income, direct expenses, wage safety and sanitation costs,\\nnon-recurring tax item, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Net sales for the quarter increased 7.3% to $36.45 billion, up from $33.96 billion last year in the third quarter. On a same-store or comparable sales basis for the third quarter, for the 12 weeks on a reported basis, the US was a 5.9%, excluding gas deflation and FX impact, the 5.9% would have been for the 12 weeks at 8%. Canada, on a reported basis was minus 2.5%, ex-gas deflation and FX plus 3%. Other international came in on a reported basis at 6.2% and again ex-gas deflation and FX plus 12.2%. All told, the total company came in with a reported 4.8% and again ex-gas deflation and FX. The 4.8% would have been 7.8%., Net sales, same-store sales, US, Canada, other international, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, I might also note that e-commerce on a reported basis was 64.5% comp and ex-gas deflation or ex-FX 66.1%. Now foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 110 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 190 basis points for the total company therefore to 300 basis points. Additionally, gasoline volumes or gallons were down about 20% year-over-year in the quarter as a result of less driving due to the pandemic. These adjusted figures -- the impact of gasoline gallons is not in the adjusted figures that I just described above., E-commerce, reported basis, foreign currencies, gasoline price deflation, gasoline\\nvolumes, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of traffic, our shopping frequency or shopping frequency decreased in the quarter, worldwide by 4.1% and in the US by 2%. Our average transaction or ticket was up 9.3% during the third quarter and 9.3% does include the negative impacts from gas deflation and FX. Now our third quarter comp sales figures did reflect also that a few of our businesses, notably optical hearing aids, and photo, were closed for much of Q3 and a good portion of our food court item offerings were eliminated, also for much of Q3 as well, we eliminated the food court seeding during this time. Re-openings of these began -- stores begin on April 30, 10 days prior to the third quarter end, with about 20% of the locations best operating by Q3 end. In the past two weeks to three weeks, nearly all will be back in operation by mid-June. In terms of the food courts, which have been open, but again a much more limited menu, we\\'ve added some but not all the items back, as of now. In all an estimated hit to the reported sales numbers that we gave you earlier in Q3 by one to two percentage points by those items being closed or restricted., Traffic, shopping frequency, transaction size, business closures, food court\\nofferings, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement, membership fee income reported came in at $815 million or 2.24%, up 5% or $39 million for $776 million or 2.9% last year in Q3. Ex-FX weakness the $39 million increase and 5% increase would have been up $47 million or 6%. During the quarter, we had two new openings, a total of four year-to-date. In terms of renewal rates, at Q3 end, our US and Canada renewal rate came in at 91%, a tick up from where we were at Q2 end and the worldwide rate came in at 88.4%, the same as it was a fiscal quarter ago. Keep in mind that any impact on renewal rates from COVID, positive or negative, are reflected over the next several months., Membership fee income, ex-FX weakness, renewal rates, new openings, worldwide\\nrate, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of the number of members at Q3 end, member households and cardholders, in terms of households we ended the third quarter with 55.8 million households, up from 55.3 million 12 weeks earlier and total cardholders came in at 101.8 million, up from 100.9 million, 12 weeks earlier. At Q3 end, paid executive memberships came in at $21.8 million, an increase of $135,000 over the last 12 weeks., Member households, cardholders, paid executive memberships, membership growth, Q3\\nend figures, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Going down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year by 54 basis points on a reported basis, coming in at 11.53% up from 10.99%. Now the 54 basis point, ex-gas deflation, would have been plus 33 basis points. As I usually do, I should try to write down a few numbers in two columns and then we\\'ll go through that explanation. In terms of reported, in Q3 \\'20 year-over-year, the core merchandise was up 51 basis points on a reported basis and without gas deflation, up 33 basis points. Ancillary businesses was on a reported basis, plus 26 basis points, ex-gas deflation plus 21 basis points, the 2% reward minus 6 basis points and minus 4 basis points. Other minus 17 basis points and minus 17 basis points. And you add up those two columns, total reported, again up 54 basis points on a reported basis and up 33 basis points. The gross margin was up 33 basis points, ex-gas deflation., Gross margin, reported basis, core merchandise, ancillary businesses, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Now the core merchandise component of gross margin, again higher by 51 basis points or 33 basis points, ex deflation. Keep in mind that in the quarter, we had a decent sales shift from ancillary and other businesses to core businesses, which resulted in higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core., Core merchandise, ancillary businesses, other businesses, sales shift, gross\\nmargin contribution, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own sales or what we call core on core, margins year-over-year were lower by 17 basis points, 5 basis points by the way of which was the losses related to our new poultry complex. This is something I\\'ve pointed out in the last two quarters and will probably do so next quarter as well. In total, pretty similar in fact year-over-year impact in Q2. So while higher penetration of our total sales came from the core this year, it was at a slightly lower gross margin percentage year-over-year. This is mostly attributed to sales mix both between and within merchandise categories., Core merchandise categories, margins, sales mix, gross margin percentage, new\\npoultry complex, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Our fresh foods gross margin percentage was up again despite any first year headwinds from the -- from the ramp-up costs associated with the poultry complex. The strength in fresh was a result of high sales driving down our spoilage, as well as labor costs as a percent of sales being able to leverage those at a greater than normal rate. Soft lines, food and sundries, and hardlines, all had lower margin percentage year-over-year in the quarter. One example non-foods, which is both hardlines and softlines, non-foods was impacted by shift in sales toward lower margin departments, particularly things like majors and big ticket electronics., Fresh foods gross margin, ramp-up costs, spoilage, labor costs, sales mix, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Ancillary and other business gross margin in the two columns, higher by 26 basis points, again 21 higher basis points ex gas deflation. This result was primarily due to strength in gas and e-com gross margin dollars year-over-year, partially offset by a lower penetration of ancillary sales, due to lower gas prices and volumes and the closures of some of those ancillary businesses that I talked about earlier, several of those businesses have higher gross margins. 2% reward was higher or was hit to gross margin by 6 basis points on a reported basis and 4 basis points, ex deflation implying that slightly higher percentage of our sales were eligible for the executive member reward., Ancillary and other business gross margin, gas and e-com gross margin dollars,\\npenetration of ancillary sales, 2% reward, closures of ancillary businesses, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, The other line item, 17 basis points to the negative, 12 basis points of the 17 basis points is attributable to the COVID costs and the 12 basis points, that\\'s about $44 million of the $283 million number that was mentioned in the press release. These are the costs for incremental wages, safety, and sanitation across, allocated to our cost departments and merchandise fulfillment operations. So I\\'ll just say it hits the margin. The other 5 basis points or $19.7 million came from accruing reserve for certain third-party gift cards and ticket programs. This latter $19.7 million was not included in the $283 million total amount that we called out as a direct incremental expenses from COVID., COVID costs, wages, safety, sanitation, gift cards and ticket programs, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Moving to SG&A, our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was higher by 59 basis points, coming in at 10.51% of sales, up from 9.92%; ex-gas deflation the minus 59 basis points would have been minus 40 basis points or higher by 40 basis point. If you can please jot down the following SG&A components and then we\\'ll go through that. Core operations reported was plus 9 basis points or lower by 9 basis points, benefit of 9 basis points; ex-gas deflation plus 24 basis points or benefit of 24 basis points. Central, zero basis points and plus 2 basis points; stock compensation plus 3 basis points and plus 3 basis points; other minus 71 basis points and minus 69 basis points and you add up those two columns, you get to the reported SG&A increase of 59 basis points and ex-gas and FX -- ex-gas deflation rather, minus 40 -- higher by 40 basis points., SG&A components, core operations, central, stock compensation, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Now again, the core operations component lower by 9 basis points and ex-gas deflation lower by 24 basis points. SG&A in the core operations excluding, that\\'s excluding the COVID related expenses that I\\'ll talk about in a minute, they were -- needless to say leverage with strong core merchandise sales. Central was essentially flat and a slight improvement relative including ex gas deflation. Stock comp, no surprises there, a slight benefit to SG&A by 3 basis points and again the other component of 71 basis points or 69 ex-gas deflation under 71 basis points, 66 basis points of the 71 basis points is attributable to the incremental cost of COVID-19 or $239 million of that $283 million total amount that was in the press release. Again, these are the cost for incremental wages and safety and sanitation related direct expenses. The balance of the 71 basis point figure was 5 basis points or $18.5 million, this came from the cost associated with the acquisition and integration-related expenses of our recent acquisition of Innovel, that last mile delivery and installation operation for $1 billion that we acquired a few months ago., Core operations, SG&A, COVID-19 expenses, acquisition and integration-related\\nexpenses, Innovel, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense was lower by $6 million coming in at $8 million in the quarter versus $14 million a year ago. Again we had two openings this year. Last year in the quarter, we had three although chunks of these --each of these numbers relate to a pending openings in Q4 as well. All told, reported operating income in the 3rd quarter of 2020 increased by 5.1% coming in at $1.179 billion compared to $1.122 billion a year ago. Now this 5% increase is notwithstanding the incremental costs that we talked about -- that I just talked about the $283 million as well as the 19.7 [Phonetic] and the 18.5 [Phonetic] that I just mentioned as well. Those are all taken in the third quarter., Pre-opening expense, operating income, incremental costs, acquisition and\\nintegration-related expenses, pending openings, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Below the operating income line, interest expense was higher year-over-year by $2 million coming in at $37 million this year in the quarter versus $35 million a year ago. Recall that we completed a $4 billion debt offering on April 20, during the third quarter. Following the completion of the debt offering, we called the outstanding debt due May 20 -- May of 2021, that was a $1 billion tranche and additional $5 million tranche that was due in February of 2002, both of these tranches we\\'ve paid off this morning. After a 30 day call notice. There will be a pre-tax expense of $36 million related to the early retirement or make all of these, this debt, which will hit our Q4 results on the interest income and other line in our P&L., Interest expense, debt offering, debt retirement, early retirement, Q4 results, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement, interest income and other for the quarter it was lower by $15 million year-over-year mostly attributable to lower interest income and mostly attributed to lower interest rates within that. Overall reported pre-tax income in Q3 fiscal \\'20 was up 3.6% coming in at $1.163 billion versus $1.123 billion last year and again the $1.163 billion is after taking the impacts of those charges that I previously mentioned., Interest income and other, pre-tax income, reported income, charge impacts, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was -- this year was 26.7%, last year was 18.5% tax rate again last year it included a benefit of a non-recurring tax item of $73 million. A few other items of note, in terms of warehouse expansion, as I mentioned we opened two units in the third quarter. That puts us at five -- actually five units total through the first three quarters. We expect in Q4 to open 10 including two relos so net of eight. So it looks like our net total this year will be somewhere around 13. There has been a few that have been impacted by COVID-19 in terms of construction delays and have been pushed into the first part of fiscal \\'21 which starts in early September. As of Q3 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 115 million square feet., Tax rate, non-\\nrecurring tax item, warehouse expansion, COVID-19 impacts, total warehouse square footage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of capital expenditures, the third quarter of fiscal 2020 total spend was approximately $626 million and our estimated capex for all of fiscal \\'20 is currently in the $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion range. A slight decline from what we had estimated an estimated a quarter ago.

I might mention -- I should note that within that 61 [Phonetic]. Like many retailers out there, we saw an increasingly level of strength in e-commerce sales over the last few months. If I look at the 12 week -- the three, four week periods that comprise our 12 week third quarter, roughly that 66.1 -- or that 54.5% reported number in the first four weeks was in the 25% range. And the next four weeks in the 50% increased range and the most recent -- and the last four weeks in the 90% range. But totaling that 64.5% on a reported basis., E-commerce sales,\\nreported basis, ex-FX, strength, quarter periods, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, A few of the stronger departments health and beauty aids, office, majors, housewares and small electrics total online grocery grew at an incredible rate within the third, during the third quarter, as I\\'m sure did in many places. The comp numbers just mentioned again follow, that\\'s the 64% number, they follow our historical convention where we exclude our third party or same day grocery program, since that those that comes into the warehouse to be picked up by the third party and delivered to our member. If we were to exclude [Phonetic] that third-party in our e-commerce number that mid 60% comp number would be slightly over 100%. So we\\'ve seen big strength and driving the business that way. Overall, our e-com sites have worked pretty smoothly during the quarter despite dramatic, volume increases and as well, we\\'re able to improve on delivery times throughout the quarter as we adjusted to the ramped up order volumes., Stronger departments, online grocery growth, historical convention, smooth e-commerce, delivery\\ntime improvements, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Now turning to the coronavirus and all the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective, as discussed last quarter and indicated by our monthly sales results that we do, we started Q3 strong, I think it started actually in the fourth week of February then into the first 2.5 weeks of March, with very strong sales as people were stocking up prior to the implementation, the concern about availability of certain key products as well as the implementation of various stay at home orders. The middle of the quarter was -- it was weaker as many of the geographies in which we operate had issued mandates limiting movement as well we have implemented our own restrictions during these times. Recently, our sales have started to recover somewhat as states have begun to relax restrictions., Coronavirus impacts, sales perspective, monthly sales results, geographies, recovery, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Within the merchandise categories foods, fresh and other essentials have been very strong, despite out of stocks on some items throughout the quarter, such as toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies, etc. meats and proteins toward the end of the quarter, hand sanitizers and the like. Office and majors were also strong during the quarter driven by work from home initiatives well, most of the other discretionary categories were a little weaker during the quarter, such as jewelry, luggage, third-party gift cards they were generally weak. Other weak categories, which include things like sporting goods, lawn and garden, patio and apparel, while they were weak, they have rebounded somewhat toward the end of the quarter., Food, Essentials, Out-of-Stocks, Work-from-Home, Discretionary Categories, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, From a supply chain perspective, I\\'m going to give you a 40,000 preview of that. On the non-food side as it relates to imports from China, most of the factories are now up and running, other major country suppliers, India for textiles and domestics, Mexico primarily for things like TV assembly, a few weeks behind China in terms of getting back to normal, but each week is showing improvement. On the foods and sundries sides, paper goods still on allocation and idle limits on certain items in certain regions. Sporadic limited -- Sporadic limited limits on canned foods items like tuna and chicken. Toughest areas again are still hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes, and Lysol sprays and the like. Items like milk and butter are generally OK. And we\\'ve also -- we have eliminated like frozen -- certain host frozen proteins like chicken and beef items., Supply Chain, Imports, China, India, Mexico, Paper Goods, Food, Hand Sanitizers, Disinfecting\\nWipes, Lysol Sprays, Frozen Proteins, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of fresh, the protein side, the merchandise is there but challenging from a production and processing side. Currently for us pork is the least affected, but somewhat affected but what we\\'ve done over the last couple of three weeks I believe on fresh beef, chicken, and pork items. Those protein items we limit. Three fresh items in total. We also have limits on a per SKU on certain frozen items like 10 pounds of hamburger patties or chicken breast or the like., Fresh, Protein, Production, Processing, Limits, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of seafood and produce that\\'s all good.

A great increase in use in demand of those items continued, but we expect continued improvement generally each week., Seafood, Produce, Hand Sanitizer, Demand, Improvement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, And then lastly, Costco Travel it was let\\'s say significantly impacted during the quarter due to reduced demand as well as cancellations of previous booked trips. Members are now starting to actually book travel again although generally further out than we have historically seen. And of course we book those results when the trips or activities occur. Warehouses have overall remained open. Although we did operate reduced hours at most of our US locations for several weeks during the quarter. Regular hours resumed May 4 with an additional hour on weekday mornings for seniors and persons with disabilities. Warehouses are still following social distancing and sanitation guidelines. Additionally, as discussed some of our warehouse businesses like hearing aid, optical, and photo and to a partial extent the food courts were closed or mitigated during the majority of the quarter. Also effective May 4, we now require all our members and employees in the warehouses to wear masks. During the quarter included in that, again that big $283 million number, we spent about $32 million on masks, gloves and incremental cleaning and cleaning supplies and things like Plexiglass partitions and you name it are related to COVID, but that\\'s in that $283 million number. Some of the initiatives, some of the initiatives related to $283 million and cost will extend into Q4. We would expect the incremental expenses related to COVID -- these types of expenses related to COVID to exceed $100 million in Q4, but be quite a bit lower than the $283 million that we had in Q3, we\\'ll have to just wait and see though., Costco Travel, Demand, Bookings, Warehouse Hours, Masks, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finally, in terms of upcoming releases.

In terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, second quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.9% worldwide, and 6.1% in the US.

Going down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was lower year-over-year by 31 basis points coming in at 10.98% compared to 11.29% a year ago.

Within the core gross margin year-over-year in Q2, we showed a gross margin increase in soft lines. Food and sundries was about even year-over-year and decreases in both hard lines and fresh foods.

Basically, you had a few things that hurt you and a few things that helped you. But overall, minus 2 ex-gas inflation. 2% reward was better by 4 basis points on a reported basis and by 2 basis points ex-gas inflation. This relates primarily to a true-up of our breakage estimate of the Executive Member rewards., Ancillary Businesses, Gross Margins, Gas Inflation, Reward Program, Breakage\\nEstimate, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Moving to SG&A, our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was lower or better by 22 basis points coming in at 9.78% of sales, down from 10% a year earlier. Without gas inflation, SG&A was lower by 13 basis points. Again if you jot down the following few numbers four line items in the two columns. Operation -- core operations, year-over-year in Q2 on a reported basis showed an improvement. It was lower, so I\\'d say a plus 17 basis points and ex-gas inflation plus 10. Central plus 1 basis point, and plus 0 basis point, stock compensation was lower or plus 4 basis points and plus 3 basis points on ex-gas inflation. And again, the total on a reported basis, SG&A was lower by 22 basis points, plus 22 basis points, and without gas inflation, a plus 13 basis points, so lower by 13 basis points., SG&A Percentage, Core Operations, Gas Inflation, Stock Compensation, Total, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The core operations component again 17 basis points reported, 10 basis points excluding impacts of gas. This figure includes the impact of the wage increases that occurred last March of \\'19. This hit our year-over-year comparison by an estimated 3 basis points to 4 basis points. We anniversaried that increase just this past week, so the impact in Q3 will be minimal. SG&A also benefited during Q2 year-over-year, from the shift of sales penetration to lower SG&A -- if you will, lower SG&A segments of our operations, which are growing at a faster rate than the core, again gas and e-comm., Core Operations, Gas Inflation, Wage Increases, SG&A Segments, Sales Penetration, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Central was lower -- within SG&A, central was lower on a reported basis by 1 basis point or flat year-over-year ex-gas inflation. We continue to invest and spend in IT to the tune of about 5 basis points higher year-over-year. That -- it was offset by improvement in other expense items and of course, helped by strong sales. And stock comp, as I mentioned on ex-gas inflation improvement of 3 basis points. This varies quarter-to-quarter. Looking at the last couple of years, generally it\\'s a small hit in Q1 and flat to a small benefit in the other quarters, nothing really unusual to report there., Central, IT Expenses, Other Expense Items, Stock Compensation, Sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Preopening expense was lower, came in at $7 million compared to $2 million in Q2 a year-ago. As I mentioned earlier, this year, we had no openings, last year we had two openings, both in the US. One net new opening and one relo. This year\\'s Q2 preopening expense in this quarter relates primarily to warehouse that we will open during the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Coming up very soon, our opening in Perth, Australia, and also our first in the State of Mississippi, in Ridgeland, Mississippi. That will be our 45th state where we operate. Those will be both opened during the next couple of weeks., Preopening Expense, Openings, Warehouse, States, Australia, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, All told, reported operating income in the second quarter of 2020 increased by 5.2% coming in at $1.266 billion this year, compared to $1.203 billion a year ago.

In the second quarter, it was -- it came in at a 25.9% rate, compared to 25.8% in Q2 last year. For all of fiscal 2020 based on our current estimates, which of course are subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate to be approximately 26% to 26.5%. In terms of openings, as I mentioned, we had no openings in Q2.

Again a lot of that had to do -- a lot of that increase had to do with the Thanksgiving shift. We estimated in the end at about 11 percentage points of that related to Thanksgiving following a week later this year and helping this number. Overall, a few of the stronger departments, majors, special order kiosk items, seasonal and toys and housewares.

The February results benefited by last week\\'s big uptick in sales, the fourth week of last month, mostly we believe related to the concerns around the coronavirus. This positively impacted the month\\'s total and comparable sales numbers by approximately 3 percentage points. US regions, with the strong sales results in February -- in February were the North West Texas and the Midwest. Internationally in local currencies, we saw strong results in Taiwan, Japan, Spain and Mexico.

Gas price inflation, I think I mentioned this positively impacted total reported comp sales by about 60 basis points. Lastly, our comp traffic or frequency for February was up 9.2% worldwide, and 8.9% in the US. Now, given the impact in week 4 where we really saw the big uptick as I know many did out there, it was related to the concerns over the coronavirus. The first three weeks within that 9.2% worldwide for four weeks. The first 3 weeks stood at 7.6% and again within the 8.9% US frequency number for the four weeks, within that for the three weeks, it was 6.9%. So still a good showing prior to that.

We\\'re getting deliveries daily. But it\\'s still not enough given the increased levels of demand on certain key items. It\\'s been a little crazy this past week in terms of outside shopping frequency and sales levels, and not only in the United States. In terms of placing quantity limits on what a member can purchase, we are doing that in some instances. It tends to be at all locations, but may differ regionally based on supply levels.

Overall in terms of what the coronavirus related demand items in terms of that is looking better, but not perfect, and we will see what each day brings. At our warehouses, in terms of cleanliness and sanitizing, we have enhanced sanitizing protocols and safety procedures have been implemented all the locations. Some examples, wiping downtrodden handles with sanitizing wipes, placing of sanitizing wipes stands at entrances, also along the fresh line wall and food courts, enhanced procedures at the food courts, patio tables, condiment tables, dispensers and beds, etc, the general things you might expect in that we see in all the recommendations., Suppliers, Demand Items, Warehouse Cleanliness and Safety Procedures, Geographical\\nDifferences, Supply Chain Relationships, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of supply chain, closures of many manufacturing facilities extended well beyond the typical one week Chinese New Year holiday, which was the last week in January.

Initially two to three weeks of factory -- so initially there are two to three weeks of factory closures not one. Then about three weeks ago and just pulling some of the buyers that -- a deal with the factories they felt there was a rough number of 20% to 25% production levels, moving up to 40% and now as high as 60% to 80%.

Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales core-on-core, if you will, margins year-over-year were higher by 4 basis points. Subcategories within the core margins year-over-year in Q1 showed increases in hardlines, softlines and food and sundries and a decrease in fresh foods, nearly all of that decrease in fresh foods was the result of the initial operating losses from our new poultry complex. That will be a small headwind throughout the year.

This figure includes the impact from the wage increases that we\\'ve talked about in the last couple of quarters that occurred -- this impact relates to the wage increases that occurred in March of 2019, which hit the year-over-year comparison by 3 to 4 basis points in the quarter. As mentioned previously, we would expect a similar impact that will occur in Q2 before we anniversary that wage increase midway through Q3. Central was higher again by 4 basis points year-over-year, IT was the biggest driver of the increase as we continued not only to maintain and upgrade but expand our capabilities and activities, and certainly, we have a lot going on there. And stock comp again minus 4 basis points a hit there, that hit you usually is in Q1 year-over-year based on the fact that we grant our issues in that quarter and how we do things for employees 25, 30 and 35 years out., Wage Increases, Core Business, Central, IT, Stock Comp, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2020, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, On the income statement.

In terms of e-commerce, our overall e-commerce sales on a reported basis in the quarter was a 5.5%, as I mentioned earlier, and again ex-FX 5.7%. Again, those numbers you could add 12 -- roughly 12 percentage points to each of those to account for our estimate of the impact of the holiday shift.

Weakening foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by about 60 basis points. Gas price deflation was a negative 50 basis points and rev rec benefited comp sales in the quarter by a plus 110 basis points. So those three things together essentially zeroed out.

In the fourth quarter, you have two columns, both reported and then without gas deflation and rev rec. The line items would be -- the first line item would be merchandise, core merchandise. On a reported basis, the year-over-year was down 8 basis points. Ex gas and rev rec, it was down 3 basis points. Ancillary businesses, up 29 basis points and ex those items, up 31 basis points year-over-year. 2% reward, minus 3 basis points and minus 4 basis points.

Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to our own sales or what we call core-on-core, margins year-over-year were higher by 4 basis points., Core Merchandise, Gross Margin, Basis Points, Core-on-Core Sales, Year-Over-Year\\nComparison, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 4, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Subcategories within that, the year-over-year and the fourth quarter showed increases in fresh and softlines, partially offset by a little down year-over-year in hardlines with food and sundries being relatively flat year-over-year. Ancillary and other business as mentioned was higher by 29 basis points and 31 basis points higher ex gas and rev rec. Most of that was attributable to strong gasoline margins. Other was minus 4 basis points in both columns., Fresh and Softlines, Hardlines, Ancillary and Other Business, Gasoline Margins, Year-\\nOver-Year Comparison, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 4, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Moving to SG&A, I\\'ll ask you to jot down the following. Again, two columns, reported and ex deflation -- gas deflation and rev rec. Operations, plus 3 basis points and minus 2 basis points, so minus 2 basis points meaning it\\'s higher by 2 basis points; central, minus 5 basis points and minus 5 basis points or higher by 5 basis points. Stock compensation, plus 2 basis points and plus 2 basis points, so lower by 2 basis points year-over-year; and then other, minus 27 basis points and minus 27 basis points. And with that, you would get to the -- our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year being higher or worse by 27 basis points coming in at 10.09%; sales, up from 9.82% of sales a year ago. Again, excluding the one-time items discussed earlier, the SG&A would have been flat year-over-year on a reported basis and ex gas and rev rec, higher by 5 basis points., Operations, Central, Stock Compensation, Other, SG&A Percentage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 4, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Now in terms of the components here, the core operations component excluding the impacts of gas and rev rec again was 2 basis points higher. This figure included the impact of the two wage increases that were taken in June of \\'18 and March of \\'19, which essentially hit the year-over-year comparison by an estimated 5 basis points to 6 basis points in the quarter.

Pre-opening expense for the fourth quarter came in at $41 million, $10 million higher than the $31 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This year in the fourth quarter, we opened 12 -- we had 12 total openings, 10 net plus two relos. Our total pre-opening was up year-over-year primarily due to the pre-opening costs related to our chicken plant in Nebraska.

In terms of number of members, at Q3-end, the number of member households we had was 53.1 million at Q3-end, that\\'s up from 52.7 million 12 weeks earlier.

Now, excluding the items that I\\'ve excluded before, FX, rev rec and like, the 6 basis points lower number would be actually plus 5 basis points, excluding gas inflation and rev rec., Gross margin, Year-over-year change, Excluding items, Q3 end, Gas inflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director, Financially, to jot down a couple of numbers here. Two columns, both reported and then ex gas inflation and revenue recognition for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to a year earlier, the first line item here would be core merchandise. On a reported basis year-over-year in the quarter it was reported 1 basis point lower. Ex gas and rev rec, it was 9 basis points positive. Ancillary businesses, minus 3 and minus 1 basis points; 2% reward, minus 2 and minus 3, and summing all those up, you have the reported number 6 basis points lower and ex gas and rev rec, 5 basis points to that higher., Core merchandise, Ancillary businesses, Reward program, Reported vs excluding\\nitems, Q3 end, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director, One thing I will note compared to last -- the second quarter, in the second quarter we had a big increase in ancillary business margin as we pointed out last quarter\\'s earnings release. The core merchandise component here, again, lower by 1 basis point. If you look at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, core on core, if you will, margins year-over-year were higher in Q3 year-over-year by 21 basis points., Ancillary business margin, Core merchandise margin, Sales growth, Q3 end, Year-\\nover-year change, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director, The sub categories within the core, all four main subcategories, food, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods were all up year-over-year in the third quarter on their own sales and that\\'s a trend that we\\'ve seen last quarter. It was up less than that amount in Q1, down a little bit year-over-year. Ancillary, the other business gross margin again lower by 1 basis point on the ex-gas and rev rec, nothing really to speak of in terms of things there., Core categories, Subcategories, Year-over-year growth, Ancillary business margin,\\nQ3 end, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director, Moving to SG&A, our SG&A percentage Q3 over Q3 was lower or better by 6 basis points coming in at 9.92% of sales this year.

Again, to jot down a few numbers here, the two columns, reported and the second column without gas inflation and rev rec -- gas inflation or rev rec, our core operations on a reported basis was better by 7 basis points, so plus 7; ex rev rec, minus 2. Central, minus 1 and minus 2 basis points.

Both of these wage increases negatively impacted SG&A during the quarter, represented about 10 to 12 basis points of the year-over-year variance., Wage increases, SG&A variance, Q3 end, Year-over-year change, Excluding items, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director, In Q4, the estimated impact will be about minus 5 to 6 basis points, which is the residual impact from June of \\'18 plus the March 2019 increases and then we\\'ll take down to 3 or 4 basis points detriment we estimate in Q1 of 2020.

In Qs one through three, and the first 36 weeks of this year, we will open a total of 10 new locations, in Q4 we have 11 planned. So there is some remnants of beginning of sort of the preopening there. All told, reported operating income in Q3 was up 5%, coming in at $1.122 billion this year compared to $1.067 billion last year. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was $2 million lower or better year-over-year, coming in at $35 million versus $37 million.

I\\'m sure we\\'ll be getting some questions on that. So a few comments. As we indicated a couple of quarters ago on our earnings release, there continue to be a lot of moving parts, although some of the moving parts are getting bigger. And it is still -- but it is still pretty fluent. The actions that we took then and we continue to take where we were able to, not in a big way, we\\'re accelerating shipments before certain tariffs would go into effect or would be increased in the percentage of the tariff. Although there is limited ability to do that, we\\'ve worked with suppliers. We\\'ve gone to potentially to every supplier on every item as you might expect to see what we can do both reduce costs and figure out how to do that., Tariffs, Moving parts, Shipments, Suppliers, Cost reduction, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director, In some cases, we\\'ve reduced order commitments on certain items.

And we\\'ve taken advantage of lower pricing on certain US items that impacted the other way., Tariffs, Order commitments, Country sourcing, Pricing, Cost reduction, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director, In summary, we will continue to see our customers, competitors react to this. What\\'s interesting is if you -- as you know, this List 3, which is the biggest of the three Lists of potential tariffs items, those were listed back in September of \\'18 at 10% tariffs and we\\'re willing going to go to 25% at December -- as of December 31st of 2018. That data has continued to move, although it\\'s now moved and it\\'s in fact that 25% for items that I believe are -- that are on -- that are exported after May 10. So we\\'re just starting to see some of those impacts., Tariffs, List 3, Export restrictions, Impacts, December deadline, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 3, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director, As you might expect, it\\'s all over the Board in terms of every item and every vendor is different. In some cases, it\\'s being passed on. In some cases, we\\'re able to work to figure out how to move merchandise. And then the impact of when the price increase does go through, it has a different impact of how it affects sales. We think that we\\'re in a good position in terms of our size and our ability and our relationships with our vendors and we\\'ll keep you posted how it goes.

We\\'re now nearing the end of that 23-month cycle to recognize the incremental benefit of the fee increases, what is known as deferred accounting, into our P&L. The benefit to our P&L will be fully recognized in the next two quarters, by the end of the fiscal year, but as with this last couple of quarters, it diminishes each quarter.

In the chart that I normally give out, there really is not a whole lot to tell you. Operations was an improvement of two basis points in both columns. The other two line items that we usually point out, central and stock compensation expense, were zero and zero. So, the total remained at two basis points.

As mentioned in the past couple of fiscal quarters, those wage increases negatively impacted SG&A by about 7-8 basis points during Q2 year-over-year. And it will continue to impact SG&A comparisons through Q3, which ends May 12th, and into the first month of our 16-week fiscal fourth quarter to anniversary on that June 11th., Wage increases, SG&A, Q2 year-over-year, Impact, Fiscal quarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Additionally, this past Monday, we began our new three-year employee agreement.

In addition, we\\'re also increasing wages for supervisors and also introduced paid bonding leave for all hourly employees. These items are incremental to the usual annual top-of-scale wage increases that are typically done each March. Collectively, these additional items will add about 3-4 basis points to SG&A over the next four quarters.

Pre-opening expenses were actually lower by $3 million, coming in this year at $9 million compared to $12 million last year. This year, again, we had two openings: one net opening and one relocation. Last year, we actually just had one opening. There\\'s other activities that relate to pre-opening as well. Year-over-year, primarily, the difference was due to the $4 million in Q2 last year related to our opening of our new meat plant in Morris, Illinois, slightly offset by higher warehouse pre-opening this year due to the additional opening., Pre-opening expenses, Net openings, Relocation, Other activities, Year-over-year, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, All told, reported operating income in Q2 \\'19 was up 18.4%, coming in at $1.203 billion this year compared to $1.016 million last year., Operating income, Q2 \\'19, Reported operating income, Up 18.4%, $1.203 billion, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was $3 million lower or better year-over-year, coming in at $34 million this year in Q2 as compared to $37 million last year. The actual interest expense quarter-over-quarter each year is about the same, a little delta and improvement in capitalized interest amounts., Reported interest expense, Lower or better, Q2 year-over-year, Actual interest expense,\\nCapitalized interest amounts, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Interest income and other for the quarter was better by $39 million year-over-year. Interest income itself was higher by $17 million year-over-year in the quarter, a combination of higher interest rates being realized and also higher invested cash balances. Also benefiting year-over-year comparison were the various FX items in the amount of $22 million. Recognize that much of this is essentially an offset to the lower reported operating income and earnings in our foreign operations due to the strength of the U.S. dollar versus many of the foreign currencies in the countries where we operate compared to last year., Interest income, Other, Year-over-year, Foreign operations, FX items, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Overall, pre-tax income in Q2 was up 23%, coming in at $1.215 billion this year compared to last year, $986 million., Pre-tax income, Q2, Up 23%, $1.215 billion, Last year\\'s $986 million, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In terms of income taxes, our income tax rate was a little better than we had anticipated. It came in at 25.8% effective tax rate during Q2 \\'19 compared to 27.7% in Q2 last year. For all of fiscal \\'19, based on our current estimates, which, again, are subject to change, we anticipate that our effective total company tax rate for this fiscal year to be approximately 26% to 26.5%. This figure is about a half a percentage point lower or better than we had previously estimated a quarter ago. This is primarily due to a Q2 tax rate that now includes a one-time benefit for certain foreign tax credits. This one-time tax benefit will continue through the end of this fiscal year but we do not anticipate a similar type of benefit beyond fiscal \\'19., Income tax rate, Q2 \\'19, Effective tax rate, Fiscal \\'19, Foreign tax credits, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, A few other items of note. Again, we opened a net one unit during Q2. Opened two, including a relocation. In Q3, we have three new openings planned and no relocations. We actually opened this morning in Bayonne, New Jersey. In late April, we plan to open our 16th location in Korea and, in early May, our 11th location in Australia. The big expansion quarter for us this year is Q4. We plan to open a net of 12 units -- 14 openings, including two relocations -- including our first opening in China in Shanghai in the city of Manjung and also our third unit in Spain, which would be our second in the Madrid area. Though any of these could slip a little bit but our current best guess right now is 14 openings, including two relocations, so a net of 12., New unit openings, Q3, Expansion quarter, China, Spain, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As of Q2 end, total warehouse square footage totaled 112 million square feet., Total warehouse square footage, Q2 end, Square feet, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 2, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I might also add that, in terms of capex, we continue to allocate more capex to grow and support our operations, including, as you know, over the last year, year and a half, we\\'ve opened a second meat plant -- the first one in California many years ago and then in Morris, Illinois.

However, 11 days earlier this year. This is an important holiday in terms of sales strength. The holiday shift negatively impacted February\\'s other international sales by, we estimate, 450 basis points or 4.5 percentage points, and total company sales by about half a percentage point.

Net income for the quarter came in at $767 million, or $1.73 a share. 19.3% per-share increase compared to $640 million, or $1.45 per share last year in the first quarter. In comparing year-over-year operating results, there were three items noted in the release. One, this year\\'s first quarter benefited from a $59 million -- or $0.13 per share -- income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Last year, the benefit was $41 million, or $0.09 a share in the first quarter last year. Number two, the company also recognized an additional tax benefit this year of $27 million, or $0.06 a share. This related to the implementation of the 2017 tax act., Net income, operating results, first quarter, fiscal 2019, stock-based compensation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The third item noted in the release, this year\\'s first-quarter results included a charge of $43 million pre-tax or $31 million after tax, which is $0.07 a share. For an adjustment to our estimated breakage on rewards for the Citi Visa co-branded credit card program. More on this in our discussion of the gross margin. In terms of sales, net sales for the quarter come in at 34.31 billion, a 10.3% increase over the $31.2 billion reported last year in the first quarter. In terms of comp sales in the release today, for the 12-week fiscal first quarter, U.S. comp sales on a reported basis were up 11%, and not only gas inflation in FX, but revenue recognition, the 11.0 would be 8.3. Canada reported 2.4, ex-gas FX in revenue recognition, and it\\'d be plus 5.5. Other international reported 4.0. Ex those items plus 5.8.

And again, ex those items, plus 26.2. In terms of Q1 sales metrics, first-quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 4.9% worldwide and within the U.S. 5.2%. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales. Gas price inflation benefited Q1 comps, and revenue recognition benefited as well. Combined, those three items added about 130 basis points, essentially the difference you see between the 8.8 reported and the 7.5 that I mentioned above. Cannibalization weighed in on the comp by approximately -70 basis points. Our average front-end transaction or ticket was up 3.7% during Q1, and excluding the impacts from gas and FX in revenue recognition, the average ticket was up approximately 2.4%., E-commerce, sales metrics, traffic, foreign currencies, revenue recognition, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement is membership. Membership, we reported an increase of 9.5%, or $66 million, coming in the quarter at $758 million in the first quarter this year compared to 692 last year. FX had a negative effect of approximately $6.4 million. So the 9.5% increase would\\'ve been about 10.4% ex-FX. Reported membership revenue again was up 9.5; about half of that\\'s related to the membership fee increases taken back in the June of 2017. And as you all know, it takes about twice, three months to get through the book part of the income statement at benefit. Our renewal rates rose in Q4. U.S. and Canada membership remains in Q1 end or came in at 90.5%. That\\'s up from 90.4% just 12 weeks earlier at Q4 end., Membership revenue, membership fee increases, renewal rates, U.S. and Canada membership,\\nQ4 end, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, And worldwide rate improved to 88.0, also up a tenth of a percent, up from 87.9% 12 weeks ago at Q4 end. In terms of the number of members at first quarter end, Gold star at Q1 end was 41.3 million -- that compares to 12 weeks earlier at 40.7 million. Business primary, 7.6, both at quarter-end and year-end. Business add-ons stayed at 3.3. All told, we started the fiscal year -- or we ended last fiscal year with 51.6 million members. We ended Q1 at 52.2. Total cardholders at year-end from last quarter were 94.3, and again, at this first quarter end, it was 95.4. We opened six new warehouses during the quarter., Worldwide rate, number of members, Gold Star members, Business primary, Business add-ons, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Also at first quarter end, paid executive memberships totaled at 19.7 million, which is an increase of 442,000, or 37,000 a week since 12 weeks earlier. That\\'s one of the biggest weekly deltas. Part of it depends on when we do different activities to get members to upgrade, and as new members sign up as well. So you\\'ll see that fluctuate, but certainly a good showing in the quarter. Related to the annual fee increases, I mentioned earlier we\\'ve now passed the halfway point at last year\\'s fourth quarter of the 23-month cycle it takes to recognize the incremental benefit from the fee increase. The benefit will continue to diminish in each of the remaining three quarters in Q\\'s 2, 3, and 4. Very little in Q4, actually. And again, that\\'s based on the deferred accounting, which we use., paid\\nexecutive memberships, annual fee increases, quarterly cycles, deferred accounting, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year over year by 50 basis points, coming in at 10.75% as compared to 11.25% a year earlier. Now, excluding gas inflation and revenue recognition, that minus 50 would\\'ve been a minus 26. I\\'ll start with my line items, if you will, in comparing the minus 50 to the minus 26. If you just jot down two columns of numbers in five lines. The first line is the core merchandise. The second line, ancillary businesses. The third line, 2% reward on the executive membership. The fourth line, other. And then the fifth line, of course, total., gross margin, reported gross margin, excluding gas inflation and revenue recognition, core\\nmerchandise, ancillary businesses, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, On a reported basis, the core merchandise year over year in Q1 was -43 basis points. Ex-gas inflation and revenue recognition, the -43 would be -22. Ancillary businesses, which was a plus-five reported, ex those items would\\'ve been a plus 11. 2% reward, zero and a -2. Other, minus 12 and minus 13. And if you add up those two columns, you\\'d get to the -50 reported, and then ex-gas inflation revenue recognition, the minus 26. Now again, going to the core, the minus 43 ex those items going to -22. That\\'s again based on the sales penetration of that compared to the total company as well. If you look at just the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, what I call core on core, margins year over year were lower by six basis points., core\\nmerchandise, ancillary businesses, 2% reward, other, core on core, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sub-categories within core gross margin year over year in Q1 both food in sundries and hard lines were up, and soft lines and fresh foods were down. The net of those four categories was a -6. Ancillary and other businesses, as I mentioned, reported plus five, plus 11 ex-gas and revenue recognition in the quarter. Gas was up, ecomm was up a little, and businesses were up a little. Pharmacy, a couple of other little things were down a little. But net of those all, they were up 11 basis points ex those items. That\\'s the $43 million pre-tax amount that I mentioned earlier related to the Citi Visa cobranded card. And we put it here because it\\'s part of the deal, things like the rewards that are paid out to the cardholders as well as bounties that are earned and revenues that are shared. So this impacts the revenue line of our company, or the sales line, and therefore it impacts the gross margin percentage. So the 43 million, this relates to our Citi Visa co-branded credit-card program., core\\ngross margin, food and sundries, hard lines, soft lines, fresh foods, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Over the past few months, we made the decision to expand our efforts to remind our members to redeem their outstanding rewards. By stepping up our reminders, we saw step-up in the redemptions relative to what we\\'d experienced previously. These are the reward certificates that were sent out in February of 2018. The rewards program on the Citi Visa card is a calendar-year program. So these reward certificates that were sent out in February of \\'18, for rewards earned on Citi Visa card transactions over calendar \\'17. And that expired at the end of this calendar year. The $43 million adjustment relates to two things: one, to the thing I just described, to the recent increase in these redemptions. And second, the additional breakage amounts now estimated on the rewards being earned and accrued on the calendar year 2018 card transactions. These rewards will be sent to the Citi Visa cardholders in February of 2019. So, what you see in this line is basically an adjustment to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned on purchases made prior to the beginning of fiscal \\'19. Going forward, we\\'re using this lower reward breakage assumption., reward certificates, redemptions, calendar year program, adjustment, breakage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Moving to SG&A, our SG&A percentage Q1 over Q1 was lower or better by 23 basis points on a reported basis. And flat or zero without gas inflation in revenue recognition. Again, came in 10.13% this year on a reported basis compared to 10.36 last year. Again, I\\'ll ask you to jot down two columns and five line items. The first column, of course, is reported, and the second is ex those items., SG&A\\npercentage, reported basis, gas inflation, revenue recognition, ex-gas inflation and revenue\\nrecognition, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The first line is operations, core operations. Q1 \\'19 reported was lower or better by 23 basis points. And lower or better by four ex those items. Central, lower or better I\\'ll use a plus sign. Central, plus four and plus two. Stock compensation, which is always the biggest impact seems to be in Q1 because that\\'s when we do our annual grants for over 5,000 employees. Stock compensation minus four and minus six. And then other is zero. So your total, again, reported the sum of those three line items plus 23 basis points or lower year over year on a reported basis by 23. And the second column, basically flat year over year on an ex those items basis. The core operations component again was lower. This is primarily a result of sales growth, offset in part by the U.S. wage increase to our hourly employees that went into effect on June 11th., operations, core operations, stock compensation, other, U.S. wage increase, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The wage increase negatively impacted SG&A by approximately eight basis points in Q1 year over year. And this will continue to impact the SG&A year-over-year comparisons over the next two quarters. I believe we did it effective June 11th in \\'17 and June 11th \\'18, so it\\'ll go through the same time period a year later. The central expense was lower or better year over year by four on a reported basis, and a lower or better by two without those items. Within that IT spend in the quarter was flat as a percentage of sales. Stock compensation, as I mentioned, the biggest impact typically is in the first quarter, so you\\'ll see a little bit of a difference there. Next on the income statement is a pre-opening expense. It was $5 million higher in this year\\'s quarter, coming in at $22 million compared to $17 a year earlier., wage\\nincrease, SG&A, central expense, IT spend, pre-opening expense, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We had one more opening this year, but there\\'s plenty of other things going on, not just opening new warehouses, with everything from chicken plants to expansion of depots and fulfillment. All told, reported operating income in Q1 came in at $949 million compared to $951 million in Q1 last year. Two of the things that I mentioned in this report, of course, is the 43 million related to the Citi rewards program as well as the hourly wage increases. Those are certainly two things that have impacted the year-over-year comparison. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was $1 million lower year over year. So, coming in at $36 million compared to $37. And on the interest income and other, essentially flat year over year. Interest income within the number was actually $8 million better year over year, higher interest rates and a little higher invested cash balance., operating income, Citi rewards program, hourly wage increases, interest expense, interest income, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Offset by FX items that have amounted to about 9 million to the negative. The FX tends to fluctuate both up and down in prior quarters. In total, pre-tax income was $935 million compared to $936 million a year ago. In terms of income tax rates, income taxes, our reported tax rate in the first quarter was 16.9% compared to 30.4% in the first quarter of last year. this quarter\\'s tax rate benefited from the lower federal rate related to tax law changes as well as some favorable discrete adjustments, notably the $59 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, compared to $41 million a year ago, and a $27 million benefit related to the implementation of the 2017 tax act as I mentioned earlier in the call. For fiscal \\'19, based on our current estimates, and as I mention each quarter, these, of course, are subject to change., pre-\\ntax income, FX items, income tax rate, stock-based compensation, 2017 tax act, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We anticipate that our effective total company tax rate for fiscal \\'19 to be in the 26.5-27% range. This figure is a little more than a percentage point lower than what we had previously estimated, as I had mentioned on our last quarterly conference call. But lower is good. A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion. We\\'ve opened eight locations including two relocations, so a net of six in the first quarter. For all of \\'19, we expect to open about 23 net new warehouses as well as four relocations; the two we\\'ve opened plus two more planned for the rest of the year. Within the 23 net new, about three-quarters of them are in the U.S., and about a quarter of them are international. We\\'re also under construction with our first Costco in China, in Shanghai, with the expected opening later in calendar 2019., taxes, warehouse expansion, international locations, Costco, China, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As of first quarter end, total warehouse square footage stood at 111 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, in Q1 we repurchased $34.5 million of stock, 150,000 shares. I\\'ll turn my attention to e-commerce. Overall, e-commerce sales continued at good levels, both for the quarter and just last week, of course, we reported the four weeks of November, which would include the first week of Q2. For the quarter, reported e-commerce came in at 32.3% up, ex-FX and rev rec, they were up 26%. As you saw last week, the numbers are even a little higher than that for the four-week November period. The good news is, we\\'ve established all kinds of records for orders and sales during the Black Friday through Cyber Monday weekend, as I\\'m sure many analysts have as well. The top growth categories in the quarter were grocery, consumer electronics, hardware, health and beauty aids, and automotive., warehouse square footage, stock buybacks, e-commerce sales, growth categories, Black Friday, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, One highlight of our website refinement during the quarter was our redesign of the home categories. We feel that the refresh made departments like furniture, domestics, and housewares all easier to shop. With that change, we also expanded some of the product selection within those subcategories. We\\'ve now passed our one-year anniversary of the grocery launch last October. Same-day grocery delivery is now available to members within a 20-minute drive of 99% of our U.S. locations. Two-day grocery, which we do through our business centers, is available throughout the continental United States. We continue to focus on providing great values on high-quality merchandise, and we had a few interesting new merchandise items online this quarter., website refinement, home categories, grocery launch, same-day delivery, two-day delivery, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, A couple of examples: fresh white truffles, golf simulators, all types of high-end cosmetics and creams, like La Mer, Pendleton apparel and domestics, George Simonson couture cashmere coats, Wheels Up memberships for air travel, and even a few Super Bowl packages. And hot off the press, we went live online I think yesterday or last evening, but this morning with a full online with basically a clean line of Apple Mac products. Both from MacBook Air to MacBook Pro to the iMac into the MacBook. We\\'re excited about that. Stay tuned for similar offerings in-store. And we\\'re working out the logistics of that. We\\'ve also continued to improve our online and inline cross-marketing initiatives., Mac products, online launch, in-store offerings,\\ncross-marketing initiatives, logistics, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We continue to do that. In addition to drawing attention to our online offerings, these digital communications, we\\'re leveraging that to highlight the feature warehouse items and hot buys in-store in driving traffic. We believe that certainly some of our strength in traffic has to do with that. In terms of an update on buy online and pick up in the store, we\\'ve expanded this selection. No new categories, but some additional assortment. Testing pick-up lockers in about ten locations for this program. Overall, these efforts continue to -- we view as positively impacting our businesses. And again, most importantly, not only online, but in warehouse and probably in the sales in both ways., digital communications, feature warehouse items, hot buys, buy online pick up in\\nstore, testing pick-up lockers, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Quickly, on tariffs. There\\'s not a whole lot new to tell you there. The big news, of course, in the last week or so is the fact that the planned increase on many items from a 10-25% tariff rate effective January 1st has been pushed out, I believe, 60 or 90 days. And so not a whole lot new from a quarter earlier. There are some items that, when the tariffs have been in the 10%+ range, have been very little impact on the sales. Some, there\\'s been a little bit more of a negative impact. We think we\\'ve done a good job. And as one of the senior merchants mentioned, this is what we do with regular price increases as well, cost increases. We figure out how to minimize it. And we brought in additional containers of certain seasonal merchandise early, before the January 1st deadline. And we\\'ll continue to keep you posted., tariffs, planned increase, effective date, impact on sales, cost increases, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2019, 1, Richard Galanti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Lastly, in terms of upcoming press releases, we\\'ll announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, January 6th on January 9th after the market closes. With that, I\\'ll open up to questions, and I\\'ll turn it back to you, Liz., December sales results, press releases, announcement date, investor questions, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Josh, and good afternoon to everyone. I\\'ll start, of course, by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\\'s call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company\\'s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they\\'re made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law., forward-looking statements, risk and uncertainties, SEC filings, update requirements, legal\\ncompliance, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In today\\'s press release, we reported our operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the 12 weeks that ended on May 13th. The income for the quarter was $750 million, or $1.70 per share, compared to $700 million or $1.59 per share last year in the third quarter. Now, last year in the third quarter, our net income was positively impacted by an $82 million or plus $0.19 per share tax benefit. And that was in connection with a $7.00 per share special cash dividend that we had done at the time., third quarter results, operating income, net income, tax benefits, special dividend, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll start by reviewing our third quarter operating results and then allow some time of course for Q&A. In terms of sales, net sales for the quarter came in at $31.62 billion, or 12.1% increase over last year\\'s third quarter sales of $28.22 billion. Net sales for the first 36 weeks of fiscal \\'18 increased 12% to $95.02 billion, up from $84.82 billion last year to date, last year for the first three quarters of the year to date. In terms of comparable sales, which were recorded in the press release, for the 12-week period, the U.S. was a 9.7%, excluding the impact of gas inflation, it was 7.7%. Canada, on a reported basis for the 12 weeks, comps were 11.3%, and ex-gas inflation and FX impact was up 4.8%. Other international reported at 11.8, ex-gas inflation and FX 5.8. So, all told, total company, 10.2% comp, and ex-gas inflation and FX up 7%. Ecommerce, which we of course separated out here, is 36.8% for the 12 weeks and 35.5% ex-FX. So, that continues strong. Similar statistics in the press release for the 36-week year-to-date., third quarter results, sales, net sales, comparable sales, ecommerce, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of third quarter sales metrics, third quarter traffic or shopping frequency was up 5.1%, both worldwide and within the U.S. Strengthening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impacted sales by approximately 145 basis points to the positive. And gasoline inflation added an additional 170 basis points. Cannibalization weighed on the comp to the tune of minus 60 basis points. Our average frontend transaction or frontend ticket was up 4.9%, and again, excluding the benefits from both gas inflation and FX, that average ticket would have been up somewhere in the mid-high single digits, about 1.7%, 1.8% up., third quarter sales, traffic, foreign currencies, gasoline inflation, cannibalization, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement, membership fee income. Reported in the quarter, $737 million, up $93 million from $644 million during Q3 of last year, or up 14.4%. The benefit of strong foreign currencies was about $9 million of that $93 million increase, so ex that, it would have been up $84 million. Now, of the $93 million increase year-over-year, a little over half related to the membership fee increases we have taken in the last year, year-and-a-half, the majority of which came from the $5.00 and $10.00 annual fee increases taken last June 1st in the U.S. and Canada. There\\'s a small balance of that from the fee increases taken in other international operations starting back in September of 2016., membership fee income, foreign currencies, fee increases, annual fees, international\\noperations, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, We will continue, by the way, to see membership fees based on the deferred accounting, the June 1st of \\'17 increases in the U.S. and Canada last year. We\\'ll continue to see the benefit of that year-over-year increasing the membership fee line. I\\'ll peak in Q4 this coming quarter, this 16-week quarter, and then still, year-over-year increases, but -- and all, or at least three, maybe four, all of next year and fiscal \\'19 as well. In terms of membership fee renewal rates, our U.S. and Canada member renewal rates at Q3 end came in at -- were 90.1%, similar to where they stood a quarter earlier at 90.1%. A slight uptick, but still rounding to the 90.1%. Worldwide rates improved from 87.5% -- improved to 87.5%, up from 87.3% 12 weeks ago at Q2 end, with the uptick in renewal rates in our international operations led by Asia, both Taiwan, Japan, and Korea., membership fees, deferred accounting, renewal rates, international operations, Asia, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of number of members at Q3 end, in terms of total number of households, at the end of Q2, it stood at 50.4 million, and 12 weeks later at the end of Q3, it is now -- it then stood at 50.9 million. Total cardholders, 92.2 million a quarter ago, 12 weeks ago, and at Q3 end, 93.0 million. During the fiscal quarter, we had two new openings. Also at Q3 end, as of Q3 end, our paid executive member base stood at 19.0 million households. That\\'s an increase of 199,000 households from 12 weeks earlier, about 17,000 new Gold Star members per week., number of members, total number of households, cardholders, paid executive member base, new\\nopenings, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Related to the benefit from last year\\'s fee increases, that year-over-year quarterly fee increase, as I mentioned, will continue to benefit both Q4 and into several quarters next year, but on a diminished amount each year-over-year quarter., fee increases, benefit, quarterly fee increase, next year, diminished amount, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin third quarter was lower year-over-year by 46 basis points, coming in at 11.05% during the third quarter of fiscal \\'18, compared to 11.51%. Now, that minus 46 basis point figure year-over-year on a reported basis, excluding gas inflation, it could have been minus 28. And let me again ask you, as I usually do, to jot down just a couple of columns for Q3 \\'18. The first one would be as reported. The second one would be excluding the impact of gas inflation. The five line items, the first one would be merchandise core. In Q3 \\'18, on a reported basis, that was down year-over-year by 33 basis points, and ex-gas inflation, down by 17 basis points. Ancillary businesses, reported minus 10 basis points year-over-year, minus six ex-gas inflation. 2% Reward, plus two, as reported, and flat without gas inflation. Other minus five and minus five, and I\\'ll talk about that in a second. So, total, if you add up those two columns on a reported basis, again, gross margin was lower by 46 basis points, ex-gas inflation, lower by 28 basis points., gross margin, merchandise core, ancillary businesses, 2% Reward, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, As I mentioned, looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, so core-on-core, if you will, margins year-over-year in Q3 were lower actually by four basis points. Some categories within core gross margin year-over-year in Q3, Food and Sundries was up slightly, and Hard Lines, Soft Lines, and Fresh Foods, the other three components of core, were down just slightly. The slightly year-over-year core-on-core gross margins in the 3rd quarter resulted from our continuing investment in price to drive sales, and widened the value gap between us and our competition. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin were reported down 10 and down six ex-gas. Some of that is increased gas sales penetration, which is a much lower margin business. Other parts of it is -- some of the other ancillary businesses were down a little bit as well., core merchandise categories, core gross margin, investment in price, value gap, ancillary and other\\nbusinesses, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, 2% Reward was flat ex-gas, as I mentioned, and Other, which was a minus five year-over-year comparison, five basis points. Last year, we were incurring some incremental costs. Well, we had been -- as I mentioned the last two quarters, we\\'d been incurring some incremental costs, primarily related to the role out of our new centralized returns facilities. This will continue to impact us for one more quarter in Q4. In each of the prior two quarters, I had mentioned on kind of a sequential basis on the year-over-year Q1, we estimated it was about a seven basis point negative impact; in Q2, minus six, and in Q3, minus five. And again, there\\'ll be some small detriment, I assume, in Q4, and then we\\'ll have anniversaried that., 2% Reward, Other, incremental costs, centralized returns facilities, Q4 impact, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Moving to SG&A, our SG&A percentage in Q3 year-over-year was lower or better by 32 basis points on a reported base, and ex-gas inflation, better or lower by 16 basis points, coming in at a 9.98% of sales this year reported, compared to 10.30 last year. Like with gross margin, I\\'ll ask you to take the two columns. First one\\'s reported Q3 \\'18, and the second column would be excluding the impact of gas inflation for Q3 \\'18. First one, operations. Better, or plus 26 basis points on a reported basis, and plus 13 basis points, or lower, ex-gas. Central, minus one and minus three. Stock compensation, plus two and plus one. Other, plus five and plus five. So, if you add those two columns up, the first column would add up to the reported 32 basis point improvement in SG&A. And again, ex-gas inflation, it would be plus 16 basis points., SG&A percentage, reported base, ex-gas inflation, operations, central, stock compensation, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Basically, it\\'s all about sales. You know, core operations lower, better strong topline sales lead to improvement in payroll and benefits, and other variable and fixed costs, generally speaking. Central expenses higher year-over-year, as you can see in the little chart we just made, by one basis point on a reported basis and three without gas, primarily related to our continuing IT efforts. Stock compensation, again, lower by a little. Again, strong sales helped that. Other, better by five. That really -- nothing this year. Last year, we pointed out that there were two nonrecurring legal items in Q3 last year, totaling $14 million or five basis points. And we didn\\'t have any detriment related to that this year., sales, core operations, payroll and benefits, central expenses, stock compensation, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement is preopening. Preopening this year came in at $8 million, lower by $7 million from last year\\'s $15 million. This year in Q3, as I mentioned, we had two openings, one in Mexico and one in Korea. Last year, we had three openings, one each in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Last year in the number, we also had some additional spend in Q3 relating to the fourth quarter openings last year in France and Iceland. Upcoming in Q4 this year, we have 15 total openings, 13 net new units plus two relocations. That compares to 12 gross and net locations last year in the quarter., preopening, income statement, openings, Q4 impact, France and Iceland, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, All told, reported operating income in Q3 came in at $1,067,000,000, or up $99 million, or 10% higher year-over-year than last year\\'s $968 million. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense came in at $16 million higher year-over-year, at $37 million this year. That compares to $21 million a year ago. That\\'s mostly a result of last May\\'s $3.8 billion debt offering that we did in conjunction with our special dividend., reported operating income, year-over-year comparison, interest expense, debt offering, special\\ndividend, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Interest income and other was higher or better year-over-year by $23 million in the quarter. Actual interest income and -- mostly interest income in the quarter was better or higher by $6 million. We also benefited year-over-year comparison by various FX items to the tune of $17 million. That\\'s the number that fluctuates both ways. Generally speaking, it\\'s, you know, in the $0 to $15 million range. But this one was $17 million., interest income, other, FX items, year-over-year comparison, fluctuation range, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Overall, pre-tax income was higher by 11%, or $160 million in the quarter, coming in at $1,000,071,000, compared to last year\\'s $965 million. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the third quarter this year came in at 28.8%, compared to last year\\'s reported tax rate of 26.8%. Now last year of course, on a normalized basis, I mentioned that we had that $82 million tax data that related to the national dividend. Last year\\'s normalized rate was 35.5. For fiscal \\'19, based on our current estimates, which of course are always subject to change, we anticipate our effective total company tax rate for the entire year -- with the change in U.S. tax rates benefiting the entire year, the tax rate to be approximately 28%, as we\\'ll have the full fiscal year under the new U.S. federal rates., pre-\\ntax income, income taxes, tax rate, national dividend, effective total company tax rate, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Before I leave the subject of tax law changes, I\\'ll make several comments on that in terms of what our plans are vis-a-vis the savings. As I mentioned last quarter end, we really don\\'t expect any major changes to our capital allocation plans. We generate good cash and pretty much do the things that we want to do in terms of expansion and in terms of regular dividend, and in terms of stock buybacks as well. As mentioned on last year\\'s earnings call, where I said we would use some of the income tax savings in the U.S. to benefit our U.S. employees, and that there will be increases in their hourly wage rates, effective June 11th, our U.S. starting wages will increase from $13.00 and $13.50 an hour to $14.00 and $14.50 an hour, so $1.00 an hour for entry level, with all other hourly warehouse employees receiving an hourly increase anywhere from $0.25 to $0.50 per hour. The estimated annualized cost of these increases that will impact about 130,000-plus thousand employees in the United States will be $110 to $120 million pre-tax, with Q4 being impacted by a little more than $25 million pre-tax., taxes, capital allocation plans, income tax savings, wage increases, Q4 impact, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, We have been investing -- second, next, we have been investing and will continue to invest some of the savings to drive our business, and this will certainly include investing in price as well as other activities. Some of the tax savings this way will fall in the bottom line indirectly by investing and driving value in sales. And then some of the tax savings will go straight to the bottom line., investing, tax savings, bottom line, price, sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, A few other items of note. In terms of expansion, I mentioned we have 15 total openings scheduled for the upcoming 16-week fiscal fourth quarter, which include two relos, so we\\'ll have 13 net openings. That would put us at 21 net new openings for the fiscal year, 25 total, less four relos. In Q1, we opened seven locations, net of five. In Q2, we opened one. In Q3, as I mentioned, we opened two. And for all of fiscal \\'18, again, the 21 net new. Of those 21 net new, a little under two-thirds of them will be in the U.S. Additionally, for fiscal \\'18, we will relocate the four, all of those in the U.S. and those relocated to better and larger facilities. As of Q3 end, total warehouse square footage exceeded 108 million square feet., expansion, openings, fiscal year, U.S., relocation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 3, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of stock buybacks in Q3, $55 million was expended. So, Q3 year-to-date, for the 36 weeks, we repurchased $233 million worth of stocks, or 1.337 million shares, at an average price of $174.30 per share. In terms of our e-commerce activities, e-commerce, we currently operate commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan. Total e-commerce for the third quarter were up 37% year-over-year. Again, that was the Q3 of 36.8%, year-to-date, 36.1%.

You know, historically, this was only in-warehouse, and generally for eight or so weeks per year.

This year\\'s 12-week second quarter included one additional sales day in the United States versus last year, due to the shift of Thanksgiving. But while we gained a sales day in the quarter, our pre-Thanksgiving and Black Friday holiday weekend sales fell in the first quarter this year, compared to the second quarter last year. Combined, these two factors negatively impacted second quarter sales results by an estimated 1.4% in the U.S., and slightly less worldwide, somewhat at or about 1.1%., sales, net sales, quarter, United States, worldwide, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, The shift also negatively impacted e-commerce sales results by an estimated -7 to -8 percentage points in the second quarter. Recall that in Q1, we had an estimated 10% improvement relative to the shift in e-commerce, 5 to 10%. I think if you look at the 24-week fiscal year to date comparable sales results in our earnings release, it essentially eliminates the impact from the holiday shift altogether., shift, e-commerce sales, second quarter, fiscal year to date, comparable sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Now, for the second quarter 12-week comparable sales results. In the U.S., we reported a 7.1% increase. Ex-gas and FX 5.7%. Then we\\'d estimate these add the 1.4% back for the switch in the holiday. Canada, 8.7% reported, and 2.5% ex-gas and FX. Other international reported 15.7%, 7.4%, ex-gas and FX. So total company would be an 8.5% reported and a 5.4% ex-gas and FX, and a little over 1% of negative impact on that 5.4% from the Thanksgiving shift., second quarter, comparable sales, United States, Canada, international, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, E-commerce reported was 28.5% comp sales, 27.3% ex-gas and FX. Again, we estimate that 27.3% was hit by about 7 to 8 percentage points related to the holiday shift, so something in the low to mid-30s X that., e-commerce sales, comp sales, second quarter, fiscal year to date, holiday shift, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of Q2 sales metrics, second quarter traffic or shopping frequency was up 3.7% worldwide and 3.4% in the U.S. Also, these numbers are negatively impacted by the Thanksgiving holiday shift, as I just discussed. In terms of the impact on FX and gas, for the Company, FX assuming flat currency relative to the U.S. dollar over the last year. The strengthening of foreign currencies impacted sales by approximately 180 basis points to the positive. Gas inflation contributed another 125 basis points. So together, about 3 percentage points., traffic, shopping frequency, second quarter, FX, gas, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Cannibalization weighed in on the comp to the tune of 55 basis points to the negative. Our average front-end transaction or ticket was up 4.6% in the quarter. Excluding the net benefits from gas inflations and strong foreign currencies relative to the dollar, it goes up a little over 1.5%., cannibalization, comp, ticket, front-end transaction, gas inflation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Our February sales results were also reported in today\\'s release. I\\'ll review these results at the end of the call. Moving down the income statement for the second quarter, membership income is the next line item. Our reported in Q2, $716 million, up $80 million from the $636 million last year\\'s second quarter, and up about 4 basis points, or 12.6% in dollars. Now, FX, the benefit of strong foreign currencies benefit the number by about $12 million., February sales, membership income, second quarter, FX, income statement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Of the $80 million increase in membership fees increased year-over-year, about $37 million related to membership fee increases. The majority of the $37 million came from fee increases last June 1 in the U.S. and Canada, with a smaller balance from the fee increases taken in our other international operations starting back in September of 2016. All told, if you take out both of those, on a normalized basis, membership fees were up $31 million, or about 5%., membership fees, fee increases, U.S., Canada, international operations, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of renewal rates, our renewal rates improved in Q2 to 90.1% in the U.S. and Canada, up from 90% a quarter earlier. Worldwide improved to 87.3% as of Q2 end, up 0.1% from the 87.2% at Q1 end. I think the most important thing here, of course, is the trends we\\'ve seen with the conversion of the credit card over the last year and a half in the U.S. and slightly overlapping that, prior to that, in Canada. I\\'m happy to see what we expected came true there and we\\'re seeing a slight improvement now., renewal rates, U.S., Canada, credit card conversion, trends, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of members at Q2 end, at Q2 end we had 39.6 million Gold Star Members, up from 39.3 million 12 weeks earlier. Primary businesses were 7.5 million at both quarter ends. Business add-ons, which was 3.2 million at Q1 end, at Q2 end was 3.3. So total member households, 49.9 million at Q1 end, up to 50.4 million at Q2 end. Total cardholders at 92.2 million at the end of the quarter, up from 91.5 million 12 weeks earlier., members, Gold Star Members, primary businesses, business add-ons, cardholders, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, During the quarter, we only had one opening. At Q2 end, paid executive members were 18.8 million, an increase of about 46,000 from the second quarter end, about 4,000 a week. A little softer than it had been in recent quarters. When we look at the quarter though, it started off quite a bit weaker and I\\'m happy to say that the last several weeks have been in the high teens, low 20s on average per week., Membership growth, quarterly performance, revenue increase, member count, sales\\npace, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Lastly, in terms of the portion of membership fee increases related to the recent fee increases, that year-over-year quarterly membership fee income increase will continue to grow each fiscal quarter this year and into Fiscal \\'19, given the deferred accounting treatment as to when it benefits our income statement., Membership fee increases, quarterly membership income, fiscal year, deferred\\naccounting treatment, income statement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, The year-over-year increase will peak in Q4 of this fiscal year. So the $37 million Q2 increase related to that will increase in Q3, and increase again in Q4, based on the P&L on deferred accounting. We had smaller increases in the next couple, three quarters after that, into \\'19., Year-over-year increase, Q4 peak, deferred accounting, P&L, fiscal year \\'19, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Going down the gross margin line, our reported gross margin came in at 10.98%, or 2 basis points lower year-over-year. On a reported basis, that -2 basis points, it was actually +11 basis points excluding gas and FX. Within that, I\\'ll have you just jot down two columns with 4 or 5 numbers in each column. The first column would be as reported and the second column would be without gas inflation., Gross margin, year-over-year comparison, basis points, excluding gas, FX, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, The core merchandise on a reported basis was year-over-year down 20 basis points, down 8 basis points without gas inflation. Ancillary businesses up 23 basis points in the quarter and up 25 ex-gas inflation. 2% reward +1 and 0 in those two columns. And other, -6 and -6 basis points. All told, if you add up column 1, the reported year-over-year gross margin change was the -2 basis points, and ex-gas inflation was +11., Core merchandise, ancillary businesses, reward program, gas inflation, other, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, As I\\'ve done in the past, if you look at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, even though, again, on an ex-gas inflation basis, the core as it contributed to the total company was -8. If you look at core categories on core sales, margins year-over-year in Q2 were higher by 14 basis points. Sub categories within core margins year-over-year in Q2: food and sundries, hard lines, and fresh foods were up. Soft lines were down a little. All these improvements are notwithstanding greater values to our members, as we\\'ve continued to do., Core merchandise categories, sales growth, margin improvement, subcategories,\\nmember value, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Ancillary and other businesses gross margin up 23 basis points and 25 ex-gas inflation. Gas represented a little more than half of that improvement. It\\'s both a combination of the higher sales penetration and improved margins within the business. With hearing aids, pharmacy, optical, business centers, and travel all showing higher year-over-year gross margins, and that contributed to that number as well., Ancillary businesses, gross margin, gas inflation, hearing aids, pharmacy, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, 2% reward, again, essentially flat ex-gas. Lastly, in other, as was in the case of the first quarter, we\\'re incurring costs related to the roll-out of our new, centralized return facilities. This will continue to impact us, as I said last quarter, in each of the next few quarters. Likely a little less each quarter. It was down a basis point from -7 to -6. Long-term, we believe it\\'s a big benefit to us., 2% reward, gas inflation, return facilities, cost impact, long-term benefits, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Moving to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentage Q2 over Q2 was lower or better by 21 basis points and better by 9 basis points, +9 basis points ex-gas inflation, coming in at 10.02% of sales this year compared to 10.23% on a reported basis. Again, the two columns -- reported and without gas inflation., Reported SG&A, year-over-year comparison, basis points, excluding gas inflation,\\nsales percentage, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, The first line item would be operations, +19 basis points and +8 basis points ex-gas inflation. Central, -1 basis point and -2 basis points. Stock compensation, +3 basis points in each column. Then total, +21 basis points or lower or better by 21 basis points on a reported basis, and ex-gas inflation better by 9 basis points. Not a whole lot of unusual items here. The core operations component, again, was better by 8 ex-gas inflation. Strong topline sales we believe led to year-over-year improvement in payroll, benefits, and other traditional expenses like utilities and maintenance., Operations, central, stock compensation, total, payroll, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Central expense higher by a couple of basis points ex-gas. We got a lot going on. Stock compensation better year-over-year by 3 basis points. Again, strong sales and usually that\\'s a number that\\'s most impacting Q1 when we do the big grant every year., Central expense, stock compensation, sales impact, basis points, grant, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Next on the income statement is pre-opening expenses. They were better or lower by $3 billion in Q2 this year. They were $12 million last year, 15. Now again, this year we only opened one new unit. Last year, we opened 4. However, we also have quite a bit of pre-opening related to two big manufacturing plants. One we just opened and one under construction. A new meat plant in the Midwest, as well as our major new chicken plant in Nebraska that\\'s under construction., Pre-opening expenses, unit opening, manufacturing plants, meat plant, chicken\\nplant, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, All told, operating income for Q2 came in at $1,016,000,000, up $172 million or 20% higher year-over-year from last year\\'s $844 million number. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense came in at $6 million higher year-over-year, at $37 million this year compared to $31 million a year ago, primarily a result of last year\\'s debt operating., Operating income, year-over-year comparison, interest expense, debt, operating, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Interest income in other was better year-over-year by $11 million in the quarter. Actual interest income for the quarter was better year-over-year by $5 million. Also benefiting this line item is the year-over-year comparison of mostly various FX items in the amount of a positive $6 million. Overall, pre-tax earnings were higher by 22%, or $177 million hiring Q2, coming in at $986 million this year, compared to $809 million last year in the same quarter., Interest income, year-over-year comparison, foreign exchange, pre-tax earnings,\\nquarter, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter came in at 27.7% for the quarter, compared to 35.6% last year. Of course, the lower tax rate for Q2 this year is as a result of tax law changes. The primary benefit was the result of the lowering of the U.S. federal corporate income tax from 35% to 21%. Given that we don\\'t have a calendar year, so it doesn\\'t align with the traditional calendar year, you take the number of days in our fiscal year, which fall before or after December 31. In our case, it\\'s a blended U.S. federal rate. 35% for 119 days of a fiscal year and 21% the remaining 245 days in the fiscal year. You get an average of 25.58%., Income taxes, tax law changes, tax rate, federal corporate income tax, blended U.S. federal rate, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, The impact of that lower rate on Q2 pre-tax income was $52 million of the $74 million I just mentioned. The other $22 million is basically two main things. One is a true-up of Q1, recognizing in Q1 we had no reason to assume this much lower federal income tax rate. So truing up for the first quarter so that we\\'re in tune for the whole year. The other piece is some positives and some offsets to that relating to various things that have come with the new tax legislation. All told, the net impact of these items in Q2 is an additional $22 million tax benefit. So total tax benefit in Q2, $74 million. The $52 million what I\\'ll call normalized to Q2, the $22 million related to truing up Q1 and other offsets, they go along with the original change in tax laws., Tax benefit, tax rate, federal income tax, true-up, new tax legislation, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Going forward, we anticipate that the effective companywide rate for the balance of \\'18 in Q3 and 4 will probably be in the 29.5 to 30% range. In Fiscal \\'19, based on what we currently know, and of course all that\\'s subject to change, we assume it\\'ll be approximately 28%, plus or minus. As we know more, we\\'ll share it with you., Effective tax rate, companywide rate, fiscal year, Q3, Q4, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Overall, the reported net income was higher by 36%, coming in at $701 million in Q2, compared to the $515 million last year. Again, up 22% ex the tax benefits I just spoke about. Before I leave the subject of tax law changes, a few comments as to what our plans are vis-à-vis these savings., Net income, year-over-year comparison, tax law changes, tax benefits, plans, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Overall, (1) we do not expect any major changes to our capital allocations plans. We\\'re generally a net positive cash flow operator notwithstanding CapEx and dividends and what have you. (2) As many others have done, we will use some of these savings to benefit our employees. We\\'re working on that. Stay tuned. (3) We\\'ll invest some of the savings to continue to drive greater value to our members. This will certainly include investing in price, as well as other activities. (4) When asked, and we have been, if any of these tax savings will fall to the bottom line, the answer is yes. Most importantly, indirectly, by investing in driving value, we\\'ve seen what that does and we know what that does. Much of that investing in value and price comes back in greater earnings, and directly perhaps a little, but again, stay tuned., Capital allocations plans, cash flow, employee benefits, investment in value and\\nprice, tax savings, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, A few other items of note: warehouse expansion. As I mentioned, we opened only 1 unit in Q2. That\\'s on top of 5 net new units in Q1. Our plans for the current quarter, which will end in mid-May is 2 more. Then Q4 is the big quarter. It\\'s a 16-week quarter, but we plan to open net 15 units. 18 openings, including 3 relos. Assuming we got there, we\\'d have 23 net openings for the year. My guess is it will be 22 or 23. A little better than I think I mentioned a quarter ago. But somewhere in those low 20s., Warehouse expansion, unit openings, net openings, quarterly plans, guess, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, For all of \\'18, again, we expect to open something around 22 or 23, with three-quarters of those in the next two quarters and most of it in the fourth quarter. As of Q2 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 108 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, in all Fiscal 2017, we expended $473 million, purchasing just under 3 million shares at an average price of just under $158., Warehouse openings, stock buybacks, total warehouse square footage, quarterly\\nplans, share price, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In the first quarter, we expended, as mentioned, $119 million, at an average price of about $162.50.

We currently operate e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan. Total e-commerce sales for the second quarter came in at $1.5 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Overall, our e-commerce sales increases continue at very strong levels. If you look back at Q1, FX was a positive 42.1%. Again, there was a jump in there that related to the benefit of the Thanksgiving holiday shift.

So continued very strong sales growth and momentum in these numbers., Sales growth, quarterly performance, year-over-year comparison, monthly trends,\\npress release, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, We continue to prove our offerings and we continue to be helped by improved member experience with better search checkouts and return processes, as I\\'ve shared some of that with you in the past. In the quarter, our site traffic and conversion rates and orders were up nicely year-over-year. Our warehouses are supporting Costco.com with signage and tablets in the store. We now have that in 195 U.S. buildings. That\\'s used to help search and purchase Costco.com items for our members from our warehouses., Offerings, member experience, site traffic, conversion rates, warehouse support, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, We continue to capture more email addresses. In addition, our improved content is resulting in an increase in our open rate of emails. Again, driving traffic both in-store and online. If you go right now to Costco.com, I think it talks about hot buys. You\\'ll see that some of them are in-warehouse-only as supplies last. We think that we\\'ve got some excitement going here in terms of driving traffic both specifically in store using the internet and emails, as well as driving traffic online. A great example of that is, again, you can look for it yourself with these hot buys in the warehouse., Email addresses, open rate, traffic driving, hot buys, in-store and online sales, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Online grocery, both our dry grocery 2-day delivery and our same-day fresh delivery through Instacart, as I mentioned last quarter, rolled out in early October. It\\'s been quite positive year-to-date and growing. We\\'re just starting to do some limited marketing. Instacart now is in 441 of our U.S. warehouses and should be in most of the remainder of our U.S. warehouses by calendar year-end., Online grocery, Instacart, delivery, marketing, warehouse expansion, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, We continue to improve the online merchandise and services offerings. Again, not only in general but with hot buys. We\\'ve improved our apparel offerings. We\\'re doing a better job of focusing on adding items that are complementary to our warehouse offerings. We\\'re doing some great things with some big-ticket [inaudible] [00:20:55] items where we might be out of them on a given date or start them on a certain date in store, but online we can afford greater availability of those. Then we\\'re doing some other exciting things.

That\\'s something that we had not done in the past. That\\'s for our executive members. As well, if you use your Costco Visa co-branded card, you get 3% that way, so it\\'d be 5% off of what\\'s already great values and seeing great growth in Costco Travel., Costco Travel, reward program, executive members, Costco Visa co-branded card,\\ngrowth, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, As I think I mentioned last time on the call, we\\'re offering a very limited buy online, pickup in store. These are really basically selected, small-size, big-ticket items where many people aren\\'t likely to want to leave them at their doorstep. So some jewelry, tablets, and laptops, and most recently handbags. All these things are driving shops in store. Over half the people that are doing this are shopping in-store when they\\'re there. But again, this is limited. We\\'ll continue to see how it works. All these efforts that I\\'ve just mentioned are having a positive impact on our business both online and in the warehouse. We believe it helps in the sales momentum and increased awareness of our digital presence, as well as the traffic that we\\'ve enjoyed recently in our warehouses., Buy online, pickup in store, limited buy, jewelry, tablets, laptops, handbags, sales\\nmomentum, digital presence, traffic, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In sum, we\\'re continuing to expand these activities.

Certainly, some of the tax savings will go toward driving that as well., Business expansion, tax savings, online sales, in-store sales, evolution and improvement, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Next, let me review the February sales results before we ended March 4. As reported in our release, net sales for the month came in at $10.21 billion, a 12.8% increase from the $9.05 billion last year. Lunar New Year and the Chinese New Year occurred in February this year, as compared to January last year.

The 8.4% reported for Canada would be a 3.2%. The 22.2% other international would still be a very strong 14.1%. Total company, 10.5% reported comp, ex-gas and FX, 7.7% to the positive.

Internationally in local currencies: Taiwan, Japan, and Mexico were at the top of the list this month. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar, total company benefited by about 150 basis points. Again, for the last quarter, it was 180.

A very small impact other international to the tune of 30 basis points., Cannibalization, total company, U.S., Canada, other international, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of merchandise highlights, food and sundries comp sales for the month were positive, mid-to-high single digits. Departments with the strongest results were tobacco, liquor, and candy. Hard lines were up low double-digits. Better performing departments were majors, tires, and health and beauty aids, HABA.

Within ancillary businesses, gas also still helped by the cannibalization of gas, food court, and optical had the best comp sales results in February.

As you know, we reported our earnings 45 minutes before the call. The first thing that comes in some of the news releases very quickly is where we beat the number or we missed the number. When we look at first call and the 27 or so analysts that put numbers in there, it appears to us there are about 12 of the 27 over the last month or so have adjusted their numbers, their estimates for some estimate of tax reform benefit. If you adjust based on what they were before that, it looks like the first call number of $1.46, I believe, comes down $0.04 or $0.05. But I\\'m just mentioning that because I assume there\\'s confusion out there on everybody as we report given this quarter of transition., earnings reports, analyst estimates, tax reform benefits, first call numbers, confusion, Costco Wholesale Corp.\\nCOST, 2018, 2, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, Lastly, our Fiscal \\'18 third quarter scheduled earnings release date for the 12-week third quarter ending May 13.

I will then turn it over to Hugh for additional perspectives on our financial results and 2020 outlook., Thank you, Ravi, Good Morning,\\nBusiness Performance, Guiding Principles, Priorities, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, But before I start the business review, I would like to note that I am very pleased with how our people and businesses have performed in what continues to be a complex and volatile environment. As this environment continues to evolve, we remain very focused on controlling what we can with an unwavering commitment to: keeping our employees safe; servicing our customers to the very best of our ability; and supporting our communities in both good and difficult times. The dedication and resilience of our employees have been nothing short of exemplary during these times and I want to thank them for everything they do., Pleased, Performance, Complex\\nEnvironment, Commitment, Employees, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, with respect to our business performance, our organic revenue growth accelerated in the third quarter. Our global snacks and food business remained resilient, while our global beverage business returned to growth. Specifically, our Q3 organic revenue growth accelerated to 4.2%, with both our North America and International businesses delivering mid-single-digit growth. Our global snacks and food businesses delivered 6% organic revenue growth, while our global beverage business delivered 3% organic revenue growth. The global beverage business meaningfully improved versus the previous quarter with especially encouraging results in our PepsiCo Beverages North America division., Business Performance, Organic\\nRevenue Growth, Snacks and Food Business, Beverage Business, Global Growth, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Core constant currency operating profit increased 5% and reflected an increase in our advertising and marketing spend, and core constant currency EPS increased 9%., Core Constant Currency Operating\\nProfit, Advertising and Marketing Spend, Core Constant Currency EPS, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, starting with North America snacks and food, both Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods continued to deliver robust growth as at-home consumption trends have remained strong despite the measured reopening of economies and activities in certain areas since May. Frito-Lay sustained its strength with 6% organic revenue growth and gained market share in the macro-snack category in the quarter. These results were powered by strong net revenue growth across each of our $1 billion brands, including double-digit growth for Tostitos, high-single-digit growth for Cheetos, and mid-single-digit growth for Doritos and Ruffles. We also saw continued strength in the e-commerce and large format channels, while trends in the convenience and gas channel meaningfully improved versus the previous quarter. And finally, Frito\\'s core constant currency operating profit increased 4% in the quarter, which included a strong double-digit increase in advertising and marketing spend and additional COVID-19-related costs., North America Snacks and Food,\\nFrito-Lay, Quaker Foods, At-Home Consumption Trends, Advertising and Marketing Spend, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Quaker Foods delivered 6% organic revenue growth, along with an improvement in household penetration rates in the quarter. Quaker\\'s revenue growth was in-line with what we had expected and consistent with where the business was trending after economies in certain areas began to reopen during the second quarter. Quaker\\'s third quarter performance included strong double-digit net revenue growth in lite snacks and side dishes such as pasta and macaroni and cheese. Pancake mixes and syrup sales increased at a high-single-digit rate, while both hot and ready-to-eat cereal also delivered good growth. Quaker\\'s strong net revenue growth and cost management initiatives resulted in a 170 basis point increase in core operating margin and 14% increase in core constant currency operating profit., Quaker Foods, Organic Revenue Growth, Household Penetration Rates, Net Revenue Growth, Core\\nOperating Margin, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, I will turn to our North America beverages business, where we delivered a strong improvement in results with 3% organic revenue growth and 12% core constant currency operating profit growth. Many of our large brands performed well with double-digit net revenue growth for bubly, Lipton and Starbucks, high-single-digit growth for Gatorade, mid-single-digit growth for Mountain Dew and Tropicana, and low-single-digit growth for Pepsi., North America Beverages, Organic Revenue Growth, Core Constant Currency Operating Profit,\\nLarge Brands, Net Revenue Growth, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Innovation has continued to play an important role in the portfolio. For example, Gatorade Zero, bubly and Mountain Dew Zero Sugar, in aggregate, have delivered more than $1 billion in retail sales on a year-to-date basis. We also continue to invest in our successful Pepsi Zero Sugar product, which has grown in its retail sales by more than 30% year-to-date., Innovation, Portfolio, Gatorade Zero, Mountain Dew Zero Sugar, Retail Sales, Pepsi Zero\\nSugar, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, From a channel performance perspective, both the large format and convenience and gas channels delivered strong growth, while the decline in the foodservice channel moderated. Our market share trend within the liquid refreshment beverage category improved versus the previous quarter and we gained market share in the coffee, tea and juice categories. We also executed well on our net revenue management initiatives in larger categories such as carbonated soft drinks and sports drinks., Large Format, Convenience and Gas Channels, Foodservice Channel, Liquid Refreshment\\nBeverage Category, Market Share Trend, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In addition, our expanded presence in the energy category contributed to our net reported growth and reported operating profit in the quarter. We are very excited about our expanded presence in this highly profitable category with our recent acquisition of Rockstar and distribution agreement with Bang. Our focus will remain on improving the performance and marketplace execution of these terrific brands, while also effectively competing in the category with existing brands such as Mountain Dew. Overall, I\\'m very pleased with PBNA\\'s performance during the third quarter and I\\'m encouraged by our North America energy integration process as it nears its completion. Moving forward, I remain optimistic about the long-term potential of the North America beverage business and believe we have the right plans and portfolio in place to deliver sustainable growth and margin expansion over time., North America Beverage Business, Energy Category, Mountain Dew, PBNA Performance, Long-term\\nPotential, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In summary, our North America businesses performed well in the quarter and we expect our snacks and foods business to remain resilient, while our beverage business should sustain its momentum for the balance of this year., North America Business, Snacks and Foods Business, Beverage Business, Momentum, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, I will turn to our international businesses, which improved meaningfully versus the previous quarter and delivered 4% organic revenue growth in the third quarter. Our international snacks business remained very resilient and delivered 5% organic revenue growth, while our international beverage organic revenue increased nearly 2% as pandemic-related closures and restrictions eased to a certain extent in some markets., International Businesses, Organic Revenue Growth, Snacks Business, Beverage Business,\\nPandemic-Related Closures, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Within our international markets, developed market organic revenue growth increased 8% and outpaced developing and emerging markets, which increased 2%. Some notable highlights include double-digit organic revenue growth in France, Australia, and Brazil, high-single-digit growth in India and mid-single-digit growth in the UK, China and Russia. We gained savory share in many of our key snack markets, including Mexico, Brazil, China and Russia, and for beverages, we gained share in the UK, Russia, Turkey, France, Germany and Thailand., International Markets, Organic Revenue Growth, Developed Markets, Emerging Markets, Notable\\nHighlights, Savory Share, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L.

Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, to touch on the outlook for our international businesses, we expect our snacks business to remain resilient, while the recovery for our beverage business may take more time due to ongoing and reinstated pandemic-related restrictions and closures as it relates to certain channels. And from a geographical perspective, we continue to expect our performance to vary between developed and developing and emerging markets due to differences in: pandemic-related impacts and responses; disposable income and affordability metrics; foreign exchange dynamics; and, fiscal and monetary policy support., Pandemic-Related Restrictions, International Business Outlook, Geographical Performance,\\nPandemic-Related Impacts, Foreign Exchange Dynamics, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, To conclude, I believe our overall business is performing well and is benefiting from the diversity and breadth of our portfolio and strategic actions we have taken to complement our growth agenda. We are content with the composition of our portfolio and are more focused now on maximizing the full potential of our existing and recently acquired assets to drive improved growth and returns over time as we aim to become an even faster, stronger and better organization., Diversity, Strategic Actions, Growth Agenda, Portfolio Composition, Asset Maximization, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And I\\'d like to spend a few minutes on reinforcing this strategic framework that prioritizes our actions and behaviors within the Company. When we say faster, we mean that we must win in the marketplace and improve market share by being more consumer-centric and investing in both large, established brands and smaller, emerging brands to accelerate our growth. Our key priorities to become faster include: sustaining or improving growth and market share in our high-return snacks and food businesses in North America; improving the profitability of our North America beverage business and capturing our fair share of category growth; accelerating our growth and presence in international snacks and food, while investing wisely in beverages to balance between growth and returns; and making the necessary investments in our manufacturing capacity, go-to-market systems and digital initiatives, such as improving our presence and scale in our e-commerce business, which nearly doubled during the third quarter., Faster, Market Share, Consumer-Centric, Growth Priorities, International Business,\\nE-Commerce, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, When we say stronger, we mean that we must continue to transform our cost structure, capabilities, and culture. Our priorities here include a renewed focus on driving holistic cost management throughout all our organizations to support our investments in advantaged capabilities such as: a highly agile and flexible end-to-end value chain; more precision around revenue management; investing in data analytics that can provide more granularity around consumer insights; and we continue to invest to further expand global business services into new capabilities, which will enable better insight and support for our businesses at a much lower cost., Stronger, Cost Management, Holistic Cost Management, Agile Value Chain, Precision Revenue\\nManagement, Data Analytics, Global Business Services, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, With respect to transforming our culture, we are committed to diversifying our workforce, balancing internal views with more outside-in thinking, and reinforcing The PepsiCo Way, where we emphasize that employees act like owners to get things done quickly., Diversifying Workforce, Outside-In Thinking, The PepsiCo Way, Employee Ownership,\\nCultural Transformation, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And when we say better, we\\'re focused on further integrating purpose into our business strategy and brands by becoming planet positive, strengthening our roots in our communities, and advancing social justice. For example, we are committed to becoming planet positive by supporting practices and technologies that improve farmer livelihoods and agricultural resiliency. We are also focused on using precious resources such as water more efficiently, accelerating our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout our value chain and driving progress toward a world where plastics need never become waste by focusing on reducing, recycling, and reinventing packaging., Planet Positive, Social Justice, Purpose-Driven Business, Resource Efficiency,\\nSustainability, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And when it comes to our people across the value chain, PepsiCo remains committed to advancing respect for human rights, building diverse and inclusive workplaces, and investing to promote shared prosperity in local communities where we live and work., Respect for Human Rights, Diverse and Inclusive Workplaces, Shared Prosperity, Local\\nCommunities, Investment in Prosperity, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In summary, I believe we are executing well against our strategic framework and remain well-positioned for future success with our: portfolio of large, trusted brands that participate in attractive and growing categories; a team of trusted and highly seasoned business leaders; a very powerful go-to-market distribution system; and, an agile, end-to-end supply chain network., Portfolio, Brands, Business Leaders, Go-To-Market Distribution, Agile Supply Chain, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Before I conclude my portion of this discussion today and turn it over to Hugh, I want to reiterate that I\\'m incredibly proud of the way our organization has executed and performed in what has been an incredibly complex and dynamic environment. And I want to thank everyone again for their dedication and efforts., Incredible Performance, Dynamic Environment, Dedication, Efforts, Complexity, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. As Ramon covered in detail, our business performance improved in the third quarter and we delivered 4.2% organic revenue growth. I\\'ll focus my commentary on our profit performance and financial outlook for 2020., Business Performance, Profit Performance, Financial Outlook, Organic Revenue Growth,\\nThird Quarter, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, From a margin perspective, our core gross margin declined 60 basis points in the quarter. The year-over-year decline is driven by our recently completed acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery and certain COVID-19-related costs included in our cost of goods sold. Our core operating margin decline moderated and was down 40 basis points in the quarter as we increased our advertising and marketing spend and experienced $147 million of higher labor, personal protective equipment, and logistics and service costs associated with COVID-19. When excluding the incremental COVID-19-related costs, our core operating margin increased 40 basis points. We expect some of the COVID-19-related costs to persist and remain committed to making the necessary long-term investments to support our employees and customers, while also investing in capabilities that drive competitive advantages for our business., Margin Perspective, Core Gross Margin, Year-Over-Year Decline, COVID-19-Related Costs,\\nLong-Term Investments, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, To mitigate some of these challenges, we have continued our efforts to control what we can. This includes tightly managing our discretionary expenses, reducing non-essential advertising and marketing spend to reflect the realities of the current environment and sharpening our revenue management capabilities across brands and packages., Tight Expense Management, Reducing Advertising Spend, Revenue Management Capabilities,\\nEssential Advertising, Current Environment, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Now, as we look forward, and consistent with Ramon\\'s earlier comments, we do expect our North America businesses to remain resilient for the balance of this year, while the recoveries across international markets will likely remain uneven across both developed and developing and emerging markets. So, based on what we can reasonably predict for the balance of this year, we are updating our full-year guidance and now expect: organic revenue growth of approximately 4%; and core earnings per share of approximately $5.50; and we continue to expect a core annual effective tax rate of approximately 21%. Based on current market consensus rates, we now expect foreign exchange translation headwinds to negatively impact our net revenue and core earnings per share performance by negative 2 percentage points and this expectation is reflected in our core EPS guidance., Resilient Business, Uneven Recoveries, Full-Year Guidance, Organic Revenue Growth, Core\\nEarnings Per Share, Foreign Exchange Translation Headwinds, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, With respect to cash flow, we now expect full-year cash flow of approximately $6 billion, which reflects net capital spending of approximately $4 billion and continue to expect total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion, comprised of dividends of $5.5 billion and share repurchases of $2 billion. Our expected cash returns reflect a 7% increase in the annualized dividend per share that began in June. This represented the Company\\'s 48th consecutive annual dividend per share increase., Cash Flow, Net Capital Spending, Total Cash Returns, Dividends, Share Repurchases, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, With respect to our liquidity and balance sheet, we continue to believe that we have ample flexibility to meet the reinvestment needs of the business and return cash to shareholders., Liquidity,\\nBalance Sheet, Reinvestment Needs, Shareholder Returns, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 3, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, With that, we conclude our prepared remarks for today.

We ask that you please limit yourself to one question., Chairman And CEO, Ramon Laguarta, Vice Chairman And CFO, Hugh Johnston, Questions Limit, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question., Operator, Questions, First Question, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. I\\'ll spend some time today discussing the current environment, our business performance, and then provide thoughts on our expectations going forward, given the unprecedented level of volatility that we currently face. I\\'ll then turn it over to Hugh for additional color on the financial details., Thank You, Ravi, Good Morning, Business Performance, Expectations Going Forward,\\nVolatility, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our second quarter began during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic for most of our markets. As we started the quarter, we set clear, simple priorities to manage the business successfully through the enormous challenges that were happening with the consumer, customer, economy and operating environment. These priorities included: ensuring the protection and safety of all our associates, especially our critical front-line workers, by providing suitable personal protective equipment and sanitizers, conducting health screenings and implementing contact tracing and social distancing protocols; providing the best service possible to our customers and competing to win in the marketplace; ensuring that we have adequate liquidity to run the business; continuing to invest in capabilities that will drive our long-term success; supporting the communities that we do business in and the people who live in them; and delivering strong financial results while executing against the above priorities., COVID-19\\nPandemic, Priorities, Protection And Safety Of Associates, Customer Service, Liquidity, Investments,\\nCommunity Support, Financial Results, Execution, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Based on this clarity of purpose, I\\'m pleased to report that our business performed relatively well through this unprecedented level of change. Specifically, our organic revenue increased 3.3% for the first half of this year, while second quarter organic revenue declined 0.3%. During the second quarter, our portfolio worked well as our global snacks business remained very resilient with 5% organic revenue growth, while global beverages declined minus 7% as increased take-home consumption was more than offset by a decline in the convenience and gas and away-from-home channels., Revenue growth, organic\\nrevenue, change management, portfolio performance, beverages, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our core operating margin declined by approximately 200 basis points in the second quarter, which included nearly $400 million of incremental COVID-19-related costs to keep our employees safe and ensure business continuity. Excluding these costs, our core operating margin would have increased in the quarter., COVID-19, operating\\nmargin, cost management, business continuity, employee safety, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The months of March and April were particularly challenging, as overall global economic growth was contracting and restrictions, closures, and the resultant impact on consumer mobility had a significant effect on our performance. However, we saw an improvement in our business performance and channel dynamics in May and June, as population mobility increased after many economies gradually began to reopen both in developed and in developing market., Global economic growth,\\nconsumer mobility, business performance, channel dynamics, reopening, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, turning to our business review for the quarter, I will start with North America. Our snacks and food businesses performed very well, while our beverage business was challenged but continued to improve its competitive positioning. Within snacks and food, we delivered strong organic revenue growth across both Frito-Lay and Quaker, driven by strong category growth and market share gains. Consumer eating habits continued to evolve with consumers spending more time at home, which benefits the at-home breakfast, snacking and dinner occasions., snacks, food, beverages,\\norganic revenue growth, consumer eating habits, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Organic revenue at Frito-Lay North America grew 6%, and we gained share -- market share in salty, savory and macro-snacks in the quarter. Frito\\'s net revenue growth was broad-based across all our major brands, including double-digit growth in Tostitos, Fritos and Cheetos, high-single digit growth in Ruffles, and mid-single digit growth in Doritos. Emerging brands such as Bare and Off the Eaten Path also delivered double-digit growth., organic revenue growth,\\nmarket share, brand performance, emerging brands, growth, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our larger pack sizes and multipacks performed very well, as consumers\\' desire for variety continued to grow. In addition, Frito\\'s performance in large-format channels was strong, which more than offset the declines in the convenience and gas and away-from-home channels., larger pack sizes,\\nmultipacks, variety, large-format channels, convenience channels, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frito\\'s core operating margin declined in the quarter due to COVID-related costs, including front-line incentives and higher protective personal equipment and sanitation costs. Excluding these COVID-related costs, Frito\\'s core operating margin would have increased by 185 basis points., COVID-related costs, core\\noperating margin, excluding COVID-related costs, front-line incentives, protective personal\\nequipment and sanitation costs, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, At Quaker Foods, organic revenue increased 23% in the quarter with strong share performance across multiple categories and most brands posting net revenue growth despite supply constraints across a range of our products. Many categories within the Quaker business delivered double-digit revenue growth, driven by increased breakfast occasions, in-home dinners, and baking occasions., organic revenue growth,\\nshare performance, supply constraints, breakfast occasions, in-home dinners, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Quaker was also able to increase household penetration during the quarter, and many of our Quaker\\'s categories have grown even as economies reopened during the later parts of the quarter with consumers purchasing and incorporating these products into their repertoire of food consumption., household penetration,\\neconomic reopening, consumer purchasing habits, product incorporation, food consumption, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We also have strong plans in place to retain incremental households with marketing and activation plans across the Quaker portfolio during the balance of this year, including the launch of Cheetos Mac \\'n Cheese this coming fall. From a profitability perspective, Quaker\\'s operating profit increased 55% in the quarter as strong operating leverage drove a 600 basis point improvement in its operating margin., incremental households,\\nmarketing and activation plans, profitability, operating leverage, operating margin, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, I will turn to our North America Beverage business, which had a challenging quarter as we had expected. Organic revenue declined 7% due to declines in the convenience and gas and foodservice channels, which more than offset good growth in other channels such as grocery, mass and dollar stores. However, our revenue management initiatives enabled strong pricing gains across the business and within key categories such as carbonated soft drinks and sports drinks., organic revenue growth,\\nrevenue management initiatives, convenience channels, foodservice channels, pricing gains, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Both Pepsi Zero Sugar and bubly continued to deliver strong double-digit net revenue growth, while our ready-to-drink coffee products delivered high-single digit net revenue growth in the quarter. In addition, we gained market share in ready-to-drink coffee, tea and enhanced waters during the quarter, while our market share trends improved in carbonated soft drinks, sports drinks, and juices as the quarter progressed., Pepsi Zero Sugar, bubly,\\nready-to-drink coffee, market share, carbonated soft drinks, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L.

Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Before I conclude on beverages, I\\'m also pleased to know that our transition and integration process with Rockstar and the distribution of Bang Energy is nearly complete. We have very strong growth and market share ambitions with respect to this highly profitable category and intend to use the depth and breadth of our portfolio and distribution capabilities to improve our execution and store presence. Our energy strategy will consist of three elements. Specifically, we will look to accelerate the performance of Rockstar, which has further room for growth; we will expand the distribution of Bang and improve execution in the marketplace; and we would unlock the potential for Mountain Dew to expand in the energy category., transition and\\nintegration process, growth and market share ambitions, energy strategy, execution and store\\npresence, Mountain Dew expansion, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, as we look ahead for North America, we expect our overall business to perform well, assuming there is no large-scale disruption in economic activity or population mobility as a result of the recent surge in COVID-19 infections in many markets. With this in mind, we expect our snacks and food businesses to remain resilient, albeit with some moderation in growth, while our beverage business should deliver better performance during the second half of this year., COVID-19 impact, economic\\nactivity, population mobility, snacks and food business, beverage business, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, From a channel perspective, we\\'ve seen an improvement in the performance of the convenience and gas channels since the later part of the second quarter. Foodservice trends have also improved, but this channel continues to be in decline and would likely take a bit more time to recover. Most of our remaining traditional channels have continued to perform well, while our e-commerce US retail sales doubled in the quarter., convenience and gas\\nchannels, foodservice trends, traditional channels, e-commerce US retail sales, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, moving on to our international businesses. Our second quarter results, which incorporated the months of March, April and May, were significantly impacted by the timing of COVID-19 restrictions and closures, which varied by country and by region. As we saw in North America, our international snacks and food businesses proved to be more resilient than beverages, with an increase in organic revenue growth of 2% in snacks versus a decline of 5% in beverages., COVID-19 impact,\\ninternational businesses, snacks and food businesses, beverage business, organic revenue growth, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Across our developed markets, organic revenue increased 18% in Germany, 9% in Australia and 3% in the United Kingdom. And in developing and emerging markets, organic revenue increased 30% in China, 8% in South Africa, 7% in Brazil and 3% in Mexico. Our SodaStream business also posted another quarter of strong double-digit net revenue growth as consumers are increasingly enjoying this environmentally friendly at-home platform., organic revenue growth,\\ndeveloped markets, developing and emerging markets, SodaStream business, environmental friendly\\nplatform, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, With respect to our competitive position, we improved our year-to-date market share of snacks in Mexico, China, Brazil, UK, France and Spain, while we held or improved our market share of beverages in the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Mexico, Brazil and Thailand., competitive position,\\nmarket share, snacks, beverages, geographic markets, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Much like in North America, our international business trends began to improve during the month of May as some businesses and economies reopened. In addition, our snacks business has remained very resilient. However, we do expect an uneven recovery in international markets, as a greater level of macroeconomic uncertainty would likely persist due to varying responses and measures by country to address pandemic-related impacts and population mobility; a greater volatility in travel and tourism trends; and greater differences in disposable income and affordability. These are two metrics we will be keeping a very close eye on as we consider -- as and when we consider surgical adjustments to offer great value in lower income market., international business\\ntrends, snacks business, macroeconomic uncertainty, travel and tourism trends, disposable income and\\naffordability, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, To summarize, we\\'re pleased with our overall results in what was a very difficult environment. We remain committed to leveraging our strengths and principles, what we call The PepsiCo Way, to help guide our business leaders and associates in both good and difficult times. This includes reinforcing our culture in a manner that encourages our associates to act like owners with integrity, and get things done quickly. We believe acting on these principles will enhance our standing with customers, with communities and employees., The PepsiCo Way, culture,\\nintegrity, customer standing, community standing, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L.

Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, To continue our journey in becoming faster and best position ourselves to navigate in the current environment, we\\'ve instituted an even greater focus on capturing more opportunities in the marketplace and improving value share; rethinking what value and affordability means for our consumers and rapidly adjusting our offerings when necessary; simplifying our portfolio and commercial programs and making resource allocation adjustments to win with our customers and our consumers; and also making calculated growth investments in priority markets that can enable us to emerge even stronger after the crisis., capturing opportunities, improving value share, simplifying portfolio, commercial programs,\\ncalculated growth investments, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As it relates to becoming stronger, we are putting an even greater emphasis on our businesses to have a zero-based spending mindset in which we must earn our budgets. In doing so, we continually identify savings and use them to fund new investments; prioritizing critical initiatives that will transform the operating capabilities of the company for the future, such as accelerating the digital transformation of the company; and finally, reevaluating and stress testing other less critical investments, always seeking to optimize the investment portfolio for higher returns., zero-based spending\\nmindset, budget earning, savings identification, digital transformation, investment optimization, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And then, becoming better involves: raising our ambitions to become Planet Positive; continuing to integrate purpose into our business strategy and brands; and supporting and strengthening our local communities and promoting social justice, two topics that I will briefly expand on today., Planet Positive, purpose-\\ndriven business strategy, social justice, community support, ambition raising, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, With respect to our communities, we have announced more than $60 million in investments to help communities around the world stay healthy and safe during COVID-19, which includes initiatives to help feed families and seniors, increase medical care and testing, expand access to government support, and provide technology for remote education and work., investments, community\\nhealth, COVID-19 support, education technology, government support, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, To promote social and economic progress, we have also announced more than $400 million set of initiatives over five years to support Black communities and increase Black representation at all levels of PepsiCo and among our partners and our suppliers. We believe these initiatives comprise a holistic effort for PepsiCo to walk the talk of a leading corporation and help address the need for meaningful, long-term change in our society., social progress, economic\\nprogress, Black communities, representation, societal change, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, To conclude, we believe that PepsiCo is well-positioned to adapt and succeed over the long-term. We will continue to collaborate and leverage learnings across our entire organization to build on our strengths, many of which have been advantageous for us both pre- and post-pandemic, including: large, well-known brands that consumers love, and most importantly, that consumers trust; strong positions in growing categories with expandable consumer traits; an agile supply chain with strong local sourcing networks; a flexible and advantaged direct-store delivery go-to-market system; and a highly experienced set of global business leaders who have the empowerment, the knowledge and agility to make rapid, decentralized decisions to meet the needs of their local businesses., trust, brand strength,\\ncategory growth, supply chain agility, global leadership, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Ramon L. Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Before I turn it over to Hugh, I want to again acknowledge the hard work of all our employees throughout this year. They have worked tirelessly to satisfy our customers and consumers, and I\\'m extremely proud of the dedication and efforts., employee dedication,\\ncustomer satisfaction, consumer needs, hard work, effort, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. As Ramon mentioned earlier, our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to retail closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19. In addition, our business experienced higher labor, personal protective equipment, logistics and service costs associated with COVID-19. These costs coupled with an adverse channel mix shift in key markets impacted our operating margin in the second quarter., COVID-19 disruptions,\\nretail closures, labor costs, logistics costs, channel mix shift, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, We expect some of these costs to persist and remain committed to making the necessary long-term investments to support our employees and customers, while also investing in capabilities that drive competitive advantages for our business. To mitigate some of these challenges, we\\'ve accelerated our efforts to control what we can. This includes tightly managing our discretionary expenses, reducing non-essential advertising and marketing spend to reflect the realities of the current environment and optimizing our pricing wherever possible. We have also reduced the complexity of our product offerings by prioritizing high-velocity SKUs to maximize production capacity., cost management, investment, advertising spend, pricing optimization, product complexity, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, However, it remains difficult to predict exactly how consumer habits and macroeconomic conditions will evolve for the balance of this year. Based on what we can currently project for the full year 2020, we continue to expect our annual core effective tax rate to be approximately 21%; total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion, comprised of dividends of $5.5 billion and share repurchases of $2 billion; and we now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact our reported revenue and core EPS by 3 percentage points based on current market consensus rates. Our expected cash returns reflect a 7% increase in the annualized dividend per share that began in June. This represented the company\\'s 48th consecutive annual dividend per share increase., consumer habits, macroeconomic conditions, tax rate, cash returns, foreign exchange translation, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Hugh F.

Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Now, as we look ahead to our third quarter, we expect our organic revenue to increase within a low-single digit range, which incorporates the geographic perspectives and channel dynamics that Ramon referenced earlier. We expect our core operating margin to contract, albeit at a less severe rate than what we experienced during the second quarter, as greater costs associated with keeping our employees safe persist. And we expect foreign exchange translation headwinds to negatively impact our net revenue and core earnings per share performance by 3 percentage points., organic revenue, core\\noperating margin, foreign exchange translation, employee safety, channel dynamics, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2020, 2, Hugh F.

This reflects changes made to our management reporting structure. Therefore, certain international division results have been restated for the full years 2017, 2018 and 2019. Specifically, our former Europe Sub-Saharan Africa division has been reclassified as Europe and will no longer include Sub-Saharan Africa. And our former Asia, Middle East, North Africa division has been reclassified into two divisions: Africa, Middle East, South Asia, or AMESA; and Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, China, or APAC. There are no changes to the remaining divisions or our consolidated results., international divisions,\\nmanagement reporting structure, restated results, division reclassification, AMESA division, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President, And now it\\'s my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta., Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo\\nCEO, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, Ravi, and good morning, everybody. Approximately about a year ago, we embarked on a plan to make PepsiCo Faster, Stronger and Better. We\\'ve made very good progress against these initiatives, and I\\'m pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of the full year financial targets that we communicated to you about a year ago. Most notably, organic revenue growth accelerated to 4.5% in 2019, our fastest rate of growth since 2015. Our organic revenue growth was very broad-based across all divisions, with Frito-Lay delivering its fastest rate of growth since 2013 and PBNA delivered its fastest rate of growth since 2015. Our developing and emerging markets also delivered high single-digit growth despite ongoing volatility and uncertainty in certain parts of the world. We invested in becoming Faster by increasing our global advertising and marketing spending by more than 12% for the full year, reflecting investment across snacks and beverages, and in both our large and established brands and our emerging brands; expanding our market presence by increasing route capacity, adding merchandising racks and coolers and advancing the technologies that we deploy to drive greater and more precise execution; and investing in additional manufacturing capacity to remove bottlenecks and increase growth capacity for our products. This includes investments in new plants, new lines and added distribution infrastructure., PepsiCo, Frito-Lay, PBNA, advertising and marketing\\nspending, emerging markets, developing markets, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Whilst we intend to continue to invest back into our business, we know that sustaining higher growth would require building stronger capabilities, ones which will be difficult to match by our competitors. During 2019, we enhanced our consumer and customer-facing capabilities, strengthened our organizational culture and transformed our cost management. Specifically, we invested in data analytics and other information technology to build consumer intimacy and achieve precision at scale. By capturing and analyzing more granular consumer-level data, we can understand the consumer in a more individualized way to both customize communication and executing in every store with precisely the right products placed in the right location and at the right price. We strengthened our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce, but our retail sales were nearly $2 billion in 2019. To meet the growing need across channels for greater customization and faster innovation, we\\'re investing in an end-to-end agile value chain that can deliver more precision and variety to enable us to win in the marketplace., PepsiCo, consumer intimacy, data analytics, IT, omnichannel\\ncapabilities, agile value chain, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We migrated our organizational structure closer to the market in order to improve speed, increase accountability and become more locally focused. And we evolved our way our values and ways of working to foster a culture where employees act like owners with a greater sense of empowerment and accountability. We call this The PepsiCo Way, which includes a set of seven leadership behaviors that have been rapidly embraced by our organization. And we took a completely holistic approach to cost management, one in which we manage all costs as an investment. In doing so, we challenged the entire cost structure to evaluate cost and benefit of our spending. In 2019, we delivered in excess of $1 billion in productivity savings and plan to deliver this amount annually through 2023., PepsiCo, organizational structure, values and ways of\\nworking, leadership behaviors, cost management, productivity savings, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Finally, becoming Better reflects our aspiration to continually integrate purpose into our business strategy and brands as more is expected of corporations by society. We prioritized and embraced a set of focused initiatives to help build a more sustainable food system. These include advancing benefits to farmers and communities through more sustainable agriculture. We intend to achieve 100% sustainably farmer-sourced agricultural raw materials by the end of 2020, which include potatoes, whole corn, oats and oranges. Improving water stewardship. We\\'re striving to improve water use sufficiency and aiming to replenish 100% of the water we consume for manufacturing in high water risk areas by 2025., PepsiCo, sustainability, agriculture, water stewardship,\\npurpose-driven business strategy, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Circular packaging. By 2025, we intend to increase recycled content in our plastics packaging to 25% and reduce 35% of virgin plastic content across all our beverage portfolio. Improving choices across our portfolio by reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fats. Mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions across PepsiCo\\'s value chain by 20% by 2030. And finally, advancing respect for human rights, promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace and increase the earnings potential earnings potential of women to drive economic growth and increased food security. Our commitment to becoming Better was most notably demonstrated by appointing our first-ever Chief Sustainability Officer and by a green bond offering that generated almost $1 billion in net proceeds to advance our sustainability agenda., circular packaging, recycled content, reduced virgin\\nplastic, climate change, human rights, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, To complement our Faster, Stronger and Better initiatives, we also made investments to fortify our portfolio for future growth. Specifically, we invested in our SodaStream business, which grew net revenue more than 20% last year in order to capture an incremental growth opportunity. We announced our intent to acquire BFY Brands, the makers of the fast-growing PopCorners brand, which will enhance our premium snack portfolio. We\\'re in the process of acquiring Pioneer Foods, which will build the foundation for future growth and scale in Africa, a key emerging market where our growth opportunities remain vast. And we acquired CytoSport, the makers of Muscle Milk, which expands our presence in sports nutrition, providing opportunities for additional growth and category expansion. As we aspire to be the global leader in convenient foods and beverages by winning with purpose, we believe these investments position us well to win in the marketplace., Fortifying portfolio, growth opportunities, emerging\\nmarkets, acquisitions, sports nutrition, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Now let me discuss our operating results. As I noted earlier, our organic revenue growth accelerated to 4.5% for the full year 2019 versus 3.7% in 2018, exceeding the initial target we set a year ago. All our divisions contributed to this growth, including a 3% increase in developed markets and an 8% increase in developing and emerging markets. Frito-Lay North America had a very strong year with a 4.5% increase in organic revenue, along with an acceleration of volume growth in the second half of the year. The business gained value share in both salty and savory snacks in 2019 and improved its customer service levels. Frito\\'s results were driven by the investments we made in innovation, marketing and consumer insights, supply chain and manufacturing and go-to-market capacity. This included a double-digit increase in advertising and marketing spend, additional plant, warehouse and distribution center capacity, and additional routes, racks and selling resources., Revenue growth, Organic revenue growth, Frito-Lay North America,\\nInnovation, Marketing and consumer insights, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Frito delivered net revenue growth in all of its large mainstream brands like Lay\\'s, Doritos, Tostitos, Cheetos, Ruffles and Fritos and double-digit growth in emerging premium brands such as Bare and Off the Eaten Path. Our multipack offerings also delivered very good growth as we have continuously expanded the variety of brand and flavor combinations. The breadth of our growth was also evident across every key retail channel. We increased net revenue growth in grocery, mass, club, convenience, foodservice and e-commerce. And Frito-Lay was once again the #1 contributor to U.S. food and beverage retail sales growth in 2019. With respect to the fourth quarter, Frito delivered 3% organic revenue growth, driven by 2% volume growth and 1% net price realization. The deceleration in net price realization was largely a function of the timing of pricing actions taken in 2018. We expect our net price realization trends to improve over the coming months and have strong innovation and merchandising plans in place for the business to deliver very good growth in 2020., Revenue growth, Organic revenue growth, Frito-Lay, Innovation, Retail\\nchannels, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, PepsiCo Beverages North America delivered 3% organic revenue growth in 2019 with a sequential acceleration in the fourth quarter, which represented its fastest rate of organic revenue growth in four years. The business benefited from improved local market focus and execution driven by our new field structure, increased go-to-market capacity, significantly stepped up advertising support, innovation and additional selling resources. We also invested in improving our presence in the away-from-home channel by becoming the preferred beverage partner for JetBlue, Carnival Cruise Lines and Regal Cinemas for the past year. Investing in our brands has been a big focus area for PBNA\\'s advertising and marketing spend, increasing in a double-digit range for both the fourth quarter and full year with increases in our large brands, such as Pepsi, Gatorade and Mountain Dew., Organic revenue growth, Advertising and marketing spend, Innovation, Go-to-\\nmarket capacity, Away-from-home channel, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Trademark Pepsi posted its sixth consecutive quarter of net revenue growth with strong double-digit growth in our Pepsi Zero Sugar product. Gatorade accelerated as the year progressed and ended the year on a very strong note with high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by Gatorade Zero, which delivered more than $600 million in measured retail sales in 2019. Innovation played a very important role at PBNA this year with Gatorade Zero, bubly and Mountain Dew Game Fuel having cumulatively delivered more than $1 billion in measured retail sales. Other brands, including Propel and Lifewater delivered strong double-digit net revenue growth, while Pure Leaf and Starbucks delivered high single-digit growth in 2019., Organic revenue growth, Innovation, Advertising and marketing spend, Retail\\nsales, Brands, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Finally, we have plans in place to build on our recent innovation successes. We will invest in BOLT24, a functional beverage we launched last year that supports athletes around the clock by providing advanced, all-day hydration. We recently introduced Zero Sugar variants of Mountain Dew and Mountain Dew Game Fuel, which offer the same bold taste as the originals without the sugar. And we will roll out Pepsi Cafe, a coffee-infused cola beverage that will be available for a limited-time offering in U.S. stores as of April. Rounding out our North America performance. Quaker Foods delivered 1% organic revenue growth for the full year, with double-digit net revenue growth in our light snacks business and Gamesa cookies and mid-single-digit growth at Aunt Jemima and Roni., Innovation, BOLT24, Zero Sugar variants,\\nPepsi Cafe, Quaker Foods, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, I want to conclude our discussion on North America by acknowledging terrific work of our customer and supply chain teams have done. Specifically, PepsiCo was awarded the number one ranking in the 2019 Kantar PowerRanking survey, the fourth consecutive year we\\'ve claimed the top spot; and the top two rankings in 2019 U.S. Advantage survey core food multichannel report. These surveys reflect our customers\\' view of PepsiCo as a valued partner and demonstrate the benefits of investing with our customers to help drive growth. Now moving on to international markets. Each of our international divisions delivered strong organic revenue growth in 2019. These results include some performance across our developing and emerging markets, with high single-digit organic revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year., Customer teams, Supply chain, Kantar\\nPowerRanking survey, U.S. Advantage survey, International markets, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We continue to have a long runway for growth in many international markets, and our results reflect the benefits of our increased investments as we continue to leverage our global capabilities to drive higher per capital consumption and improve market share, while executing in locally relevant ways. In Latin America, we grew organic revenue growth we grew organic revenue 7% for the full year, with growth in both snacks and beverages despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility and political uncertainty in certain markets. Mexico, our largest market, delivered high single-digit growth for both the quarter and the full year. Our next largest market, Brazil, delivered mid-single-digit growth for the full year with an acceleration in the fourth quarter to high single-digit growth., Organic revenue growth, Latin America,\\nSnacks, Beverages, Macroeconomic volatility, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, In Europe, we grew organic revenue 5.5% for the full year, with very good growth both in snacks and beverages. Our largest market, Russia, delivered mid-single-digit growth for the fourth quarter and the full year. The United Kingdom delivered low single-digit growth for the full year. But very encouragingly, it exited the year with mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Other highlights include double-digit growth in Turkey and high single-digit growth in Poland for the full year. Moving to our Asia, Middle East and Africa regions. During the fourth quarter, we took the opportunity to think more strategically about this part of the world. We decided to split the organizational structure of our prior AMENA division into AMESA, which includes Africa, Middle East and South Asia; and APAC, which includes Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand and China. By creating one operating sector centered on the Asian consumer and another centered on the Middle Eastern, South Asian and African consumer, we believe we can enhance our focus on accelerating top line growth., Organic revenue growth, Europe, Snacks,\\nBeverages, Russia, United Kingdom, Turkey, Poland, Asia, Middle East, Africa, AMESA, APAC, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, AMESA delivered 6% organic revenue growth for the full year. This includes double-digit growth in Pakistan and Egypt and mid-single-digit growth in India and Saudi Arabia. APAC delivered 9% organic revenue growth for the full year, led by strong double-digit growth in China and Vietnam and high single-digit growth in Thailand and the Philippines. To conclude, our priorities for 2020 remain consistent with our discussions today. We expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency earnings-per-share growth in 2020. And we will continue to invest back into the business to evolve our portfolio and transform our value chain; build next-generation capabilities, particularly leveraging technology to enhance our insights, speed and precision; grow our talent and simplify our organization to be more consumer and customer-centric; invest in our brands, both large and emerging; and reduce our cost structure to free up resources to fund our investments. These priorities will always be executed with an eye toward enhancing our marketplace competitiveness and delivering, of course, long-term value creation., Organic revenue growth, AMESA, APAC,\\nPakistan, Egypt, India, Saudi Arabia, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Great. Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. As Ramon noted, for 2020, we expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency earnings-per-share growth. We expect foreign exchange to have an approximately negative 1 % point impact on net revenue and core EPS growth and, therefore, expect our core U.S. dollar EPS to be $5.88 in 2020. For 2020, we also expect our core annual core effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, reflecting capex of approximately $5 billion. The higher rate of capital spending is associated with accelerating progress on our strategic growth priorities, as Ramon laid out earlier. We expect our capital spending to remain at or around these levels for the next few years and now expected to moderate to 5% of sales by 2023. We expect total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion in 2020, comprised of dividends of $5.5 billion and share repurchases of $2 billion. The expected cash returns reflect a 7% increase in the annualized dividend per share effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2020. This will represent the company\\'s 48th consecutive annual dividend per share increase., Revenue\\nGrowth, Earnings Per Share, Tax Rate, Capital Spending, Cash Returns, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 4, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, With respect to your models, please keep in mind the following: In the first quarter of 2020, we face a difficult comparison for both organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit growth at Frito-Lay North America and our international divisions. With that, now we\\'ll open it up for your questions. Operator, we\\'ll take the first question., Revenue\\nGrowth, Earnings Per Share, Tax Rate, Capital Spending, Cash Returns, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 1, Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I\\'m joined this morning by PepsiCo\\'s Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo\\'s Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We\\'ll begin today\\'s call with some brief prepared comments from Ramon and Hugh and then we\\'ll open the call up to your questions. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement.

When discussing our financial results on today\\'s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures which exclude certain items from our reported results. Such items include the impacts of certain tax related matters, foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other changes, and restructuring charges.

Good morning, everyone. About two months ago we shared with you in some detail our priorities for the business and our financial goals for 2019. So today we\\'re keeping our prepared comments short, just touching on the highlights for the quarter and then we will leave enough time to get to all your questions. I will start by simply saying that we\\'re very pleased with our results for the first quarter. Our rate of organic revenue growth accelerated to 5.2%, our highest rate of quarterly growth in more than three years. This topline performance was broad based with particularly strong organic revenue growth at Frito-Lay North America, which grew 6%; and our international divisions, while negatively affecting our reported basis by ForEx and refranchising, delivered organic revenue growth of 8% in ESSA and 10% in both Latin America and AMENA. We also had solid growth and continued progress at PepsiCo Beverages North America where organic revenue was up 2% -- 2.5% in the quarter., Revenue Growth, Organic Revenue\\nGrowth, International Divisions, PepsiCo Beverages North America, ForEx, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 1, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We invested as planned across our businesses and this included a double-digit increase in advertising and marketing. And our productivity and restructuring actions were implemented according to plan. Our strong performance in the quarter is emblematic of a number of key strengths in the business. Amongst them, the health and resilience of our categories, our leading brands, a broad-based portfolio capable of evolving to satisfy consumer tastes, a well-developed geographic footprint with strong positions in our largest markets, suite of strong and relevant capabilities across the value chain, scale that allow us to run our operations very efficiently, and of course our highly engaged and motivated associates. We execute every day in a way that enables us to win in the marketplace. So with strong start to the year and one quarter under our belt, we remain confident in achieving the 2019 financial goals we shared with you two months ago., Strong Performance, Investment, Productivity and Restructuring Actions, Key Strengths, Confidence in Financial Goals, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 1, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Looking ahead, we\\'re staying focused on the priorities we shared with you in February; namely to accelerate our topline growth in a sustainable way, to compete more effectively to win in our -- in most of our markets, and more rapidly evolve our capabilities to widen our advantages versus the competition. To achieve these objectives, we\\'re focused on becoming faster, stronger, and better. We\\'ll become faster by being more consumer-centric and accelerating investment for topline growth and winning in the marketplace. This means broadening our portfolio and packaging formats to win locally, fortifying our North American business -- businesses by investing in Frito-Lay North America and PepsiCo Beverages North America, and accelerating our international expansion with a disciplined focus on right to win markets. We\\'ll become stronger by transforming our capabilities and our culture., Faster, Stronger, Better, Consumer-Centric, International Expansion, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 1, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This means driving savings through holistic cost management to reinvest in the marketplace; developing and scaling the core capabilities necessary to better understand and meet new consumer trends, strengthen our brands, and improve customer service; and building a differentiated organization, talent base, and culture. And finally, we\\'ll become better by integrating our purpose agenda into our business strategy with a particular focus on four critical initiatives. First, advancing farming practices to optimize crop yields, protect human rights, improve farmer livelihoods, and secure supply. Second, replenishing more water than we use in water stressed areas. Third, creating a circular economy for plastics. And fourth, increasing the appeal of our products by reducing added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats and adding more positive ingredients. The entire organization from the Board to our frontline is moving forward with urgency and we look forward to updating you on our progress as the year progresses., Driving Savings, Developing\\nCapabilities, Building a Differentiated Organization, Advancing Farming Practices, Increasing Appeal of Products, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 1, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Great. Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. I have just a few comments on the balance of your outlook. As we mentioned in the release, we are reiterating each of the components of our 2019 guidance. Namely, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 4%, a core effective tax rate of approximately 21%. core constant currency EPS to decline approximately 1%, free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, and total cash return to shareholders of approximately $8 billion comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3 billion. With both organic revenue growth and core constant currency EPS growth higher in Q1 than in our full-year targets, that implies the growth rate for the balance of the year will be below the Q1 growth rates. So, let me address how you should think about that starting with the topline. First, the rate of organic revenue growth at FLNA in Q1 was extraordinary., Organic Revenue Growth, Core\\nEffective Tax Rate, Core Constant Currency EPS, Free Cash Flow, Total Cash Return to\\nShareholders, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 1, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, We don\\'t expect that rate of growth to continue for the balance of the year. And second, Q1 represented our easiest lap of the year so balance of year laps will be more difficult, especially in the back half of the year. From an EPS perspective, you should consider the following: One, in Q1 we had the benefit of lapping the one-time frontline bonus from 2018 and we also benefited from approximately $50 million of insurance recoveries in the current year. Two, over the balance of the year, we will be lapping gains from various strategic asset sales and refranchising gains and insurance recoveries most notably in Q2. Three, our rate of net commodity inflation, which includes the impact of transactional foreign exchange, is expected to accelerate in the second quarter. And finally, our pace of planned reinvestments will accelerate over the course of the year and you will see this reflected both in core EPS as well as in our operating margin performance., Easy Lap, Lapping Gains, Net\\nCommodity Inflation, Planned Reinvestments, Second Quarter, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2019, 1, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Now, we\\'ll open it up for your questions. Operator, we\\'ll take the first question., First Question, Operator, Questions, Open It Up, Take The First Question, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I\\'m joined this morning by PepsiCo\\'s Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo\\'s Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnston. We\\'ll begin with approximately 25 minutes of prepared comments from Ramon and Hugh, and then open the call up to your questions. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement., Prepared Comments, Cautionary\\nStatement, Questions, Begin, Approximately, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2019 guidance and long-term targets, based on currently available information.

We\\'ll begin this morning\\'s call with a brief recap of 2018 performance, and then move on to a discussion at -- of go-forward priorities, long-term targets and the financial outlook for 2019. So let\\'s begin with 2018, which was a very successful year. We met or exceeded each of the financial targets we outlined at the beginning of the year., 2018 Performance, Go-Forward\\nPriorities, Long-Term Targets, Financial Outlook, Successful Year, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Organic revenue grew 3.7%, which was a meaningful sequential acceleration from 2017. And within the year, we saw the rate of growth accelerate from 2.5% in the first half to 4.7% in the second half.\\xa0\\xa0Purely North America and each one of the international divisions performed very well, and NAV made progress throughout the year with a return to organic revenue growth and improved pricing. At the same time, we continued to make investments in the business, and the solid momentum we have as we enter 2019 is a good indication that those investments are working. Now on to priorities., Organic Revenue, Sequential\\nAcceleration, Pricing, Investments, Momentum, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As most of you know, I assumed the role of CEO in early October, and I\\'m pleased to report that the transition has gone very well. And I\\'m fortunate step into the role at such a well-positioned company. PepsiCo competes in attractive, large and growing categories. We\\'ve been leading -- we have leading brands and a broad portfolio capable of evolving into new growth spaces., Transition, Company Position, Leading Brands, Growth Spaces, New Growth, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We have a very well-developed geographic footprint, with a stronghold positions in our largest markets and very competitive positions in a number of other rapidly growing markets. We have a suite of strong and very relevant capabilities across the value chain that we\\'ve been -- that have been built and strengthened over the years.\\xa0We have scale that allows us to run our operations very efficiently and to leverage our capability investments across a large and global business. We have highly engaged associates, a strong cohesive management team and deep talent bench. And we have a distinct winning culture that has its -- at its foundation, well embodied values and a strong sense of purpose., Geographic Footprint, Capabilities, Efficient Operations, Engaged Associates, Winning Culture, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, These traits have enabled us to perform well in an environment characterized by highly dynamic retail and competitive landscapes, shifting consumer habits and preferences, and volatile currencies, commodities and geopolitics. Over the past six years, organic revenue growth has averaged 3.8%. Core operating margin has expanded by 1.6 percentage points. Core constant currency earnings-per-share growth has averaged 9%., Dynamic Retail, Shifting\\nConsumer Habits, Volatile Currencies, Commodities, Geopolitics, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Core ROIC has expanded by 9.5 percentage points to 24.8%. Dividends per share have grown 9% on a compound basis. And we\\'re returning $45 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. I\\'ve spended the past four months deeply engaged in the business, connecting with our consumers, our customers and associates, as well as spending considerable time together as a senior leadership team, having no holds barred debates with a goal of focusing on what the opportunities are to make our company even faster, stronger and better., Core ROIC, Dividends, Returning Money to Shareholders, Senior Leadership Team, Opportunities, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We looked for opportunities to improve our strategies, our portfolio of businesses, the strength and breadth of our capabilities, how we organize and get work done, how we can take our execution to new heights and how we can elevate our sense of purpose.\\xa0And from this review and assessment, we emerged with a set of what I\\'ll call observation and a very clear set of go-forward priorities. Let me begin with the observations. Fundamentally, we\\'re a highly focused convenient food and beverage company. We compete in very attractive, large, growing and highly complementary categories that share many common characteristics, including consumers, customers, shoppers and occasions., Observations, Priorities, Focused Company, Attractive Categories, Common Characteristics, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our ability to leverage the scale of our business to invest in and deploy new capabilities and technologies is a competitive advantage. Furthermore, we have tremendous potential to expand consumption across multiple dimensions. We believe we can capture a greater share of consumption occasions by considering to broaden our portfolio to provide greater choice to satisfy consumers evolving taste, whether they are seeking for an indulgent treat or a more nutritious snack, hydration or a functional drink, on-the-go convenience or take-home value. And we also see the opportunity to continue to increase consumers perceived visibility of our products as an additional growth avenue.\\xa0Relatedly, we believe our product and geographic portfolios make sense., Leveraging Scale, Expanding\\nConsumption, Broadening Portfolio, Increasing Visibility, Sense of Products, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And we do not currently see the need to shed or acquire businesses in any significant way. Those businesses are not squarely on strategy, are relatively small and generate very healthy cash flows. And there is no apparent value-creating path to divest them because of tax consequences and/or transaction complexity. Let me go now into our individual businesses., Healthy Cash Flows, Tax\\nConsequences, Transaction Complexity, Individual Businesses, No Need to Divest, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frito-Lay in North America, our largest sector by profit, is an extremely strong businesses -- strong business that generates consistently attractive top-line growth and has industry-leading margins and returns on invested capital. The core of Fritos business remains very strong and growing. Over the years, Frito has successfully adopted its portfolio to address new demand spaces, mainly in more permissible and premium snacking. We\\'ve added new brands and product lines to capitalize on those opportunities, with products like simply, SunChips, Smartfood, Off the Eaten Path and Imagine., Strong Business, Industry-\\nLeading Margins, Growing Core, New Demand Spaces, Adding Brands, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And we expect this approach will enable Frito to continue to compete very effectively across the spectrum of the snacks category.\\xa0\\xa0Furthermore, we see more runway to continue to source volume from other micro snacks occasions in what that played to Fritos strengths -- in ways that play to Frito\\'s strength. Operationally, Frito runs extremely efficient and highly optimized supply chain and go-to-market systems. However, capacity utilization is very high on average and there are pockets where capacity is overstretched. We believe with added capacity, Frito will be even better positioned to capture new growth opportunities., Competitive Effectiveness, Sourcing Volume, Operational Efficiency, Capacity Utilization, Added Capacity, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Let me move now to North America Beverages. NAB, our largest sector by revenue, is an attractive business. It has many leading brands in growing beverage categories and operates a differentiated integrated business model. We believe our operating model is a competitive advantage that provides superior customer and system alignment, speed to market and systemwide efficiency., Leading Brands, Growing\\nCategories, Differentiated Model, Competitive Advantage, Systemwide Efficiency, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, With that said, in a dynamic market, NAB has faced a number of challenges over the past 18 months. New entrants have come to market in some of our stronghold categories. There are opportunities to improve some of our brand marketing and consumer engagement. And there are areas where we can step up our local marketplace execution.\\xa0We have good plans in place to address these opportunities., Challenges, New Entrants, Brand Marketing, Consumer Engagement, Local Marketplace Execution, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve increased both the quality and level of A&M on key core brands, including Pepsi and Mountain Dew. We\\'ve increased our innovation to address new category entrants and to drive success in higher growth segments, with innovations like LIFEWTR, bubly, Gatorade Zero, new variants of Propel and extensions within our successful Starbucks and pure life -- Pure Leaf Tea guidance. At the same time, we\\'re having good success with Pepsi Zero Sugar, and this has been a key element in stabilizing the performance of our trademark Pepsi business. And we\\'re making changes to our NAB organization structure and adding frontline resources to make us a more agile and respondent to local commercial opportunities and local competitive actions., Increased Quality, Innovation, New Category Entrants, Successful Brands, Organization Structure, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, While there is more work to do, we\\'re very encouraged by this steady sequential improvement we\\'ve seen in the business. We are confident that with more well-placed investments, we\\'ll see continued improvement in any of these performance.\\xa0Let me talk a bit about international now. We have a very well developed international footprint, and our international businesses are performing very well. We have strong market positions in snacks globally and within most of our key markets., Steady Improvement, Well-Placed\\nInvestments, Strong Market Positions, International Footprint, Key Markets, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And in beverages, we have very competitive market positions, either outright or in combination with our bottling partners who provide scale and round out our beverage product portfolio. In most of our key markets, we\\'re the No. 1 or No. 2 overall food and beverage supplier., Competitive Market Positions, Scale, Product Portfolio, Key Markets, Food and Beverage Supplier, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our categories travel well. And we had success innovating and marketing in ways that make our products highly relevant at a local level. We have a very well qualified playbook to expand our business in developing and emerging markets by exploiting our global capabilities to grow penetration and frequency. A key element of the playbook is lifting and shifting our ideas from market to market, still that we continue to hold., Travel Well, Innovation, Local\\nRelevance, Global Capabilities, Lifting and Shifting, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We believe with greater focus on capability deployments, increasing the local relevance of our products and achieving greater scale, our international business, especially in D&E markets, can be a source of even greater growth and higher profitability.\\xa0Underpinning all we do is our commitment to a strong environmental, social and governance agenda. Our sense of purpose is a great inspiration to our associates and makes us a very attractive place to build a career. Furthermore, we understand that we\\'re an integral member of the communities we operate in. We embrace the notion that we can and should make big positive impacts in our communities by leveraging our scale and deploying our capabilities to help our communities strive., Greater Focus, Local Relevance, International Business, Environmental Social Governance, Community Impact, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We believe a strong ESG agenda is fundamental to long-term value creation. Our dedication to environmental, social and governance leadership will not waver. So with these observations in mind, let me move on to our priorities. Our first set of priorities relates to becoming faster, specifically, accelerating our rate of organic revenue growth., Environmental Social Governance, Long-Term Value Creation, Priorities, Faster Growth, Organic Revenue Growth, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And if there\\'s one thing I\\'d like you to take from our discussion today is that, we view topline acceleration as the single biggest opportunity to create more shareholder value. To achieve accelerated topline growth, we intend to strengthen and broaden our product portfolio packaging formats to win locally in convenient foods and beverages. And this means growing our core businesses as we continue to evolve our product portfolio and sharpening our focus on key geographies.\\xa0Across snacks and beverages, we\\'ll invest to capture a greater share of consumption occasions, from indulgent to functional, social to individual, value to premium, and across dayparts from morning to night. We plan to do this by continuing to grow our core brands, which include $22 billion brands, and building and/or acquiring new brands to cover new demand spaces, as we have recently done with bubly, LIFEWTR, update in Path or Bare., Accelerated Growth, Product\\nPortfolio, Packaging Formats, Geographies, Brand Building, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Within snacks, we intend to further capitalize on the consumer trends of convenience and on-the-go in locally relevant ways. Here, we see themes of convenient mini meals, local street foods and local recipes, just a few inspirations to evolve our portfolio in very locally relevant ways. We intend to rapidly scale our beyond the bottle initiative, building on the foundations of our recent acquisition of SodaStream and our internally developed Spire, Drinkfinity and Aquafina water station platforms to offer consumers even greater variety and choice in beverage formats. From a geographic perspective, our priorities are clear: No,., Convenience, On-The-Go, Locally Relevant, Beverage Formats, Geographic Priorities, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 1, invest to sustain Frito-Lay North America\\'s growth and leadership; No. 2, strengthen North America Beverages to grow sustainably with the market; and third, accelerate our international expansion with a disciplined focus on right to win markets.\\xa0Across each of these initiatives, we\\'ll deploy a simple, clear and very effective growth model that\\'s highly focused on the consumer. That is providing the consumer four key benefits: variety, that is what I want; ubiquity, where I want it; desirability, from a brand I trust; and value, with the benefits or affordability that appeals to me. Our entire commercial agenda is centered on delivering these four benefits to the consumer., Investment, Growth Model, Consumer Benefits, International Expansion, Disciplined Focus, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our second set of priorities relates to becoming stronger. This involves becoming more capable, leaner, more agile and less bureaucratic. In doing so, we will drive down cost and that enables us to plow the savings back into the business to develop scale and sharpen core capabilities that drive even greater efficiency and effectiveness creating a virtuous cycle. Our productivity programs will be guided by a set of universally applied principles, namely: achieving local affordability; simplifying and standardizing processes; collaborating across functions rather than optimizing within functions to achieve lowest cost end-to-end processes; relentlessly automating and merging the best of our optimized business models with the best new thinking and technologies.\\xa0Just as importantly, we\\'re also adopting a philosophy that recognizes that not all the capabilities or costs are equal, so we\\'ll be very discriminating in where we need to pay for best-in-class or we should pay for just good enough., Becoming Stronger, Productivity\\nPrograms, Local Affordability, Simplifying Processes, Discriminating Capabilities, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, These principles will be applied across the entire cost structure, from labor to discretionary costs, and advertising and marketing, to fixed assets.The savings from our productivity programs will be substantially reinvested to develop and scale a set of core capabilities that we believe are necessary to deliver the consumer benefits I mentioned earlier. These capabilities are: indispensable brand building; science and design-led innovation; point of choice excellence across all channels, whether traditional or emerging; consumer intimacy, that is leveraging technology and connecting data to deepen our relationships with consumers, moving from relationships with groups of consumers to relationships with individual consumers. This enables a number of benefits, from individually based media and marketing engagement to personalized pricing; and finally, supply chain agility, where we deploy integrated and more robust data to improve demand forecasting and automation, advance robotics and other technology to make our manufacturing assets and go-to-market systems much more flexible to satisfy that demand with greater speed, precision and efficiency.\\xa0And of course, executing this aggressive agenda of top-line acceleration productivity and capability building will require fostering a high-performance culture, one that is aligned on a common set of leadership behaviors and is supported by the right incentive systems. Among the values we are emphasizing throughout the organization are being more center on the consumer, acting like owners, and moving with focus and speed., Cost Structure, Productivity\\nPrograms, Reinvested Savings, Core Capabilities, High-Performance Culture, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And finally, we\\'re examining ways to refine our incentive and pay systems to encourage local empowerment and accountability, as well as even greater alignment between management, our shareholders. And our third and final objective relates to being a better company, with -- by being purpose-led. Performance with Purpose has been a cornerstone of PepsiCo for 12 years. Its guided our strategy and has been a point of differentiation., Incentive Systems, Local\\nEmpowerment, Alignment, Purpose-Led, Performance with Purpose, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re very proud of the progress we\\'ve made to date and equally excited about the continued evolution of our purpose agenda. With this in mind, our organization is committing to winning with purpose, which marks a new chapter in our purpose agenda. It acknowledges PepsiCo\\'s leadership in integrating sustainability with a strive for more than a decade and conveys our belief that sustainability can be an even greater contributor to our success in the marketplace.\\xa0Essential to our winning with purpose agenda will be a sharpened focus on advancing sustainability -- advance in sustainable agricultural practices, a holistic strategy to support the creation of a circle or plastic economy, a striving for positive water impact and continuing to make our products more permissible to consumers. As we work to execute each one of these priorities, our overarching goal is to accelerate the rate of topline growth to enable us to deliver balanced, sustainable financial performance that creates greater long-term sharehold value., Winning with Purpose, Sustainability Agenda, Advancing Sustainable Agriculture, Circle of Plastic Economy, Positive Water Impact, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, With that, now let me hand it over to Hugh to cover the financial goals in more detail., Financial Goals, Handover, Coverage, Detailed Analysis, PepsiCo\\'s Leadership, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Great. Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. The plans Ramon just laid out are intended to create durable, attractive long-term financial performance and total shareholder returns, driven by organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%, 20 to 30 basis points of average annual core operating margin expansion, high single-digit core constant currency EPS growth, growing core net returns on invested capital, and attractive free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders. To support our free cash flow and core net ROIC goals, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation with our existing priorities intact, namely: No., Durable Financial Performance, Total Shareholder Returns, Organic Revenue Growth, Core Operating Margin Expansion, Disciplined Capital Allocation, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, 1, investing in the business; No.2, paying a dividend; No. 3, tuck-in acquisitions; and No.4, returning residual cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Productivity is a key component of our go-forward plans, providing both fuel for reinvestment and improving our operating margins. We\\'re extending our productivity savings target of more than $1 billion annually through 2023., Investing in Business, Dividend\\nPayments, Tuck-in Acquisitions, Residual Cash Return, Productivity Savings, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Contributing to this goal are savings we expect from restructuring actions we announced in this morning\\'s release.\\xa0We intend to make substantial investments in the business in 2019 in A&M, manufacturing and go-to-market capacity, end-to-end supply chain transformation, and global systems harmonization and standardization. While there are investments in each category in each operating sector, in terms of emphasis, in Frito-Lay North America and our international sectors, there is relatively greater emphasis on adding manufacturing and go-to-market capacity and supply chain transformation. In the case of North America Beverages, there is relatively greater emphasis on investing to support the core brands, ramped up innovation, and adding and redirecting resources to drive enhanced local marketplace execution. And across all the sectors, as well as at the corporate center, we\\'re investing to drive global systems harmonization and standardization., Restructuring Actions, Investments in Business, Supply Chain Transformation, Global Systems Harmonization, Local\\nMarketplace Execution, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, These investments are being made with the aim of building the capabilities and implementing the processes that will support the achievement of the strategic priorities Ramon just reviewed, especially the achievement of sustained accelerated topline performance. We deeply analyze and assess each of the planned investments. We\\'ve established detailed guidepost to measure our progress and success against each one. And we\\'re confident that the investments will return meaningful value to investors over time.\\xa0Beyond the stepped-up investments, our 2019 core earnings performance will be impacted by three other factors: first, we\\'re lapping a number of strategic asset sale and refranchising gains and insurance recoveries net of a front-line bonus that contributed approximately $0.17 to earnings in 2018; second, we expect the core tax rate to increase to approximately 21% in 2019 from a rate of 18.8% in 2018; and third, we expect foreign exchange translation to be an approximate 2-percentage-point headwind to both revenue and EPS performance in 2019., Investment Analysis, Strategic\\nPriorities, Measure Progress, Return Value, Foreign Exchange Translation, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Taking all of this together, for 2019, we expect organic revenue growth of 4% and core EPS of approximately $5.50. Importantly, we expect to see a return to high single-digit core constant currency EPS growth in 2020. For 2019, we also expect free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a step-up in CAPEX to approximately $4.5 billion. Most of the increased capital spending is associated with accelerating progress on our strategic priorities., Organic Revenue Growth, Core\\nEPS, Free Cash Flow, Strategic Priorities, CAPEX, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 4, Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Following 2019, we expect our capital spending to moderate and to return to approximately 5% of revenue by 2022.\\xa0We expect total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8 billion in 2019, comprised with dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3 billion.

This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2018 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted.

And good morning, everyone. Thank you, all for joining us. As most of you know, we announced in August that I\\'m stepping down as CEO of PepsiCo after 12 years in the role, effective tomorrow. And so, today will be my final conference call with you. Actually, my 75th and final if you also include the calls I participated in as CFO. After we complete the primary business at hand, reviewing the results and taking your questions, I\\'d like to ask for your patience and allow me to make a few concluding remarks at the end of the call. So, moving on to business. For the quarter, we generated $16.5 billion of net revenue, driven by 4.9% organic revenue growth and delivered core earnings per share of $1.59, a 9% increase on a core constant currency basis. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance in the quarter. The organic revenue growth represents another quarter of sequential acceleration and the highest rate of organic revenue growth in 12 quarters., Net Revenue, Organic Revenue\\nGrowth, Core Earnings Per Share, Operating Performance, Financial Performance, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The majority of our businesses again performed well with particularly strong performances by our international sectors and solid performance by Frito-Lay North America. And while North American beverages profit performance was impacted by inflation and a double-digit increase in advertising expense, the sector posted 2.5% organic revenue growth with a good balance between volume growth and net price utilization. Frito-Lay North America delivered balanced volume growth and net price realization, driven by strong innovation and brand marketing. For example, in June, we launched Stacy\\'s Cheese Petites, inspired by French cheese puffs. These bite-sized cheese snacks have real cheese baked inside, creating a sophisticated snacking experience. In fact, cheese is the primary ingredient. Petites are a good sources of calcium and have six grams of protein per serving. And they come in a resealable pouch, making them great for a convenient, on-the-go experience., International Sectors, North\\nAmerican Beverages, Organic Revenue Growth, Inflation, Advertising Expense, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Over the summer, Doritos and Mountain Dew partnered on our Worlds Collide program to appeal to our Gen Z consumers who thrive on exhilarating experiences. The program highlighted the brand\\'s recent innovations -- Doritos Blaze and Dew Ice -- and rewarded consumers who purchased both products with merchandise and experiences. The eight-week media campaign supporting the program spanned social media channels and was also featured on Pandora to reach our consumers listening to music. Tostitos growth was fueled by new products such as roasted red pepper and black bean and garlic. To support the product launches, we created a program to drive trial during the summer get togethers. Our Buy, Ride, Get Together Already program allowed consumers to scan a code on specially marked bags to redeem a $5.00 Lyft credit, making it even easier for our consumers to get safely to and from summer parties., Doritos, Mountain Dew, Gen Z\\nConsumers, Worlds Collide Program, Tostitos, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And Cheetos benefited from the launch of Cheetos Flaming Hot Chipotle Ranch earlier this year, appealing to consumers\\' growing desire for intense flavors. Cheetos further benefited from our Cheetos Museum Win What You See campaign. It was our first ever Cheetos promotion supported by TV commercials, directing consumers to winwhatyousee.com, where we invited our fans to find and submit unique Cheetos shapes to have a chance to win what they see. We garnered more than 80,000 submissions, and the program has now been localized and rolled across seven additional countries and counting. Turning to North American beverages, while the marketplace remains highly competitive, we are encouraged by improving overall category growth trends and a generally rational pricing environment. We had another quarter of sequential organic revenue performance improvement. Organic revenue growth of 2.5% is the best we\\'ve seen it in eight quarters., Cheetos, Flaming Hot Chipotle\\nRanch, Growing Desire for Intense Flavors, North American Beverages, Rational Pricing\\nEnvironment, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And it was driven by retail sales growth in Starbucks Ready-to-Drink coffee, Lipton Ready-to-Drink tea, Gatorade, our water portfolio, Pepsi, and Mountain Dew. Certainly, strong innovation across the portfolios contributing to the improving performance. For example, LIFEWTR continues its journey, advancing and showcasing sources of creativity with the launch of our Series 6 bottles themed diversity and design. LIFEWTR achieved more than $150 million in measured retail sales in 2017 which was its introductory year and is on pace to achieve more than $200 million in measured retail sales in 2018. Bubly, our new flavored sparkling water that has no artificial flavors, colors, or calories, which we launched in February of this year, continues to perform exceedingly well and is projected to exceed $100 million in measured retail sales in its first year., Innovation, LIFEWTR, Bubly, Measured Retail Sales, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mountain Dew\\'s performance is benefiting from the launch of Mountain Dew Ice, another launch which should surpass $100 million at retail in its first year from launch and from the return of Mountain Dew Baha Blast as our summer limited time offering. And in June, we launched Gatorade Zero with zero sugar and all the electrolytes of Gatorade Thirst Quencher. Gatorade Zero\\'s providing hydration options for more athletes in more locations and is off to a strong start. And we believe our stepped up advertising and marketing, particularly on trademarks, Pepsi and Mountain Dew are also starting to contribute to improved performance, as we saw sequential net revenue acceleration in both trademarks of the third quarter. Commodity inflation, operating cost inflation, particularly in transportation costs, product mix, and a stepped up advertising expense each pressured our profit performance in the quarter., Gatorade Zero, Advertising Expense, Commodity Inflation, Operating Cost Inflation, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, However, we expected our recently implemented pricing actions will improve profit performance in the coming quarter. At Quaker Foods North America, our hot cereal business posted its fifth consecutive quarter of market share gains, supported by our marketing campaign, highlighting the functional benefits of oatmeal and innovation like Simple & Wholesome Organic hot cereal, a multigrain hot cereal with no artificial colors or preservatives. In addition, Quaker light snacks gained market share with high-single-digit retail sales growth. And our Aunt Jemima pancake business grew retail sales for the eighth consecutive quarter. And to close out our conversation on North America, we are pleased to report that in third quarter, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to food and beverage growth at retail in the United States., Hot\\nCereal Business, Marketing Campaign, Retail Sales Growth, PepsiCo, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to our sectors outside of North America, we are extremely pleased with the 10% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and emerging market as a group which is a continuation of the strength we experienced across many of these markets in the first half. Strong marketplace execution led to continued solid growth across many of our key international markets. Within Latin America, organic revenue grew 10%, driven by high-single-digit growth in Mexico and double-digit growth in Argentina, Brazil, and Columbia. The LatAm team is doing an excellent job building our business and growing our market share in key countries in the region. In our Europe, Sub-Sahara, Africa sector, Russia and South Africa each grew organic revenue high-single-digits while Turkey and Poland had double-digit organic revenue growth. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the UK and France., Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Poland, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Again, continued good performance from this team. And in AMENA, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Saudi-Arabia, India, and Egypt and high-single-digit organic revenue growth in Australia. Excellent results from our AMENA team. This strong top-line performance translated into impressive bottom-line results with core constant currency operating profit up 12% in our international divisions as a group. The international results reflect our initiatives to continue to expand distribution of our big global brands and to innovate in locally relevant ways. For example, we continued to drive international growth of our zero sugar Pepsi Black and Pepsi Max trademarks with introductions of lime and cherry flavors across Eastern Europe, lime in the Nordics, and lime and vanilla flavors in the Philippines., International revenue growth,\\nPepsi Black and Pepsi Max, expansion of global brands, innovation, Eastern Europe, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re driving growth in Doritos internationally, whether through expansion to new markets like China where the brand just celebrated its first anniversary since launch, to innovation in existing markets, like India, where we launched Doritos Heat Wave. And the Quaker trademark continues its global expansion, from the launch of Quaker Super Foods in Mexico to our launches of Quaker Kids and Quaker Multigrain Instant Oatmeal platforms in China. Finally, during the quarter, we reached an agreement to acquire SodaStream. As we said on the day of the initial announcement, we believe PepsiCo and SodaStream are an inspired bunch. Daniel Birnbaum and the rest of the SodaStream team have built an extraordinary company that is offering consumers the ability to make great tasting beverages while reducing the amount of waste generated. That focus is well aligned with performance and purpose our philosophy of making more nutritious products while limiting our environmental footprint., International expansion, innovation, new product launches, acquisition, sustainability, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Together, we can advance our shared vision of a healthier, more sustainable planet. SodaStream will also add to our growing water portfolio while accelerating our ability to offer personalized in-home beverage solutions around the world. From breakthrough innovations like Drinkfinity to beverage dispensers like Spire for foodservice and Aquafina water stations for colleges and universities, we are finding new ways to reach consumers beyond the bottle. And the SodaStream acquisition is fully in line with that strategy. As we previously announced, the acquisition was unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. The transaction is subject to a SodaStream shareholder vote, certain regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. And consummation of the transaction is expected by January of 2019. We are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing across many of our international markets. In North America, Frito-Lay continues to perform well., International expansion,\\nsustainability, new product launches, acquisition, growth momentum, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Indra Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, North American beverages is making steady improvement. And our recently implemented pricing actions will help improve profit performance in North America. And finally, we are excited about the new opportunities that the pending SodaStream acquisition represents. With that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston., North American beverages, pricing\\nactions, SodaStream acquisition, profit performance, new opportunities, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Hugh Johnston, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Indra. And good morning, everyone. I\\'ll just provide a quick update on the outlook, and then we\\'ll move to your questions. After considering our year-to-date performance and other factors, we have updated our guidance for 2018. Specifically, we now expect at least 3% organic revenue growth for the full year. We now expect our core effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. We continue to expect core constant currency EPS growth of 9%. However, we now expect core earnings per share in US dollar terms of $5.65 which reflections a one-point headwind from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus rates due to the recent strengthening of the US dollar. This is an 8% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23. We continue to expect strong cash flow and to exercise disciplined capital allocation with prudent reinvestment into the business., Organic revenue growth, core\\neffective tax rate, core constant currency EPS growth, foreign exchange translation, cash flow and\\ncapital allocation, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Hugh Johnston, Chief Financial Officer, For 2018, we continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, including a $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter. And we now expect net capital spending of approximately $3.3 billion. We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018 with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a 15% increase in the annualized dividend per share that began with the June payment and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion. Finally, as you update your models, I\\'d like to highlight the following items to consider for the fourth quarter. Frito-Lay North America is lapping 5% organic revenue growth from the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect operating profit to decline in our AMENA division as we lap strong results and a refranchising gain in Jordan from the fourth quarter of 2017., Free cash flow, net capital\\nspending, dividends, share repurchases, organic revenue growth, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 3, Hugh Johnston, Chief Financial Officer, We expect the previously announced refranchising of our Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia business operations to benefit as a operating profit in the fourth quarter. And finally, based on market consensus forecast, we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both net revenue and operating profit by approximately three percentage points in the fourth quarter. With that, Operator, we\\'re ready to take the first question., Refranchising, foreign exchange translation,\\noperating profit, market consensus forecast, net revenue, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 2, Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Hi, it\\'s Jamie Caulfield. We appear to be experiencing some technical difficulties and having your questions fed also. So, I could ask you just to remain patient for a minute while we sort this out. Thank you., Technical difficulties, patience, questions, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Thank you, operator.

When discussing our financial results on today\\'s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures which exclude certain items such as the impact of foreign exchange translation from our reported results. You should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning\\'s earnings release and to the Investor section of PepsiCo\\'s website under the Events and Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.

We will start off with an overview of the first quarter and a discussion of each of the operating sectors\\' performance in a little more detail, and then Hugh will cover the full-year outlook., Thank you, Jamie, good morning, overview, operating\\nsectors, full-year outlook, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, For the quarter, we delivered $12.6 billion of net revenue and core earnings of $0.96 per share. Within the P&L, gross margin was impacted by input cost inflation, operating margin was further impacted by the front-line bonus we announced earlier this year. Foreign exchange translation had a positive impact of approximately 2 percentage points to both net revenue and reported EPS. Below the operating profit line, we benefited from a lower core effective tax rate., Net revenue, core earnings, gross margin, foreign\\nexchange translation, core effective tax rate, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The majority of our businesses performed very well in the quarter, excluding our North American Beverage division. In fact, excluding NAB, the company generated 4.6% organic revenue growth and 7% core operating profit growth when excluding the one-time front-line bonus. However, our North American Beverage sector continues to work through some challenges., Revenue growth, Organic revenue growth, Operating profit growth, North American\\nBeverage division, Challenges, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, So, let\\'s start with a discussion of NAB, separating long-term strategy from short-term executional issues. As you know, we\\'ve been transforming the business over many years to build a product portfolio that meets consumers\\' desire for a repertoire of great-tasting beverages, especially beverages with fewer or zero calories, in an assortment of packages that satisfy a broad range of occasions, from immediate personal refreshment, to family meal accompaniment, to social gatherings. Our focused and sustained transformation initiatives at NAB have been very successful on multiple dimensions. We have shifted our product mix to faster-growing subcategories and provided more low- and zero-sugar options, including recent innovations under the Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Propel, Lipton Tea House, and Starbucks trademarks. Since 2010, we have increased our volume mix of non-carbonated beverages by 7 percentage points., NAB, long-term strategy, short-term executional issues, product mix, low- and\\nzero-sugar options, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We have established and maintained strong leadership positions in many of the most attractive non-carbonated beverage categories, including ready-to-drink tea, ready-to-drink coffee, and sports hydration. The most recent quarter grew value share in a number of the fastest-growing categories, including tea, enhanced water, and sparkling water., Leadership positions, attractive non-carbonated beverage categories, value share\\ngrowth, fastest-growing categories, tea, enhanced water, sparkling water, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We have increased our CSD package variety so that our mix of non-traditional packages -- that is, everything other than two-liter and 20-ounce PET and 12-ounce cans -- has increased from 14% in 2011 to 21% today. We have reconfigured our supply chain to handle increased complexity and greater product assortment. For example, we have substantially increased flexible can line capacity, we expanded our co-pack network to give us greater packaging flexibility in an asset life model, and we are approaching having 60% of our route network converted to delivery via our geobox trailers, and we have equipped many of our trucks with chillers to expand our chilled DSD network., CSR package variety, supply chain reconfiguration, flexible can line capacity, co-\\npack network expansion, geobox trailers and chilled DSD network, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K.

We have ramped up our R&D and innovation efforts to launch products that are on trend with consumers. For example, this February, we introduced Bubly, a new flavored sparkling water with no artificial flavors, sweetness, or calories, and a branded packaging that conveys a playful and upbeat sense of humor. We recently launched Drinkfinity, now available online in the United States. This unique beverage system addresses growing consumer demand for customizable nutritious beverages in a more sustainable packaging., Equipment innovation, product customization, made nutritious options, R&D and\\ninnovation efforts, launched products, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We believe our strategy is sound and is positioning us well for the future. We are focused on the past three quarters, where our financial results have not lived up to our expectations from the North American Beverage business. So, what is the issue? Simply put, while most parts of the business are performing well, recent losses in cola market share in North America have led to subpar top-line and bottom-line performance over the past three quarters. We have studied in detail the causes for the share loss across every dimension. The overwhelming driver is that despite moderately increasing our media on trademarked Pepsi over the past three years, our share of voice has fallen dramatically relative to our key competitor, who has substantially stepped up their media spending on colas over the past two years., North American Beverage business, cola market share, share loss, media spend, key\\ncompetitor, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, To address this, we have allocated increased media to trademark Pepsi and we have heightened and elevated our brand communication, beginning with the launch of our new Pepsi Generations campaign. The campaign supports all the brands under the trademark Pepsi umbrella, and this will enable us to more effectively leverage the media investment across our full Pepsi portfolio. Importantly, we plan to substantially and sustainably support the campaign throughout the year while remaining disciplined on pricing., Allocated media, brand communication, Pepsi Generations campaign, pricing discipline, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re already seeing positive results from the campaign, with research telling us that the campaign is driving higher advertising recall, higher brand recall, and higher brand regard with consumers. And, our share performance has also begun to improve. These are important first steps. As we sustain the campaign, we anticipate it will translate to further improving sales and market share results., Positive results, research findings, higher advertising recall, higher brand\\nrecall, higher brand regard, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Encouragingly, beyond trademark Pepsi, North American Beverage is performing reasonably well in the context of a highly competitive environment. Our tea portfolio under Lipton and Pure Leaf has, over the past 17 quarters, grown retail sales in the range of mid-single digits to as high as 21%. Our enhanced water portfolio is performing well, with our premium LIFEWTR continuing to grow nicely as it enters its second year since its initial launch. Bubly\\'s early results following its 2018 launch are exceeding our expectations., North American Beverage performance, tea portfolio growth, enhanced water\\nportfolio, premium LIFEWTR growth, early Bubly results, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, KeVita, our line of premium organic live probiotic beverages, grew retail sales 50% in Q1 following 66% growth for the full year 2017. Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee grew retail sales 3% in the first quarter following 4% growth in 2017 despite a number of new competitive entrants in the category., KeVita growth, Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee growth, new competitive entrants, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Furthermore, we are pleased with both the improved trajectories and the outlook for both Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Both brands posted improved retail sales performance in the quarter versus the second half of last year, and our positive outlook for these trademarks are underpinned by robust 2018 innovations. In January, we launched Mountain Dew Ice, a clear, lemon-lime-flavored Dew made with a splash of real juice with just 100 calories per 12-ounce serving, and it is off to a strong start. Additionally, we expect our summer 2018 limited-time offering of Mountain Dew Baja Blast to perform well, especially relative to our Dew summer 2017 LTO, which fell short of our expectations., Mountain Dew, Gatorade, retail sales performance, innovations, Mountain Dew Ice, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Also, this summer, we will launch Gatorade Zero. Gatorade Zero will address the large and growing demand by athletes for additional hydration options. We are introducing a Gatorade that provides all the hydration and electrolyte solutions of base Gatorade without the carbohydrates. Gatorade Zero will give our athletes more flexibility in combining hydration with other fuel sources to meet their overall sports hydration nutritional needs. Taken together, we believe our plans will drive continued improved performance in the business. Finally, beyond the strategic and execution actions I just mentioned, we continue to consider all available options to drive greater shareholder value from NAB., Gatorade Zero, additional hydration options, carbohydrate-free Gatorade, sports hydration\\nnutritional needs, shareholder value, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, moving on to Frito Lay North America, we had solid performance with balanced volume growth and net price realization and continued strong market share results driven by great marketplace execution, innovation, and creative brand marketing. For example, building on the success of our 2017 launch of Lays Poppables, an entirely new growth platform for Frito, we extended the Poppables product line with the introduction of new Lays Poppables Honey Barbecue and a new 12-count multipack of Poppables Sea Salt. We continue to drive net revenue growth through increased trial and household penetration, which -- when combined with increased purchase frequency from the expanded product lineup and yearlong media support -- should continue to scale up this promising new brand extension., solid performance, balanced volume growth, net price realization, great marketplace execution,\\ninnovation, creative brand marketing, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K.

This year, we\\'re harnessing the power of sharing a smile and having a positive impact along the way. With Lays Smiles, we put more than 40 unique smiles on Lays bags, and with each purchase of a Lays Smile bag, we\\'ve donated a portion to Operation Smile.

Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Let me now turn to our sectors outside of North America. We are pleased with the 8% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and emerging markets as a group, which is an acceleration from the 6.5% growth we had in the fourth quarter of 2017. Stable to improving macro conditions combined with strong market execution have led to very strong growth across many of our key international markets. Within Latin America, organic revenue grew 10% in Mexico, high teens in Brazil, and 20% in Argentina., 8% organic revenue growth, developing and emerging markets, stable macro conditions, strong market\\nexecution, Latin America, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In AMENA, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, India, Egypt, and Pakistan. The growth in this sector continues to be diluted somewhat by beverage-tax-related declines in Saudi Arabia. In our Europe/Sub-Saharan Africa sector, Turkey and Poland organic revenue grew high teens while Russia and South Africa grew mid-single-digits. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw solid low single-digit growth in the U.K. and Spain, mid-single-digit growth in France, and high single-digit growth in Germany. Importantly, the strong top-line performance translated to impressive bottom-line results with core constant currency operating profit up 9% in ESSA, 10% in AMENA, and 17% in Latin America., double-digit organic revenue growth, beverage-tax-related declines, solid low single-digit growth,\\nimpressive bottom-line results, core constant currency operating profit, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The strong international results are, in part, a reflection of our initiatives to leverage our scale by increasingly coordinating commercial activities across markets and sectors. Example: With the increased global focus on zero-calorie beverages, we have continued to strengthen and scale our distinctive Pepsi Black under the Max or Zero Sugar brands, depending on the market, which drove double-digit organic volume growth globally and in the United States in 2017.

We have expanded Lays Oven-Baked to 14 markets with plans to nearly triple that number in the next two years, and the Lays Smiles campaign mentioned earlier has now been launched across markets in each of our sectors and grew retail sales mid-teens in the first quarter., Pepsi Generations campaign, \"This is the Pepsi\" ad, soccer-themed copy, Lays Oven-Baked expansion,\\nLays Smiles campaign, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Indra K.

Although North American Beverage is in the process of a turnaround, we have plans in place that we expect will lead to improving performance. With that, let me turn it over to Hugh., momentum in international markets, financial performance by Frito-Lay North\\nAmerica, turnaround plans for North American Beverage, solid performance, improving performance, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I\\'ll just provide a quick update on the outlook, and then we\\'ll move to your questions. From a macro perspective, we remain pretty positive. We see continued broad-based GDP growth with developed markets stable and developing and emerging markets accelerating. In most of our key markets -- including the U.S. -- the picture is relatively positive with strong employment, consumer spending, and consumer sentiment data. However, within this broadly positive picture, there remains a risk of geopolitical volatility in certain markets., macro perspective, GDP growth, developed markets, key markets, geopolitical volatility, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, From an industry standpoint, we continue to see pretty challenging conditions, including dynamic retail and consumer landscapes, a very competitive environment, some currency volatility -- most recently in the Mexican peso, Russian ruble, Turkish lira, and Brazilian real -- and commodity inflation. As Indra mentioned, within our businesses, the majority of our divisions are performing well, and we expect NAB\\'s results to improve as the year progresses., challenging industry conditions, dynamic retail landscape, competitive environment, currency\\nvolatility, commodity inflation, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, So, putting this all together, our guidance for 2018 remains unchanged. Specifically, we expect organic revenue growth at least in line with our 2017 growth rate of 2.3%. As we move through the year, our expectation is that we will continue to see some level of gross margin compression from inflationary input costs. Normally, you would see the gross margin contraction offset with SG&A productivity, but as we shared with you in February, with the benefit of a lower effective tax rate in 2018, we\\'re making investments to fortify the business as well as fund the front-line bonus, and these investments will largely offset the productivity-driven margin improvement. We expect our core effective tax rate to be in the low 20s, and we expect core earnings per share of $5.70, or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23., gross margin compression, organic revenue growth, effective tax rate, core earnings per share,\\ninvestments, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, We continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise disciplined capital allocation with prudent reinvestment in the business. For 2018, we continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, including a $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter and net capital spending of approximately $3.6 billion., cash flow, capital allocation, reinvestment, free cash flow, pension contribution, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Hugh F.

And, as we mentioned on the last conference call, we still see the prospect for even higher cash returns as we begin to fully realize the benefits of greater global cash mobility beyond 2018., cash dividends, share repurchases, global cash mobility, cash returns, benefits of\\ncash mobility, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2018, 1, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Finally, as you update your models, I\\'d like to highlight the following: We continue to expect our core constant currency EPS growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, as we will lap NAB\\'s softer performance and natural-disaster-related business disruptions in the second half. And, we expect variability in the timing of productivity savings, investments -- which includes the accrual of the front-line bonus -- and net commodity inflation to contribute to relatively better performance in the second half of 2018. With that, we\\'re ready to take the first question., core\\nconstant currency EPS growth, second half performance, NAB\\'s softer performance, natural disaster-\\nrelated business disruptions, productivity savings and investments, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Thank you, operator.

As you saw in this morning\\'s release, we concluded 2017 with another quarter of strong operating performance, capping off another successful year. In the fourth quarter, overall organic revenue growth accelerated sequentially from the third quarter to 2.3%, right in line with our expectations. Core constant currency operating profit increased 6% and core constant currency EPS increased 8%. We had particularly strong performance in the quarter in Frito-Lay North America with organic revenue growth of 5% led by impressive growth in variety packs, Ruffles, Tostitos, Doritos, and dips. We also gained market share both in salty snacks and the more broadly defined macro snacks categories. The business performed well throughout the year with strong brand activation and innovative new products propelling the top line and productivity programs continuing to move margins up., strong operating performance, organic revenue growth, core constant currency operating profit, core\\nconstant currency EPS, Frito-Lay North America, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Quaker Foods North America had very good performance. Hot cereals volume grew mid-single digits and we gained share in our three key categories of hot cereals, bars, and ready-to-eat cereals. North American beverages posted sequential improvement from the third quarter in organic revenue performance with volume trends improving in trademarks Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, and Lipton. More importantly, we have robust marketing innovation lined up for 2018, including the launch of our Pepsi Generations campaign, the launch of Mountain Dew Ice, which was prominently featured with Doritos Blaze at the Super Bowl, the introduction of Bubbly, our new sparkling water that combines refreshing flavors with an upbeat and playful sense of humor to shake things up in the sparkling water category, and further marketing support and packaging innovation as LIFEWTR enters its second year from launch., Quaker Foods North America, hot cereals, bars, ready-to-eat cereals, North American beverages, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Indra K.

Overall, its performance still has tremendous room to improve, and we\\'re taking the right steps to realize those opportunities.

We generated free cash flow excluding certain items of $7.3 billion, which exceeded our goal of approximately $7 billion we set out at the beginning of 2017.

The strength of new capabilities and e-commerce, research and development, social and digital marketing, and design have helped us connect with consumers in new ways.

The strength of our customer relationships in the United States was reflected in the most recent Kantar Retail PoweRanking Survey, where our retail partners once again named us as the No. 1 best in class manufacturer, and for the first time, we received a top ranking in every functional category, including Clear Company Strategy, Most Important Consumer Brands, Growth and Profitability, Sales Force and Customer Teams, Insights in Category Management, Supply Chain Management, and Use of Digital Platforms.

Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Further, our robust environmental sustainability agenda has complemented these initiatives. Its focus on reducing water and energy use and eliminating waste has brought reduced costs and vastly reduced our environmental impact. For example, in 2017, we accelerated our efforts to minimize PepsiCo\\'s environmental impact, enabling us to streamline costs and mitigate our operational impact on the communities we serve. We have teamed up with disruptor start-ups, leading universities, governments, and innovators to develop biodegradable film resins that meet the sustainable flexible packaging requirements of our global food and beverage business, a technology to help advance our goal of designing 100% of our packaging to be recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable by 2025., environmental sustainability agenda, water and energy use reduction, waste elimination, sustainable\\npackaging, biodegradable film resins, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Indra K.

As a result, our e-commerce business is approximately $1 billion in annualized retail sales and we are well-positioned to capitalize on what is sure to be a dynamic future in this space.

Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Looking to 2018, we are encouraged by a number of factors. The global economy is growing, with developed markets stable and a number of developing and emerging economies showing signs of acceleration. In most of our key markets, the picture is relatively positive with strong employment, consumer spending, and consumer sentiment data. In the United States, our largest market, we expect the recently enacted tax reform to have a positive impact on many sectors and businesses and on the economy overall., global economy, developed markets, developing economies, consumer spending, tax reform, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, However, our outlook is tempered by expectations for challenging industry conditions, including a continued dynamic retail landscape, shifting consumer preferences and behaviors, especially as it relates to the focus on health and wellness, a robust competitive environment, and rising commodity costs. Despite these challenges, we believe we are poised to continue to perform well precisely because we have been making the investments and taking the actions to adapt and thrive in the current dynamic environment., challenging industry conditions, retail landscape, consumer preferences, competitive environment,\\ncommodity costs, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, For 2018, we will be aided by the financial benefits provided by the recent U.S. tax reform, which will allow us to make incremental investments to further fortify our business. For example, in 2018, we will provide a bonus of up to $1,000.00 to full-time front-line U.S.-based associates to reward and recognize their dedication and contribution to making our business better and stronger, and we will invest in training our global associates to arm them with the skills to succeed in tomorrow\\'s workplace., tax\\nreform, bonus, training, dedication, contribution, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Indra K.

With that, let me turn it over to Hugh., responsible management, sustainable management, cash returns, owners, financial goals, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a discussion of our assessment of the impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform because it has implications for our 2018 financial outlook on a number of dimensions. From our perspective, it will affect five key areas. First, beginning in 2018, it will result in a lower tax rate on our U.S. earnings. Second, it imposes a one-time mandatory tax on our international accumulated earnings that existed as of year-end 2017, regardless of whether we choose to repatriate those earnings, but at a substantially lower rate that would have previously applied to actual repatriation. So, net, it provides a much more efficient framework in which to repatriate our international cash., U.S. tax reform, financial outlook, tax rate, international accumulated earnings, repatriation, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Hugh F. Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Third, it decreases our net deferred tax liabilities, as those tax-deferred items are now expected to be taxed at a lower rate at the point they became taxable. Fourth, it will allow for much greater mobility of our international cash forward. Fifth, it will drive higher cash-on-cash returns on U.S. capital projects as capital spending for the next five years will be immediately deductible for tax purposes., U.S.\\ntax reform, financial outlook, tax rate, international cash, capital projects, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Hugh F.

Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to our guidance for 2018, we expect organic revenue growth at least in line with our 2017 growth rate -- or 2.3% -- as we expect to continue to benefit from successful product innovation and strong marketplace execution but tempered by a cautious outlook as it relates to the retail environment and changing consumer behavior. As Indra mentioned, we expect to step up investment spending and front-line workforce training, digital capability, data analytics, e-commerce, and advertising and marketing. We expect our core effective tax rate to be in the low 20s and we expect core earnings per share of $5.70, or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23, with the benefit of the lower tax rate substantially offset by the incremental investments., organic revenue growth, successful product innovation, strong marketplace execution, cautious\\noutlook, investment spending, PepsiCo Inc.\\nPEP, 2017, 4, Hugh F.

So, for 2018, we expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, which includes the $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution. On this point, it is important to note the pension funding will reduce our gross debt from a rating agency perspective, so it creates room for leverage elsewhere within our capital structure. And, we expect net capital spending of approximately $3.6 billion.

Further, beyond 2018, we see the prospect for even higher cash returns as we begin to fully realize the benefits of greater global cash mobility.

Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company achieved record third quarter net sales. During the 2021 third quarter, the Company procured additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States, South America and Asia in response to increased consumer demand. However, the Company continued to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA during the 2021 third quarter.

In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holiday fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and you literally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons., Supply Chain, Sales, Selling Days, Product Launches, Price Increases, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2021, 3, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related and unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed., Sales, Short Period, Full Quarter, Product Launches, Economic Conditions, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2021, 3, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the Company\\'s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. The Company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory and we have and already in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs.

The company\\'s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The company\\'s bottlers and distributors are operating, and the company\\'s products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the company\\'s bottlers and distributors have, in part, been negatively affected for varying periods of time. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record second quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic., Supply Chain, Safety, Well-being, Operations, Net Sales, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2021, 2, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, The company\\'s supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company continues to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA, given the company\\'s volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. The company is also experiencing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally. As a result, the company was unable to fully satisfy demand in the 2021 second quarter in the United States and EMEA. We expect such challenges to continue for the next few months. The company has taken steps to source additional quantities of aluminum cans from the United States, South America and Asia. The company has entered into new supply agreements with two new aluminum can suppliers in the United States, and which are expected to be operational in the 2021 fourth quarter. We expect deliveries of additional quantities of cans increasing sequentially during the latter part of the year., Supply chain, shortages, aluminum can requirements, ingredient procurement, demand satisfaction,\\nsupply agreements, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2021, 2, Rodney C.

Our national summer on-pack promotion began in May with one of China\\'s top consumer ambassadors. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our planned launches and innovation of new products in a number of Asia-Pacific markets have been deferred for a few months. However, we still anticipate such launches taking place toward the end of the 2021 calendar year. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year., Pipeline Punch, Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Monster Dragon Gold, Asia-Pacific markets, new product\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2021, 2, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, We estimate that July 2021 sales to be approximately 1.8% higher than in July 2020. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2021 sales would have been comparable to the July 2020 sales. July 2021 had one less selling day than July 2020, which was 15.8% above July 2019, and which was 17.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Certain production facilities, mainly from the Coke bottlers in EMEA, in particular, delayed production from July to August 2021. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the company has not been able to fully satisfy demand in the United States and EMEA due to a shortage of aluminum cans, which adversely impacted July sales. Such shortage was exacerbated in July as can availability did not keep pace with increased demand during the summer months. Additional cans have been sourced from domestic and overseas suppliers with expected deliveries increasing sequentially during the latter half of the year. We are working to replenish system inventories in order to meet customer demand as soon as possible., July 2021 sales, foreign currency adjusted basis, selling days, production facilities, aluminum can\\nshortage, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2021, 2, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Additionally, the company also experienced delays in certain ingredients, which impacted supply. Our depletions remain solid as do our measured market data, as previously mentioned on this call. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays for, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons., ingredients, depletions, measured market data, selling days, new product launches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2021, 2, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company\\'s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses, and shipment facilities, and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry., Aluminum can shortage, new product innovation launches, COVID-19 pandemic, economic conditions,\\npositive points, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2021, 2, Rodney C.

Sacks, Co-Chief Executive Officer, In this regard, we are cautioned again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons., Selling days, days of the week, new product launches, price increases, promotions, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2021, 1, Rodney C. Sacks, Co-Chief Executive Officer, We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, currently, the company\\'s flavor manufacturing facilities, it\\'s co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating., Sales, short period, COVID-19 pandemic, new product innovation launches, positive points, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2021, 1, Rodney C.

Early in March 2020, the company implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants., Health, safety, well-being, travel restrictions, work-from-home policies, COVID-19 pandemic, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Throughout this period, the company has engaged with its employees through ongoing communications, online training and personnel development opportunities to promote their well-being and motivation. The company\\'s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating. Certain of the company\\'s bottlers and distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels, but the company\\'s products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of its bottlers and distributors have been more affected., Health, safety, well-being, COVID-19 pandemic, employee engagement, product availability, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record fourth quarter net sales. While our performance in EMEA was solid in the fourth quarter, EMEA remained adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in foodservice on-premise consumption., COVID-19 pandemic, record fourth quarter net sales, EMEA performance, consumer channel preferences,\\npackage configurations, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, The company\\'s sales in the 2020 second quarter, were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is the company\\'s largest channel, but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter, and throughout the 2020, third and fourth quarters. The company\\'s sales in e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business continued to increase in the fourth quarter, while its foodservice on-premise business, which is a small channel for the company, remained challenged., COVID-19 pandemic, sales, foot traffic, channels, e-commerce, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its product, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the company is not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages, and its supply chain remains intact. Company is continually addressing the increase in its aluminum can requirements, given the company\\'s volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry., COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain, raw material shortages, finished product shortages, aluminum can\\nrequirements, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, In the fourth quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.2 billion compared with $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter would have been up 18.3%. Net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to product returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and a labeling issue concerning one product in Japan. We will refer to this on our call as product returns., Net sales, foreign currency movements, product returns, European formulation issue, labeling issue, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was 57.7% compared with 60% in the 2019 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was primarily the result of the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 59.3% for the 2020 fourth quarter. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of increased input costs and unfavorable geographical mix during the 2020 fourth quarter, which were partially offset by favorable product mix., gross profit, net sales, product returns, inventory provisions, input costs, geographical mix, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were $288.4 million compared to $293.7 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were 24.1% compared to 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter, primarily Q2 decreased expenditures of $13.5 million for legal settlements and decreased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements, as well as travel and entertainment, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic., COVID-19 pandemic, operating expenses, legal settlements, sponsorships, travel and entertainment, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, The cost for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been or may be deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $11.4 million and increased expenditures of $8.2 million for social media and digital marketing., COVID-19 pandemic, sponsorship, endorsement, operating expenses, payroll expenses, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 4, Rodney C.

Sacks, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Net income increased 85% to $471.7 million, as compared to $255 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was positively impacted by a non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million, due to an intra entity transfer of intangible assets between certain of the company\\'s foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in a step-up of the tax deductible basis in the transferred assets in a foreign jurisdiction, and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and the book basis of such intangible assets., net income, non-recurring tax benefit, intra entity transfer, foreign subsidiaries, tax basis, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 4, Rodney C.

According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster\\'s market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of December 2020 decreased from 55.5% to 49.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily due to the impact of the product returns in Japan as well as initial trial sales following the launch of new products by two large competitors.

Our sales in the 2020 second quarter, were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel, but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter and throughout the 2020 third quarter., COVID-19 pandemic, consumer preferences, package configurations, sales performance, foot traffic, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 3, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser, and grocery related business continued to increase in the quarter, while our Foodservice on Premise business, which is a small channel for the company remained challenged.

Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is unable to estimate, in which future periods if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $14.5 million, increased expenditures of $7.4 million for social media and digital marketing, and increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $6 million., COVID-19 pandemic, deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs, operating expenses, payroll\\nexpenses, social media and digital marketing, outbound freight and warehouse costs, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 3, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Operating income was $458.6 million, up from $395.4 million in the third quarter of 2019.

Thank you for attending this call. I\\'m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary announcement., Good Afternoon, Ladies And Gentlemen, Hilton Schlosberg, Tom Kelly, Cautionary\\nAnnouncement, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 2, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Let me begin by stating that our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health, safety and well-being of our employees. As mentioned on our previous call, in early March 2020, we implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. Our offices have partially reopened in the United States and in certain countries, and our field sales teams are operating in the field with our bottlers, distributors and retailers, subject to safety protocols., Health, Safety, Well-being, Travel Restrictions, Work-From-Home Policies, Guidance From\\nPublic Health Authorities, Professional Consultants, Office Reopening, Field Sales Teams, Bottlers,\\nDistributors, Retailers, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 2, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers, and bottlers and distributors around the world who are ensuring the integrity of our supply chain. Our flavor manufacturing facilities, our co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating. Certain of our bottlers and distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels. But generally, our products remain available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of our bottlers and distributors have been more affected. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on our net and gross sales for the 2020 second quarter in part due to certain of our bottlers and distributors reducing their inventory levels. However, we did see a sequential improvement in sales in the latter half of the quarter as certain countries and states began to gradually reopen., Teamwork, Supply Chain, Flavor Manufacturing Facilities, Co-Packers, Warehouses, Shipment\\nFacilities, Modifications, Core Points And Service Levels, Availability Of Products, Adverse Impact\\nOn Net And Gross Sales, Sequential Improvement In Sales, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 2, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in immediate consumption. Our sales in the second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel, but improved sequentially throughout the quarter. Our e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business continued to increase in the quarter while our foodservice on-premise business, which is a small channel for us, remains challenged. Currently, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture and our bottlers and distributors to distribute our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic., Consumer Channel Preferences, Package Configurations, At-Home Consumption, Immediate\\nConsumption, Foot Traffic, Convenience And Gas Channel, E-Commerce, Club Store, Mass Merchandiser,\\nGrocery And Related Business, Foodservice On-Premise Business, Co-Packers, Bottlers And\\nDistributors, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 2, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, In addition, we are not experiencing raw material or finished product shortages in our supply chain. Monster Energy Cares, our philanthropic arm, continues to be actively engaged in a number of philanthropic efforts, including donating products to individuals working on the front lines, such as first responders, healthcare workers, hospitals and the National Guard. Based on currently available information, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity. In the second quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.09 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 second quarter would have been up approximately 1%.

Operating income was $407.3 million, up from $379 million in the second quarter of 2019, due in part to lower sponsorship and endorsement costs of $19.8 million as well as lower travel and entertainment expenses of $10.1 million. The cost for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been, or may be, deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. Net income increased 6.5% to $311.4 million as compared to $292.5 million in the 2019 comparable quarter.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $328.3 million, 30% of total net sales in the 2020 second quarter compared to $343.3 million or 31.1% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. The decrease was largely due to the reduction of sales in EMEA during the quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $18.2 million in the 2020 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company\\'s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.

The COVID-19 pandemic\\'s adverse impact on net sales was more pronounced in EMEA for the three months ended June 30, 2020, particularly in the Strategic Brands segment. Net sales in EMEA were also adversely impacted by the reduction in inventories by certain of our bottlers and distributors. In addition, to a lesser extent, the trading dispute between Coca-Cola bottlers and the European buying group, primarily in Western Europe, resulted in the temporary delisting of some Coca-Cola and Monster products, which had an adverse impact on net sales in EMEA for the three months ended June 30, 2020., EMEA, COVID-19, Strategic Brands, Net Sales, Trading Dispute, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 2, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We are pleased that in the second quarter, Monster gained market share in Denmark, Great Britain, Greece, Norway, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.

As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjugate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today\\'s call. In the United States, our bottlers focused on relaunching our first quarter product innovation, which plans were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Canada, we did not launch any new items within the second quarter of 2020 and continue to grow our distribution of all first quarter 2020 innovations. In Honduras, we launched Fury, Gold Strike in the affordable energy category during April 2020, and in Salvador in early July 2020., Litigation, VPX, Trade Dress Infringement, Product Innovation, Distribution, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 2, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Initial results have been positive.

And Monster Hydro Sport was launched in Spain in May 2020, and we plan to launch Monster Hydro Sport in an additional market in 2020. We\\'re also pleased with the performance of Reign and we plan to launch Reign in an additional six markets in 2020., New product launches, Expansion into new markets, Lockdowns, Product availability, Plans for future\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 2, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We launched Monster Mule in Poland in July 2020 and plan to launch Monster Mule in an additional nine markets in 2020.

Currently innovation launches for all EMEA markets for the third and fourth quarters remain on track despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, these launches will continue to be subject to developments in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in individual countries., New product launches, Expansion into new markets, Lockdowns, Product availability, Plans for future\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 2, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, In Japan, we continued with the strong rollout of Pipeline Punch to 90% of the country. And in June launched Ultra Paradise with solid consumer acceptance. With strong innovation and continued growth of our core, we have further built on our number one country share position in value. In South Korea, Monster Energy retained its number one share position in value and in June began shipments for the summer 2020 launch of Ultra Paradise. In April 2020, we began distribution of our new Monster Energy Dragon Tea in China, which is noncarbonated. Early feedback from consumers has been positive.

India remains mostly in national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which took effect on March 25, 2020.

As of August 4, 2020 approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate July 2020 gross sales to be approximately 15.8% higher than in July 2019. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, July 2020 gross sales would have been approximately 17.1% higher than comparable July 2019 gross sales.

We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related and favorable economic conditions continue to intensify, the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches, could be prolonged and may become more severe., Share repurchase, Gross sales, Foreign currency adjustment, Sales volume, Available repurchase\\nprogram, COVID-19 pandemic, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 2, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points: one, the company\\'s priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees; two, currently, the company\\'s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating; three, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio; four, we are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno thermogenic fuel high-performance energy drinks.We are planning for future launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.; five, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally.

Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I\\'m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is on the call, as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement., New product launches, Expansion into new markets, Lockdowns, Product availability, Plans for future\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 1, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Let me begin by stating that our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has affected the health of so many individuals around the globe, including some of our team members. This includes myself. In mid-March, I began to experience flu-like symptoms, tested positive for COVID-19 and thankfully made a good recovery. I\\'m feeling good but for an occasional cough. For this, I\\'m very grateful. And we are fortunate that everyone at our company who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 is doing well and has been making good progress., New product launches, Expansion into new markets, Lockdowns, Product availability, Plans for future\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 1, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The company has always operated with co-leaders, and I would like to thank Hilton and the leadership team for their leadership and support during this difficult period. To everyone at Monster, my sincere thanks and appreciation for all your efforts. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Early in March 2020, we implemented global travel restrictions and work from home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants., New product launches, Expansion into new markets, Lockdowns, Product availability, Plans for future\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 1, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers and bottlers, distributors around the world, who are ensuring the integrity of our supply chain. Our flavor manufacturing facilities, our co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating. Certain of our bottlers, distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels. But generally, our products remain available to consumers. In limited countries, which are smaller markets for us, the operations of our bottlers and distributors have been more affected. Since March 2020, while various markets have faced governmental measures, restrictions and guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sales and merchandising activities of certain of our bottlers and distributors have been modified., New product launches, Expansion into new markets, Lockdowns, Product availability, Plans for future\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 1, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our net and gross sales for the 2020 first quarter was not material. The company\\'s April sales were materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, bottle and distributor sales of the company\\'s product to retail in the United States were markedly less adversely impacted. Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at home consumption and a decrease in immediate consumption., New product launches, Expansion into new markets, Lockdowns, Product availability, Plans for future\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 1, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, To date, our sales in the second quarter have been adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel and food service on-premise. While our e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business remain stable. Currently, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture and our bottlers and distributors to distribute our products as a result of COVID-19 pandemic., New product launches, Expansion into new markets, Lockdowns, Product availability, Plans for future\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 1, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In addition, we are not experiencing raw material or finished product shortages in our supply chain. Monster Energy Cares, our philanthropic arm, is actively engaged in a number of philanthropic efforts, including donating products to individuals working on the front lines, such as first responders, healthcare workers, hospitals and the national guard. Based on currently available information, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity., New product launches, Expansion into new markets, Lockdowns, Product availability, Plans for future\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 1, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the first quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.06 billion, up 12.3% from $946 million in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 first quarter would have been up 13.4%. Operating income was $365 million, up from $311.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in net income was 6.6%. The lower percentage increase in net income was primarily due to our higher effective tax rate in the quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019, primarily attributable to a decrease in the equity compensation deduction., New product launches, Expansion into new markets, Lockdowns, Product availability, Plans for future\\nlaunches, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2020, 1, Rodney C.

In April, we began distribution of our new Monster Energy Dragon Tea, which is noncarbonated and which has received early positive feedback.

Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2019 compared to December 2018 Monster\\'s retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 16.9% to 33.5% in Brazil from 19.6% to 27.4% and in Chile from 34.9% to 39.8%.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.7% compared to 42.1% in the same quarter in 2018.

Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In January 2020 Monster Energy was launched by the Coca-Cola Bottler in Israel. We continued the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Mango Loco in December. We also continued Ultra White\\'s expansion from September\\'s launch to further provide a broad portfolio with strong taste experiences for Indian consumers. The Monster range continued to build significant active distribution increases across China in the 2019 fourth quarter versus a year ago but the situation in China is currently challenging. I wanted to provide an update regarding the recent coronavirus or COVID-19 outbreak. First of all our number one priority is the safety of our employees in China. We are thinking of everyone who has been affected by coronavirus and we continue to monitor the situation closely. In addition to having employees in China we and our suppliers currently globally source certain ingredients from third-party manufacturers in Wuhan and other parts of China. We also manufacture finished goods through third-party bottlers and co-packers in China., Monster, Israel, India, China, COVID-19, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The coronavirus outbreak could adversely affect our business and cause disruptions internationally due to the closure or suspension of activities at such third-party manufacturers as well as within China at our co-packing facilities and our China office. Ingredient sourcing delays could also interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products internationally. In addition the outbreak together within the accompanying special government measures could adversely affect the growth of our business in China and affect demand for our products. However it\\'s too early to determine what impact it will have on our global supply chain and our operations. As I\\'ve said before our first priority is employee safety and we are continuing to monitor the situation closely. I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. VPX the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising. VPX filed a trademark lawsuit in March 2019 against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and another lawsuit suit in August 2019 against Monster alleging a host of legal challenges including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX., coronavirus, COVID-19, business, supply chain, operations, litigation, Vital\\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., Bang energy drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, These proceedings are ongoing. In October 2019 the U.S. District Court denied VPX\\'s motion for a preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In its decision the court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and failed to establish it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims. In October 2019 VPX announced its intention to launch its own line of Reign-branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. Later that month we filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and prevent VPX from infringing Monster\\'s trademark rights in this way. In November 2019 VPX stipulated that I would refrain from launching such products until the district judge entered a final order on the preliminary injunction motion. In January 2020 the magistrate judge issued a reported recommendation that an injunction be granted in Monster\\'s favor. Motions for summary judgment have been filed by Monster in this proceeding and which are currently pending., Reign Total Body Fuel, trademark lawsuit, preliminary injunction, motion for a preliminary\\ninjunction, stipulation, magistrate judge, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 4, Rodney C.

In October we launched Java Monster Farmer\\'s Oats which contains oatmeal and is our first plant-based coffee product being nondairy and vegan as well as two new flavors in the Reign brand family Strawberry Sublime and Mang-O-Matic to supplement our Orange Dreamsicle line extension which was launched at the end of the third quarter.

We are planning to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific over the upcoming months including a full country relaunch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in March 2020 and Ultra Paradise in South Korea and Japan later this year. We estimate January 2020 gross sales to be approximately 15.3% higher than in January 2019.

Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, January 2020 had the same number of selling days than in January 2019. In this regard we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days days of the week in which holidays fall timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion I\\'d like to summarize some recent positive points., January 2020 sales, selling days, holidays, new product launches, price increases and promotions,\\nproduction schedules, distribution partners, short-term sales, full quarter sales, future period\\nsales, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 4, Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Retail sale statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. New additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company\\'s sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year as well as our innovation pipeline in 2020. We\\'re encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno thermogenic fuel high-performance energy drinks not only within the U.S. but also internationally. We are pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets.

We\\'re going to turn now to the quarter and we\\'ll move on from there. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve at an increasing pace. And we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the third quarter of 2019 net sales were $1.13 billion up 11.6% from $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements net sales for the quarter would have been up 12.8%. The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States portion of our products effective November 1 2018., consumer beverage preferences, tastes, innovation, net sales, foreign currency movements, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 3, Hilton Schlosberg, Chief Financial Officer, Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements net sales for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 14.6%. Turning now to gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the 2019 third quarter was 59.4% compared with 59.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset by price increases as well as reduced input costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 4.1% in the 2018 third quarter. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.2% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% for the 2019 third quarter as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales was 6.5% compared to 6.2% in the same period in 2018., gross profit, percentage of sales, geographical and product sales mix, price increases,\\ninput costs, distribution costs, selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative costs,\\npayroll expenses, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 3, Hilton Schlosberg, Chief Financial Officer, Payroll costs increased $10.4 million primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and noncash item was $16 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $14.1 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate increased from 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter to 25% in the 2019 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions as well as a decrease in the equity compensation deduction. In addition the comparative effective tax rate for the 2018 third quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit. Net income was $298.9 million in the 2019 third quarter compared to net income of $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter an increase of 11.6%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 third quarter increased 14% to $0.55 from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2018. Now we turn to The Coca-Cola Company transition update. In the third quarter of 2019 Monster Energy was launched by or transition to Coke bottlers in the Dominican Republic El Salvador and Honduras. We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator our affordable energy brand in the third quarter of 2019 in Botswana and in Slovakia. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019. In China we completed the rollout of both Monster Ultra White and Monster Mango in the third quarter., payroll costs, stock-based compensation, noncash items, effective tax rate, equity\\ncompensation deduction, net income, diluted earnings per share, The Coca-Cola Company transition\\nupdate, Monster Energy, Predator, international launches, Eastern Europe, Africa, China, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 3, Hilton Schlosberg, Chief Financial Officer, We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continue the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Ultra White into approximately 20% of our accounts in September. We will continue Ultra\\'s expansion into the fourth quarter as well as commencing the launch of Mango Loco to leverage consumer taste preferences in India. I\\'ll now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals VPX the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing. In August 2019 VPX filed another lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida alleging a host of legal challenges including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. Monster will seek the dismissal of VPX\\'s most recent lawsuit., Monster Energy, Ultra White, Mango Loco, litigation, Vital Pharmaceuticals, Bang Energy\\nDrinks, Reign Total Body Fuel, Southern District of Florida, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 3, Hilton Schlosberg, Chief Financial Officer, In October 2019 the U.S. court -- the U.S. District Court for the Southern District denied VPX\\'s motion for a preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In its decision the court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and fail to established that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims. VPX recently announced an intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. We recently filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster\\'s trademark rights in this way. In one of the court filings in May 2019 we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million., U.S. District Court, Southern District, preliminary injunction, trademark lawsuit, Reign\\nTotal Body Fuel, energy drinks, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 3, Hilton Schlosberg, Chief Financial Officer, Our sales of Reign through October was solid as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers were lower than our initial expectations. As with any new product launches sales may be affected by many factors including retail authorizations the dates on which listings are secured for products at major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. As our litigation with VPX is sub judice we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today\\'s call. Now we\\'re going to turn to the Nielsen reports in North America. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 26 2019 for all outlets combined namely convenience grocery drug mass merchandisers sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 9.1% versus the same period a year ago.

Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. And now we turn to EMEA.

In this regard we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days days of the week in which holidays fall timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and you need to actually determine their production schedules which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons., Gross sales, Sales, Foreign currency movements, Selling days, Production schedules, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 3, Hilton Schlosberg, Chief Financial Officer, We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even 2 months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.

I\\'ve also previously addressed the lawsuit filed against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPXs trademark lawsuit against Monster filed in March, 2019, but proceedings are ongoing. In one of the court filings in May, 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019, we\\'re projected to exceed $235 million. Ourselves of Reign for June and July was solid as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers were lower than our initial expectations as any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including authorizations, the date or dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The Company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products. As our litigation with VPX is subjugate.

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $888.3 million at June 30, 2019, compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018.

Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.5 days at June 30, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $299.5 million at June 30, 2019, from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 60.9 days at June 30, 2019, compared to 67 days at December 31, 2018. We estimate July 2019 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in July 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, July 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 17.4% higher than comparable July 2018 gross sales. There was one more selling day in July 2019 than in July 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons., Cash, Investments, Accounts receivable, Inventories, Gross sales, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 2, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.

As of August 7, 2019 approximately $520.6 million remained available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase programs.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products., Gross sales, Expenditures, Non-GAAP measure, Consumer beverage preferences, Innovation, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 1, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, In the first quarter of 2019, net sales were $946 million, up 11.2% from $850.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net sales in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 60.6% compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2018. For the quarter ended March 21, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in North America and, to a lesser extent, product sales mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical sales mix and increases in certain input costs., Net sales, Foreign currency movements, Gross profit, Product sales mix, Geographical sales mix,\\nInput costs, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 1, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.8% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 3.9% in the 2018 first quarter.

Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $13.4 million in the same quarter in 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter to 16.8% in the 2019 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the deductions for equity compensation as well as the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the United States., Payroll costs, Stock-based compensation, Effective tax rate, Deductions for equity compensation,\\nProfits earned by foreign subsidiaries, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 1, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, Net income was $261.5 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to net income of $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of 21%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 first quarter increased 26.7% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2018. We continue to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. In March 2019, we agreed to the assignment of the Kalil Bottling Group\\'s distribution territories to Coca-Cola Bottlers in the southwestern United States. We incurred no distributed termination costs and received no deferred revenue in connection with this assignment. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from Big Geyser\\'s territory, which is located in New York metro markets, to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has been fully transitioned to old Coca-Cola network bottlers. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia., Strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers, Distribution territories assignment, Distributed\\ntermination costs, Deferred revenue, Launch of Monster Energy in new markets, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 1, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA. We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand, in Namibia and Mozambique in the first quarter of 2019. We\\'re also planning launches of Predator in certain markets in Eastern Europe in the second quarter of 2019 as well as in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019., International launches, EMEA, Predator, Namibia, Mozambique, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 1, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, We launched Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We also launched Monster in Paraguay last week and anticipate launching in the Dominican Republic in the second quarter. In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we also began the launch of Monster Mango, which we\\'ll continue throughout the second quarter of 2019. We\\'ve significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these 3 SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continued the rollout of Monster across India, and Monster is now available in approximately 90% of the country. We are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019, Monster, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, China, India, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 1, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, I will now provide a quick update on our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we\\'ve stated, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions, including an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has developed 3 energy drink product that it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. By mutual agreement, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018 for a determination of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market, sell or distribute these products. The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing., Arbitration, The Coca-Cola Company, Energy drink category, Agreements, Exceptions, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 1, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, On the schedule, the bodies agreed 2 months ago. Monster expects a decision from the arbitrators before the end of the second quarter. Although Coca-Cola has announced it is proceeding to launch its new energy drinks in certain countries without waiting for the arbitration panel to rule on the issue, Coca-Cola\\'s entitlement to continue to sell such drinks will be governed by the outcome of the arbitration. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate to work together as partners., Arbitration, Monster, Coca-Cola, Energy drinks, Partnership, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 1, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, I also wanted to take a moment to address a matter that has received some attention, Monster\\'s litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising, including false and unsupported claims, that Bang contains ingredients that it does not have and provides benefit that it does not generate. VPX has continually attempted to delay our lawsuit. In April, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which is scheduled for hearing in June 2019. In March 2019, VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster. I have 2 comments to make. Firstly, the lawsuit is meritless., Litigation, False advertising, Preliminary injunction, Trademark lawsuit, Bang energy drinks, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 1, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, Months after Monster publicly announced the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in mid January 2019, a company related to VPX allegedly purchased an unrelated Reign trademark for a different class of products, namely powdered dietary supplements. Monster holds trademark and use priority over VPX for its Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in the clause that covers these beverages. We recently filed a reply to VPX\\'s complaint which sets forth our opposition in detail and asserts counterclaims against VPX for trademark infringement and unfair competition. Secondly, this lawsuit will not impede or slow the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel., International launches, EMEA, Predator, Namibia, Mozambique, Monster, Paraguay, Dominican\\nRepublic, China, India, Arbitration, The Coca-Cola Company, Energy drink category, Agreements,\\nExceptions, Partnership, Litigation, False advertising, Preliminary injunction, Trademark lawsuit,\\nBang energy drinks, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2019, 1, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, As our litigation with VPX and the arbitration with Coca-Cola are subjudicate, we will not be answering questions on these matters on the call.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com, in the financial information section. Consumer preference beverage -- consumer beverage preferences and types are continuing to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. Net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by 8.5 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606., Gross sales, Non-GAAP measure, Consumer beverage preferences, New products, Accounting Standards\\nCodification 606, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 4, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company\\'s customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses. Net and gross sales for the three months ended December 31, 2018, were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the third quarter of 2018 due to a preannounced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 2018, which affected our fourth quarter. The company estimates such impact to net and gross sales was approximately 16 and 18 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales were 924.2 million, up 14.1% from 810.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017., ASC 606, Commissions, Net sales, Gross sales, Price increase, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 4, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 15.1%.

The company recorded fourth-quarter gross sales of 1.06 billion, up 13.7% from 934.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately16.2 million of foreign currency movements., ASC 606, Foreign currency movements, Gross sales, Net sales, Percentage increase, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 4, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter was 59.7%, compared to 62.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.1% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in input -- certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; geographical sales mix as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales, our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins; domestic product sales mix; and the 8.5 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increases in domestic sales prices as well as the decrease in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales., Gross profit, Net sales, Aluminum cans, Freight, Input costs, Geographical sales mix, Domestic\\nproduct sales mix, Commissions, Promotional allowances, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 4, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 3.6% in the 2017 fourth quarter.

Stock-based compensation and noncash item was 14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $13 million in the same quarter in 2017. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $3.1 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 23.1% in the 2018 fourth quarter., Payroll costs, Stock-based compensation, Noncash item, Losses in China, Effective tax rate, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 4, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act, signed into law on December 22, 2017, as well as a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. In addition, the comparative 2017 fourth-quarter effective tax rate included a onetime provisional charge related to the revaluation of the company\\'s deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, and the onetime charge for the deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act., Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Tax Reform Act, Deferred tax assets, Effective tax rate, Foreign income, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 4, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The decrease in the provision for income taxes was also partially offset by a decrease in the stock-based compensation tax deduction. Net income was 239.1 million in the 2018 fourth quarter, compared to net income of 201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, an increase of 18.8%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 to 556.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.

I wanted to take a moment to address an issue previously covered on our last call, and that\\'s our investor presentation in New York in January concerning our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company., Monster, Mango Loco, India, China, Arbitration, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 4, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As we reported, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions. Coca-Cola has developed three energy products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to The Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply to those energy products. As a result, we have a disagreement with Coca-Cola over the interpretation of that exception., T1: Agreements, T2: Energy drink category, T3: Exceptions, T4: Disagreement, T5: Interpretation, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 4, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, By mutual agreement, to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018, and that process is under way with the parties participating cooperatively. Coca-Cola had indicated that it had suspended the proposed launch of its proposed energy product until April 2019. We cannot predict with certainty when the result of the arbitration will be published but reasonably expect a resolution of the issue in the second quarter of 2019. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners.According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through January 26, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 11.3% versus the same period a year ago., T1: Arbitration, T2: Parties, T3: Launch, T4: Resolution, T5: Nielsen reports, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 4, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sales of Monster grew 11.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 5.6%, and sales of Full Throttle increased 2.8%.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market., Sales, Market Share, Decrease, Increase, Nielsen Statistics, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 4, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.

In this regard, we note, and as explained on our fourth-quarter 2017 call, that the increase in gross sales of 27.9% in January 2018 as compared to January 2017 FOREX adjusted to 25.1% was in part due to the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 by certain of our international distributors; b, initial shipments of Caffe Monster and Muscle Monster, which we launched in January 2018; and c, more of innovation in 2017 had a more substantial impact on January 2018 sales than innovation in 2018 has had on our January 2019 sales.

We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.

Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the Company\\'s customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates are now included as a reduction to net sales, whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses., Beverage Category, Positive Momentum, Net Sales, Accounting Standards Codification 606, Commissions\\nPaid, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, Growth in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 were impacted by advanced purchases made by our customers due to a pre-announced price increase, effective November 1, 2018 on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The Company estimates such impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million respectively., Growth, Net Sales, Price Increase, Pre-Announced, Estimated Impact, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7% from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements. The Company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7% from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements., Gross Sales, Foreign Currency Movements, Net Sales, Adoption of ASC 606, Percentage Increase, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8%, compared to 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage as adjusted for ASC 606 would have been 60.3% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans freight in and other input costs; the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; domestic product sales mix; and geographical gross profit mix., Gross Profit, Percentage of Net Sales, Aluminum Cans, Freight, Input Costs, Commissions,\\nPromotional Allowances, Domestic Product Sales Mix, Geographical Gross Profit Mix, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million, largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the US. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2%, compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter as compared with $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter. Excluding distributor termination expenses in both quarters, the comparable general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018, compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.2%, compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million, primarily due to headcount growth both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the Company\\'s products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter as compared to $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter., Distribution Costs, Selling Expenses, General and Administrative Costs, Payroll Expenses, Legal\\nExpenses, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to US taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter., Losses in China, Effective Tax Rate, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Domestic Production Deduction,\\nAnticipated Effective Tax Rate, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to $560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributor termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share., Net Income, Weighted Average Shares Outstanding, Diluted Earnings Per Share, Excluding Distributor\\nTermination Expenses, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We\\'re also making good progress in the US in non-traditional channels, including foodservice accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the third quarter of 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola bottlers. This concludes the Anheuser-Busch distributed transition in the United States. In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in Azerbaijan and in Armenia. Last week, we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand and plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets., Strategic Alignment, Non-Traditional Channels, Transition of Arkansas, Launches in EMEA, Launch of\\nPredator in South Africa, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019. In China, we continue to focus our efforts toward establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on distribution in the Top 40 cities and to key accounts targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics.

Mutant Energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam., Mutant Energy, Affordable Energy Brands, Launched in Myanmar and Vietnam, Available in Cambodia,\\nMyanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, I wanted to take a moment to address one aspect of our agreements with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the Company, Coca-Cola and certain affiliates restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the energy drink category, with certain exceptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed two energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. While (ph) mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018. Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019., Coca-Cola Agreements, Energy Drink Category, Exceptions, Arbitration, Suspension of Launch, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico., Nielsen statistics, Mexico market, OXXO convenience chain, sales promotions, brand influence, Monster Beverage\\nMNST, 2018, 3, Rodney Cyril Sacks, Chairman & CEO, I\\'d like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to address these supply chain and production issues. In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased marginally in dollars and increased 0.6% in local currencies over the same period last year.

Gross sales for the month ended October 2018 were impacted by advanced purchases by our customers due to the price increase effective November 1, 2018 on certain Monster Energy drinks.

In the second quarter, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 12% from $907.1 million in the second quarter of 2017.

Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 second quarter, as compared to 3% in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of $10.7 million, largely due to higher carrier cost contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.4%, compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago.

Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter to 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017.

With our continued momentum this quarter, we are raising our full-year guidance for organic growth of 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 14%.

In addition, we continue to project approximately $200 million from higher wages and other manufacturing costs. Continued progress and gross margin recovery puts us in a great position to advance our commercial programs., Currency impact, Input costs, Wages and other manufacturing costs, Gross margin recovery,\\nCommercial programs, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2023, 2, Nelson Urdaneta, Chief Financial Officer, We expect advertising spend to increase by approximately 100 basis points for the full year.

Thank you, Christina, and welcome to K-C. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Back when we introduced our strategy in 2019, we could not have imagined the unprecedented challenges we are about to face., Strategy, Challenges, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Over the past four years, K-Cers did what we do best, provide great care, care that our consumers, our customers, our employees, and our communities needed all around the world. At the peak of the pandemic, people counted on our brands to support the health and hygiene of their families, and I\\'m proud of what our teams were able to achieve to fulfill our purpose of better care for a better world. Now, as we look back at our results, there are three themes I\\'d like to emphasize. Theme number one, our strategy to accelerate growth is working., Strategy, Growth, Care, Families, Purpose, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Since 2019, we\\'ve grown our business by about 1.5 billion in sales and delivered 4% average organic sales growth. In that time, we\\'ve accelerated our organic growth by improving our product offering and market positions, with meaningful innovation and world-class commercial execution. In 2022, organic sales increased by 7% and over delivering on our goals at the beginning of the year. This was achieved in what turned out to be a uniquely challenging global environment., Strategy, Growth, Sales, Organic growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 2022 also marked Kimberly Clark\\'s 150th anniversary, a year in which we celebrated generations of category-defining innovation. We\\'re proud to have created many of our categories, including feminine care and facial tissue, under the leadership of our Kotex and Kleenex brands. We are inventors at heart. New products created during the last three years contributed to over 60% of our organic growth in 2022., Innovation, Anniversary, Categories, Leadership, Growth, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Whether it\\'s Kotex DreamWear for ultimate overnight protection, or Kleenex Allergy Comfort, our product obsession, advantage technology, and consumer-centric focus is enabling us to create meaningful value and accelerate category growth. This is, perhaps, most evident in China, where we continue to post double-digit organic growth in the face of a declining growth rate and challenging COVID operating conditions. With major upgrades in dryness and thinness, our products are among the best in the market, led by Huggies Super Deluxe, the softest diaper in China. Our strong portfolio, supported by superior technology, will continue to anchor Kimberly Clark\\'s leadership in the world\\'s largest baby and child care market., Innovation, Product obsession, Advantage technology, Consumer-centric focus, Category growth, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Theme number two, we\\'re making strong progress on margin recovery. Over the past two years, we faced unprecedented inflation worth over $3 billion, a roughly 1,500 basis-point headwind to gross margin. Our teams have done an excellent job mitigating this impact. Our product leadership, commercial agility, and cost discipline enabled us to rapidly implement broad pricing actions and generate over $700 million in cost savings., Margin recovery, Inflation, Gross margin, Product leadership, Commercial agility, Cost discipline, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The successful implementation of revenue growth management actions drove an inflection in our profitability in the second half of the year. Gross margin stabilized in Q3 and increased year over year in Q4 by over 200 basis points. This was our first major improvement in the last eight quarters. Collectively, these actions enabled us to fully offset inflation and currency headwinds in 2022 on a dollar basis., Revenue growth management, Profitability, Gross margin, Inflation, Currency headwinds, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Recently, market prices of some inputs have begun to ease, although they remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. While we\\'re encouraged by this, it will take time for these benefits to work through our contracts and flow through the P&L. Nevertheless, we\\'ll continue to leverage our scale to improve efficiency and reduce costs. At the same time, we expect our revenue management efforts will continue to positively impact this year., Easing of market prices, Benefits working through contracts, Improving efficiency, Reducing costs,\\nRevenue management efforts, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This will aid ongoing gross margin recovery while also enabling us to continue investing in our business. At the midpoint of our 2023 guidance range, we plan to improve operating margin by approximately 80 basis points. With incremental headwinds below the line, this translates to 2% to 6% growth in earnings per share in 2023. We also intend to increase our dividend for the 51st consecutive year., Gross margin recovery, Operating margin, Earnings per share, Dividend, Incremental headwinds, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Theme number three, we will continue to invest to drive balanced and sustainable growth. We\\'re scaling innovation that delivers better value, more benefits, and better care for our consumers. We continue to see strong demand for great performing products. New Poise Ultra Thins and expanded sizing for the pant drove share gains in adult care, both from a dollar and unit standpoint, this past year in North America., Innovation, Demand, Share gains, Scaling, Value, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll be launching several exciting initiatives in 2023, including our GoodNites youth pant, which can hold the equivalent of three bottles of water, exclamation point, as well as exciting performance upgrades for Huggies diapers. At the same time, we\\'ll leverage the broad range of our offering to address the growing need for value through compelling commercial programs. Now, to wrap up my prepared remarks, I\\'m very proud of K-Cers around the world. They continue to execute with excellence, standing tall in the face of countless challenges, all to fulfill our purpose of better care for a better world., Initiatives, GoodNites youth pant, Performance upgrades, Commercial programs, Execution, Purpose, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve assembled an excellent management team that has tremendous experience unlocking global growth.

Our third quarter results also reflect ongoing volatility in the operating environment, which continue to pressure operating margin and earnings.

Our growth strategy is working and our teams are executing with excellence in what continues to be a volatile operating environment. Clearly, our results reflect this ongoing volatility. For the year, we\\'re now anticipating 300 million of additional input cost inflation., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Nelson Urdaneta, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 2, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We remain committed to recovering and eventually expanding our margins, and thus we\\'ve taken further action to realize additional pricing and cost savings to mitigate these headwinds. We continue to expect pricing cost savings to fully offset the effects of inflation over time. Based on the strength of our top line, we\\'re raising our full year organic sales outlook to increase 5% to 7%. We\\'re maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Nelson Urdaneta, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2022, 2, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, However, based on current conditions, including our updated input cost outlook, we now expect to be in the lower end of that EPS range. We\\'ll continue to manage our business with discipline as we navigate near-term headwinds based on the pace and breadth of our pricing actions, we anticipate some volume impact over the balance of the year. Still, we\\'re encouraged by the overall health of our categories and our brands.

These actions, which began in the first half, helped us deliver organic sales growth and improve net selling prices in the second half of the year, including strong fourth quarter performance.

While we\\'re encouraged with our top line performance and the way our teams executed in a very dynamic environment, our margins and earnings were negatively impacted by a challenging operating environment. Input costs escalated well beyond previous levels, and supply chain disruptions limited our ability to fully meet the growing consumer demand for our products., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 4, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In 2022, we intend to accelerate organic growth further.

We remain confident in the potential of our brands and categories and in our ability to create meaningful shareholder value while we work to achieve our purpose of Better Care for a Better World., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 3, Taryn Miller, Vice President, Finance and Interim Head of Investor Relations, Thank you, and good morning everyone.

During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to adjusted results and outlook both excludes certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Okay, thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I\\'d like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we\\'re taking in response to this dynamic and challenging macro environment. Organic sales were strong of 4% in the quarter and included the impact of pricing actions implemented in the second and third quarters. In North America Personal Care organic sales were, up 11%, driven by mid single-digit increases in both net selling price and volume., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In D&E markets personal care, organic sales were up 7% organic sales increased double digits in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Eastern Europe and South Africa. Our top line performance was strong despite the resurgence of COVID, which impacted growth in ASEAN, Latin American and KC Professional. Our market positions remain strong and are improving reflecting strong innovation and excellent commercial execution in nearly all key markets. Our share positions in North America remain solid with good sequential gains in personal care, our share performance in D&E markets remains robust, where we continue to strengthen our diaper leadership positions in key markets including China and Brazil., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We also continue to focus on cost with our teams delivering solid savings of $150 million in the quarter. In addition, we reduced between the line spending. Now, clearly our margins and earnings were disappointing, as higher inflation and supply chain disruptions increased our costs well beyond the expectation we established just last quarter., Earnings, Cost Savings, Disruptions, Margins, Earnings, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'d like to highlight the effect of three areas of volatility that are most impacting our business. First, as we noted in July and on the basis of external forecast we had expected, commodity prices to ease in the second half of 2021 instead prices for resin and pulp increased further in the third quarter and are now expected to stabilize at a meaningfully higher level than our prior estimate., Earnings, Commodity Prices, Volatility, Business Impact, External Forecast, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Second, a tight US labor market and disruption in domestic and international transportation markets are having an elevated impact on our supply chain as we work to get our products to the shelf and meet consumer demand., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Third, energy cost were up dramatically in Europe, where natural gas prices have risen as high as 6 times year-ago levels. Energy prices in North America are also up sharply, although not to the same extent., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, As a result, our margins are down -- but we\\'re down with declines only partially mitigated by the actions we\\'ve taken to-date. We\\'re not pleased with our results and we\\'re taking further action to mitigate the impact of higher input and labor costs. These steps include further pricing actions, additional initiatives to ensure we achieve our cost savings goals, and tightening discretionary spending. At the same time, we remain committed to investing in our brands and commercial capabilities. While we expect to see some benefit from these actions in 2021, we have further reduced our outlook for the year. This reflects our third quarter performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And while we\\'re not ready to call our outlook for 2022, I will offer perspective on key variables that will affect our plan next year. First, we continue to build top line momentum. In addition, our pricing actions, brand investment and commercial program should provide further benefit in 2022. Second, some discrete headwinds we faced this year will be behind us. This includes the US winter storm and presumably consumer tissue destocking. Third, some headwinds we faced this year may become more persistent, we\\'re now expecting further inflation on several key commodities, we\\'re also expecting continued tightness in the labor and transportation markets, which will continue to impact our global supply chain all the way to our customers., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In addition, the going forward impact of COVID on both demand and supply remains very unpredictable. We will continue to move decisively and navigate changing market conditions. We will also continue to invest in our brands and capabilities to maintain brand momentum. Our strategy is working and we remain confident in our future and are confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Taryn Miller, Vice President of Finance and Interim Head of Investor Relations, Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s second quarter earnings conference call., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Taryn Miller, Vice President of Finance and Interim Head of Investor Relations, On the call with me today are, Mike Hsu, our Chairman and CEO; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release and we also published prepared management remarks from Mike and Maria that summarized our second quarter results and full-year 2021 outlook. Both documents are available on the Investors section of our website. We hope you find it valuable to have prepared remarks ahead of this call., Earnings, Conference Call, Kimberly Clark, Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Taryn Miller, Vice President of Finance and Interim Head of Investor Relations, In just a moment, Mike will share a few opening comments and then we\\'ll take your questions. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to adjusted results and outlook both excludes certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures., Financial Outlook, Forward-Looking Statements, Risk Factors, Adjusted Results, Annual Report, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Okay, thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the Q&A, I\\'d like to offer some additional perspective on our performance., Financial Outlook, Performance Perspective, Q&A, Additional Insights, Good Morning, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Clearly our results did not turn out as we expected and we knew it was a tough comp given our strong growth and record profitability in the year ago quarter. Now while we expected volatility this year, the external environment has proven to be even more volatile than our expectation at the beginning of the year and versus our April update. Since we spoke in April, commodity inflation has spiked higher and our supply chain has been challenged. These dynamics are impacting us and more broadly the industry., Financial Outlook, External Environment, Commodity Inflation, Supply Chain, Industry Dynamics, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also navigating historic levels of demand volatility in Consumer Tissue. Last year, we worked really hard to support our consumers and our customers as demand increased at a record pace. While we expect the category to retract this year that decline has meaningfully outpaced our expectation. This has been driven by reduced at-home consumption due to increased mobility and destocking of both consumer pantries and retailer inventory., Financial Outlook, Consumer Tissue, Demand Volatility, At-Home Consumption, Retail Inventory, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Consumer Tissue has historically been very stable and we expect demand to normalize over time. We remain confident in our brand fundamentals, even as we acknowledge that the short-term tissue outlook has been difficult to call. We\\'ve taken decisive action to offset the impact of raw material inflation. We have announced pricing in key markets around the world. Our pricing actions are on track and we expect to fully offset the effects of input cost inflation over time, as we\\'ve done in previous cycles., Financial Outlook, Brand Fundamentals, Raw Material Inflation, Pricing Actions, Demand\\nNormalization, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve also taken prudent steps to control and reduce discretionary spend across the business. We expect this to be reflected in our results as we continue to implement these actions. We view this level of input cost inflation and the COVID driven demand volatility to be discrete issue. We will continue to take appropriate action to reduce the impact of volatility over time. At the same time, we remain confident and committed to our approach to building brands. Despite near-term challenges, we have plenty of bright spots in our business. Our strategy to invest in our brands is working., Financial Outlook, Discretionary Spend, Input Cost Inflation, COVID Demand Volatility, Brand\\nBuilding Strategy, Bright Spots, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, You can see this in our second quarter results broadly across Personal Care and especially in D&E markets. Excluding North American Consumer Tissue, our organic sales were up 4%. Personal Care organic sales were up 6% globally, driven by a 4% volume increase. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were up 8% with very strong market share performance, including in China, Brazil throughout Eastern Europe, India, Peru and South Africa. We have recently captured number one diaper share positions in China and Brazil, which reflects the strength of our brand fundamentals with consumers., Personal Care, D&E Markets, Organic Sales, Brand Fundamentals, Market Share Performance, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Importantly, we\\'re starting to see green shoots in KC Professional. The business grew year-over-year and sequentially as we saw strength in international markets and positive trends in washroom products. As more companies transition back to in-person environments, we expect KCP momentum to improve in the back half. We\\'re encouraged by our underlying brand performance and have made significant progress in addressing the supply challenges we faced earlier this year in our North American Personal Care business., KC Professional, International Markets, Washroom Products, In-Person Environments, Brand\\nPerformance, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Looking forward to the second half, we are expecting better results across the business. We believe the major factors impacting this quarter do not reflect the fundamental health of our business. We remain committed to our strategy to deliver balanced and sustainable growth for the long term. We\\'ll continue to execute KC Strategy 2022 and we\\'ll invest in our business for the future. This includes investments in innovation, commercial capabilities and technology. Importantly, I also want to emphasize that we are acutely aware of the impact of this pandemic continues to have on our employees, our consumers and our partners and the world., Business Results, Fundamental Health, Strategy Execution, Innovation, Commercial Capabilities,\\nTechnology, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our people and all that interact with Kimberly Clark. Now with that we\\'d like to address your questions., Health and Safety, Prioritization, People Interacting with Kimberly Clark, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 1, Paul J. Alexander, Vice President of Investor Relations, Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I\\'m joined today with Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release and we also published prepared management remarks from Mike and Maria that summarized our first quarter results and full year outlook.

Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Okay. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I\\'d like to start the call today with a few brief remarks. Our first quarter results and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, faster than expected consumer tissue destocking and a sharp rise in input costs. While I\\'m not pleased with the results and our outlook, we\\'re taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face. We\\'ll continue to invest in our brands and commercial capability to ensure we\\'re able to grow both in the near-term and in the long-term. We gain market share in 2020 and our shares are off to a good start this year with strong gains in many key markets., Business Results, Supply Chain Disruption, Consumer Tissue Destocking, Input Costs, Brand\\nInvestment, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, At the same time, we\\'re moving rapidly especially with selling price increases to offset commodity headwinds. We\\'ve done this successfully in past commodity cycles and we expect to do this again now. I remain confident in the underlying health of our brands and in our growth strategies. We\\'re operating in a very dynamic environment. We know how to manage through this. I\\'m confident our team will execute with excellence and will continue to build a stronger company for long-term success and value creation., Commodity Headwinds, Selling Price Increases, Brand Health, Growth Strategies, Dynamic Environment, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2021, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, with that, we\\'d be happy to take your questions., Taking Questions, Earnings Conference Call, First Quarter Results, Full Year Outlook, Investors\\nSection, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Paul J. Alexander, Vice President of Investor Relations, Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s year-end earnings conference call., Earnings Conference Call, Year-End Results, Full Year Outlook, Investors Section, Taking Questions, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Paul J. Alexander, Vice President of Investor Relations, This morning, you will hear from Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. We sincerely hope everyone is continuing to stay healthy and safe. And in keeping with our social distancing procedures, this morning, Mike, Maria and I are each in different locations in our Dallas office., Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Social Distancing, Stay Healthy, Safe, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Paul J. Alexander, Vice President of Investor Relations, As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we\\'ll be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures., Business Results, Forward-Looking Statements, Risk Factors, Adjusted Results, Reconciliations, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call this morning., Mike Hsu, Maria Henry, Social Distancing, Stay Healthy, Safe, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Let me start with the headlines for the full year results. We delivered strong top and bottom line growth and exceeded our previous outlook. We significantly increased our brand and capability investments and improved our market shares. We generated excellent cost savings and cash flow, and we returned significant cash to shareholders., Strong Growth, Brand Investments, Market Shares, Cost Savings, Cash Flow, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s cover the details of our results, starting with sales. Full year net sales were $19.1 billion. That\\'s up 4% year-on-year and included a 2 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales grew 6%, with healthy underlying performance and increased demand related to COVID-19. Volumes were up 4%, and net selling prices and product mix each increased 1%. Mike is going to provide some more color on our top line and market share performance in just a few minutes., Sales, Net Sales, Currency Rates, Organic Sales, Volumes, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Moving on to profitability. Full year adjusted gross margin was 37.1%, up 210 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 10%. We generated $575 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs. That was well above our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October. For 2021, we\\'re targeting $400 million to $460 million in total cost savings., Profitability, Adjusted Gross Margin, Cost Savings, FORCE Programs, Restructuring Programs, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Commodities were favorable by $175 million in 2020 although they turned inflationary in the fourth quarter. We\\'re planning for commodity inflation of $450 million to $600 million in 2021. Costs are projected to increase broadly in most areas, including pulp and recycled fiber, resins, superabsorbent and distribution expenses. Other manufacturing costs were higher in 2020, including costs related to COVID-19. Foreign currencies were also a headwind, reducing operating profit at a high-single digit rate., Commodities, Inflation, Costs, Manufacturing Costs, Foreign Currencies, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Moving further down the P&L, between the line spending was up 110 basis points as a percent of sales. That was driven by advertising, which was up 90 basis points. SG&A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation, along with capability building investments. Adjusted operating margin was 18.7%, up 90 basis points, and adjusted operating profit grew 9%. In terms of Company profitability for 2021, the midpoint of our planning assumptions implies a 70 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin. And while there are a number of moving pieces, it\\'s likely that adjusted gross margin will be down somewhat more than that., Moving Down P&L, Advertising, SG&A Spending, Capability Building Investments, Company\\nProfitability, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Turning back to 2020 results. Full year adjusted earnings per share were $7.74, up 12%. Our October guidance was for earnings of $7.50 to $7.65. In addition to the strong growth in adjusted operating profit, the bottom line benefited from higher equity income, a lower share count and a slight decline in adjusted effective tax rate., Strong Growth, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Operating Profit, Equity Income, Adjusted\\nEffective Tax Rate, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s turn to cash flow [Technical Issues] Cash provided by operations was an all-time record $3.7 billion, up $1 billion year-on-year, reflecting outstanding working capital performance and strong earnings. Cash flow is expected to be down year-on-year in 2021, driven by higher cash taxes and working capital. Nonetheless, cash flow should remain strong and well above 2019\\'s level. Capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, in line with plan and the prior year. We plan to spend between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2021, including activity for our restructuring program and a pickup in growth projects. Based on an initial outlook at longer-term opportunities, we believe spending will be elevated again in 2022., Cash Flow, Cash Provided by Operations, Capital Spending, Working Capital, Restructuring Program, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.15 billion. That\\'s the 10th consecutive year we\\'ve returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. We expect to return a similar level of cash to shareholders in 2021, and as mentioned in the earnings release, our Board has already approved our 49th consecutive annual dividend increase and authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program., Capital Allocation, Dividends, Share Repurchases, Cash Returned to Shareholders, Board Approval, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program. We continue to make significant progress as we head into the last year of this program. We\\'re about 85% to 90% through the total pre-tax charges, which we\\'ve increased somewhat to reflect delays as a result of COVID-19 and costs for additional savings opportunities. So far, we\\'ve generated $420 million of savings and expect to achieve between $540 million and $560 million of savings by the end of 2021. Our original savings estimate was $500 million to $550 million., Restructuring Program, Pre-Tax Charges, Savings, COVID-19, Costs for Additional Savings\\nOpportunities, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Finally, at this point cash payments are about 75% to 80% complete., Cash Payments, Completion, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Overall, it was an excellent year financially, while we invested more in the business for the long term and navigated the COVID-19 environment., Excellent Year Financially, Investment for Long Term, COVID-19 Environment, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hey, let me begin by saying that I\\'m very proud of our KC team and our accomplishments in 2020. We worked tirelessly to protect the health and safety of each other by setting and maintaining strict safety protocols, all of which are in place today. We kept our global supply chain running and safely served the needs of our consumers and customers, and in many cases, delivering record output. At the same time, we delivered healthy top line growth across our portfolio, gained market share, invested to strengthen long-term brand fundamentals and delivered strong financial results., Safety Protocols, Global Supply Chain, Consumers and Customers, Top Line Growth, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Looking more closely at our business segments, we saw excellent performance in Personal Care, with 5% organic sales growth and strong share performance. In North America, organic sales rose 6%, driven by broad-based growth in baby and child care. Our market shares were up nicely on both Huggies diapers and GoodNites youth pants. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were also up 6% despite volatile market conditions. More specifically, Personal Care organic sales were up double digits in China, India and South Africa; up high single digits in Eastern Europe; and up low-single digits in Latin America. We also improved our share positions in many D&E markets., Personal Care, Organic Sales Growth, Share Performance, North America, Market Shares, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Looking at our other segments. Organic sales were up 13% in Consumer Tissue and down 7% in K-C Professional. As expected, both businesses experienced the effect of COVID-19 and the shift to more consumers working from home. We\\'re pleased with how our K-C team managed through that volatility. To meet elevated demand in Consumer Tissue, we significantly reduced our SKU count and leveraged our global supply network to increase production, including support from KCP. We continue to focus on category expanding and brand building programs while improving our market execution. Those actions helped us gain market share for Kleenex facial tissue in North America and Europe., Consumer Tissue, Organic Sales Growth, K-C Professional, COVID-19, Market Execution, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In KCP, where the washroom category continues to be a significant part of our business, we made good progress pivoting to growth opportunities in other parts of the business, including in wipers and safety products. Sales of those products were up double digits in North America. Importantly, we grew or maintained market share in approximately 60% of the 80 key cohorts that we track. I\\'m pleased to see our brands winning in the marketplace., KCP, Washroom Category, Growth Opportunities, Safety Products, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Overall, our results were strong, and I\\'m encouraged by the way we executed in 2020., Strong Results, Execution, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Next, I\\'ll turn to our outlook for 2021. We expect a more challenging environment, especially compared to last year. More specifically, we expect some of the net benefit from COVID dynamics, including higher consumer demand, to reverse. In addition, commodity costs are rising globally, and we\\'re also reflecting our latest view on economic conditions and birth rate trends. Despite these factors, we\\'re confident in our ability to deliver top line growth and expect to strengthen our market positions and improve our Company for long-term value creation. Our plans call for total sales growth of 4% to 6% in 2021, and that includes 2 points from the Softex acquisition and a 1 to 2 point benefit from currencies., Outlook for 2021, Challenging Environment, Net Benefit from COVID Dynamics, Commodity Costs,\\nEconomic Conditions, Birth Rate Trends, Total Sales Growth, Softex Acquisition, Currencies, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We expect to grow organic sales 1% to 2%. We plan to leverage and scale our brand-building capabilities and investments that we\\'ve made over the past two years. We have a healthy innovation pipeline, including near-term launches for Huggies in North America, China, Eastern Europe and Latin America, and we\\'ve also upgraded products for our global Kotex brand in several markets. We expect to benefit from selective pricing actions and other revenue management programs, but we\\'re not currently planning for broad-based list price increases. And we\\'ll continue to make capability and technology investments to drive long-term success., Organic Sales Growth, Brand Building Capabilities, Innovation Pipeline, Selective Pricing Actions,\\nRevenue Management Programs, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, On advertising, spending should be similar to 2020 levels, and this reflects the increases we made over the last two years and confidence in the strong ROIs from digital. We believe this level of investment is sufficient to support our growth plans in the current environment., Advertising Spending, ROIs from Digital, Growth Plans, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, On the bottom line, we\\'re targeting adjusted earnings per share of $7.75 to $8. That\\'s even to up 3% year-on-year. We\\'re focused on delivering our annual plan, while managing the quarter-to-quarter volatility that could be higher than normal in this environment., Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Target, Year-On-Year Growth, Quarter-To-Quarter Volatility, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, because of the different COVID dynamics in 2020 and 2021, we think it is relevant to consider our performance over both years. So on that basis, using the midpoint of our 2021 outlook, we\\'re projecting to grow organic sales approximately 4% and to increase adjusted earnings per share 7% on average over that two-year period. Those growth rates are slightly above our medium-term objectives., Organic Sales Growth, Adjusted Earnings Per Share Growth, Two-Year Period, COVID Dynamics, Medium-\\nTerm Objectives, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In conclusion, we\\'re on track with KC Strategy 2022, and we\\'re managing effectively through a very challenging environment. We\\'re improving our top line and strengthening our brands, our market positions and our Company for the long term. We continue to be optimistic about our opportunities to deliver balanced and sustainable growth and create shareholder value., Growth, Brands, Market Positions, Company, Shareholder Value, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, That concludes our prepared remarks. And so now we\\'ll be happy to take your questions., Growth, Brands, Market Positions, Company, Shareholder Value, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Paul J. Alexander, Vice President Investor Relations, Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This morning, you will hear from Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. We have a presentation of today\\'s materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements this morning., Growth, Brands, Market Positions, Company, Shareholder Value, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Paul J. Alexander, Vice President Investor Relations, Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest quarterly and annual reports for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook both exclude certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures., Growth, Brands, Market Positions, Company, Shareholder Value, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 3% with good underlying momentum and benefits from increased demand related to COVID-19. We significantly increased our growth investments and improved our market positions. We had another strong quarter of achieving cost savings and returning cash to shareholders. And finally, while earnings were down as expected, we are increasing our full-year outlook., Growth, Brands, Market Positions, Company, Shareholder Value, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s look at the details of our results, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.7 billion. That\\'s up 1% from year ago and includes a two-point drag from currency rates. Volumes were up 2% and the combined impact of changes in net selling prices and product mix increased sales by 1%. By segment, organic sales rose 10% in Consumer Tissue and 5% in Personal Care, but declined 15% in K-C Professional., Growth, Sales, Volumes, Currency Rates, Segments, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Mike will talk more about our top-line and our market share performance in just a few minutes. Moving on to profitability. Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.2%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 2%. We had excellent cost savings performance in the quarter. Combined savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs totaled $140 million, including continued strong productivity improvements., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Commodities were a benefit of $25 million in the quarter driven by pulp and other raw materials. Other manufacturing costs were higher year-on-year that included incremental costs related to COVID-19. Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit by a high single digit rate in the quarter., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Moving further down the P&L. Between the lines spending was 18.9% of sales. That\\'s up 180 basis points and driven by a big step up in digital advertising. G&A also increased including capability-building investments and higher incentive compensation expenses. We expect between the lines spending will rise further sequentially in the fourth quarter., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Our SG&A spending is typically high in the fourth quarter and this year we\\'ll also have project activities that were temporarily delayed because of COVID-19. All in all, for the fourth quarter-for the third quarter, sorry, adjusted operating profit was down 6% and operating margin was 17.2%, down 130 basis points versus year ago., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, By segment, operating margins were up in Consumer Tissue and Healthy and Personal Care. K-C Professional margins were down significantly, including an approximate 600 basis-point drag from fixed costs under absorption. On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 in the quarter, compared to $1.84 in the year-ago period., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $559 million compared to $886 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was as expected and driven by the timing of tax payments and higher working capital. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Third quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $560 million. And for the full year, we expect the total will be $2.15 billion., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, So let me now turn to the full year. The overall headline is that we\\'re raising our top and bottom-line outlook. On the top-line, we now expect organic sales growth of 5% compared to our prior target of 4% to 5%. Through nine months, organic sales are up nearly 6% and we expect a solid fourth quarter. On average, we expect slightly less headwinds from currency rates than previously anticipated., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, In addition, we\\'ll begin consolidating the Softex Indonesia business into our results on November 1 on a one-month lag. All in all, we expect net sales will grow 2% to 3% this year. That\\'s one point better than our previous estimate. On the bottom-line, our new outlook is for adjusted earnings per share of $7.50 to $7.65. That represents year-on-year growth of 9% to 11%., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Our prior outlook was for adjusted EPS of $7.40 to $7.60. The increase in our outlook is driven by improved top line, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense and other manufacturing costs. Overall, I\\'m encouraged that we\\'re improving our near-term outlook and investing significantly in the business for longer-term growth., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. I\\'ll begin by reinforcing that we remain focused on three near-term priorities that we established since the outbreak of COVID-19. First, we\\'re focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and our consumers. Second, we\\'re proactively managing our supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products. And third, we\\'re prudently managing the business through near-term volatility, while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly Clark., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our 40,000 employees continue to do heroic work in this COVID environment. Our supply chain operations have remained online with strong productivity gains and fewer COVID-related disruptions over the last three months. The environment is still dynamic and we\\'re closely monitoring virus hotspots. And thus far, our supply chain has been resilient and our teams have done a great job overcoming daily challenges., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now turn to our results focusing on organic sales category conditions and our market shares. As Maria mentioned, organic sales increased 3% in the quarter. In North American consumer products, organics sales rose 8%. Now within that Personal Care grew 6% driven by broad-based volume growth in baby and child care. We improved our market shares on diapers, baby wipes, and in child care. In late July, we launched Pull-Ups New Leaf training pants which features super-soft natural materials and is our most premium training pants., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This is another example of our elevate the core strategy and action. And New Leaf is off to a very good start. In North American consumer tissue, organic sales increased to 11% and that reflects strong demand due to the COVID-19 work from home environment and strong momentum on Kleenex facial tissue. Bathroom tissue shipments benefited from our efforts to restore customer inventory levels., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In the fourth quarter, we expect more benefit from those efforts and from people continuing to spend more time at home. Our market share performance in North American consumer products was strong in the third quarter; shares were upper even in six of eight categories. Turning to K-C Professional North America, organic sales declined 15%. Sales were down about 35% in washroom products. And as you\\'d expect, the category has been significantly impacted. There are fewer people working in offices and lower levels of business activity, including in travel and lodging., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sales were a bit better in September, but we\\'re planning for only a modest near-term improvement in the environment. On the other hand, KCP sales were up double digits in wipers, safety and other products. Our efforts to expand our face mask business by leveraging our superior non-wovens technology is off to a good start. We\\'re also expanding our wipers line-up with Scott 24-Hour, which delivers long-lasting surface protection from bacteria., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Moving to D&E markets, organic sales were up 2% that was driven by 7% growth in Personal Care. In terms of key personal care markets, organic sales were up mid-teens in China, mid-single digits in both Latin America and Eastern Europe and strong double-digits in India. Organic sales were down mid-single digits in ASEAN. We also improved our market shares in many countries in the quarter. And that includes Brazil, China, throughout Eastern Europe, India, and Peru., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, While category conditions remain difficult in many D&E countries, government restrictions on social mobility and store operations have eased somewhat since the last quarter. Finally, in developed markets, organic sales were up 3% driven by strong growth in consumer tissue. Looking ahead, we\\'re launching Kleenex Proactive Care in the UK and other markets in EMEA. This lineup includes hand towels, anti-bacterial hand and face wipes, sanitizing gel, and face masks., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now in terms of market share performance, we continue to make good progress. We\\'re on track to grow or maintain share in approximately 60% of the 80 category/country combinations that we track. This is a result of higher investment levels, innovations, and strong in-market executions. Our capabilities are driving our results and our investments are working hard for us. Through nine months, I\\'m very encouraged with our performance, how we\\'re navigating this environment and how our teams are taking care of each other and our customers., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Before closing, I\\'d like to comment on our recent acquisition of Softex. This transaction is a strong strategic fit with our focus on accelerating growth in personal care in D&E markets. Softex expands our presence in a high-growth market where we had limited exposure. The diaper market in Indonesia is already the sixth largest in the world, and that\\'s projected to nearly triple in size over the next decade. Our Softex team has built a strong business with deep local market knowledge, excellent brands and market positions and strong profitability., Growth, Strategic Fit, Market Expansion, Local Market Knowledge, Profitability, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, This transaction improves our underlying growth prospects, and we\\'re looking forward to leveraging our combined strengths in innovation, marketing, and go-to-market. In conclusion, we\\'re managing through the COVID environment safely and effectively. We remain optimistic about our opportunities to generate long-term growth and create shareholder value. We\\'re investing in our brands and improving our market positions. We are raising our full-year outlook and are on track to achieve excellent financial results. And we continue to operate our business with a balanced and sustainable approach as we execute K-C strategy 2022., Growth, Strategy, Investment, Optimism, Financial Results, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 3, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now that concludes our prepared remarks and now Maria, Paul, and I will be happy to take your questions., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Paul Alexander, Vice President and Investor Relations, Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This morning, you will hear from Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. We have a presentation of today\\'s materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Paul Alexander, Vice President and Investor Relations, Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest quarterly and annual report for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook both exclude certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures., Growth, Sales, Profitability, Cost Savings, Market Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I hope everyone is continuing to stay healthy and safe in this environment. Let me go ahead and start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 4%, reflecting good underlying momentum and net benefits from increased demand related to COVID-19. We achieved significant cost savings margin improvements and record adjusted earnings. And additionally we achieved all-time record operating cash flow., Growth, Cost Savings, Sales, Operating Cash Flow, Health and Safety, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s cover the details of the results starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That\\'s up slightly from a year ago and includes a four point drag from currency rates. Volumes were up 2% and net selling prices and product mix each improved one point. By segment, organic sales rose 14% in consumer tissue and 2% in personal care but declined 10% in K-C Professional. Mike will provide more color on the top line in just a few minutes., Growth, Sales, Net Selling Prices, Product Mix, Segment, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Moving on to profitability. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 39.8%, up 520 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 16%. We had outstanding cost savings performance in the quarter. Combined savings from our FORCE and restructuring program totaled $175 million, including strong productivity improvements. We are now targeting full year cost savings of $510 million to $560 million. That\\'s up nicely compared to our original range of $425 million to $500 million. Commodities were a benefit of $80 million in the quarter driven by pulp. We now expect full year commodity deflation of $150 million to $250 million. On average that\\'s $75 million better than our original outlook., Growth, Cost Savings, Profitability, Commodities, Target, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, On the other hand, foreign currencies were a headwind in the quarter, reducing our operating profit by a high single-digit rate. For the full year, currency effects are expected to be a high single-digit drag on operating profit. Versus our original plan, the incremental currency headwinds are about twice the benefit of the improved commodity outlook. Other manufacturing costs were also higher year-on-year. For the full year, these costs are expected to increase more than we originally planned. That\\'s due to incremental expenses related to COVID-19 partially offset by improved fixed cost absorption., Growth, Currency Effects, Manufacturing Costs, Commodity Outlook, COVID-19 Expenses, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Moving further down the P&L. Between the lines spending was up 40 basis points as a percent of sales, driven by a nice pickup in digital advertising. All-in-all, adjusted operating profit was up 28%. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, up 470 basis points versus year ago. Margins were up in all three business segments with significant improvement in consumer tissue. Consumer tissue margins included an approximate 175 basis point benefit from improved fixed cost absorption. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were a record $2.20, up 32% year-on-year., Growth, Digital Advertising, Margins, Segments, Earnings Per Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Let\\'s turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was an all-time record of nearly $1.6 billion, compared to $609 million in the year ago quarter. The increase was driven by unusually strong working capital benefits, higher earnings and a temporary delay in tax payments. While cash flow is expected to decline in the back half of the year, we expect full year cash flow will be up very nicely year-on-year., Cash Flow, Capital Efficiency, Working Capital, Tax Payments, Full Year, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Second quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled about $400 million. That was lower than normal because of our decision to temporarily suspend share repurchases for most of the second quarter. As we mentioned in this morning\\'s news release, we will be restarting our share repurchase program beginning tomorrow. All in all, we delivered very good results across the board, while continuing to invest for future success., Dividends, Share Repurchases, Second Quarter, Suspension, Future Success, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, Maria. Good morning everyone. I really want to wish you and your family\\'s good health and safety. I\\'ll begin by commenting on how we\\'re operating in the current environment and then I\\'ll turn to our results and the outlook. Now, since the outbreak of COVID-19, Kimberly Clark has taken decisive action to manage our business effectively through this crisis. Our key operating priorities remain as follows. First and foremost, we are focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and our consumers; second, we\\'re proactively managing our global supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products and third, we\\'re prudently managing the business through near-term volatility, while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly Clark., Health and Safety, Operating Priorities, Supply Chain Management, Long-Term Health, Crisis\\nManagement, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'m really proud of how our 40,000 employees are managing through the challenges we\\'re facing every day. Our global supply chain organization led by our frontline manufacturing employees is doing an outstanding job keeping our supply chain rolling. We have not experienced material impact even as we\\'ve had disruptions in several markets with elevated infection rates. Despite the tough environment, our teams continue to deliver strong cost savings and productivity improvements. While much of our attention has been on the near term, we are continuing to execute our longer-term strategies., Employee Management, Supply Chain Organization, Cost Savings, Productivity Improvements, Longer-\\nTerm Strategies, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our teams pivoted rapidly to pursue new growth opportunities, that have been created in the pandemic environment and this includes opportunities to better meet consumer and end-user needs around health, wellness and protection, both in home and in the workplace. It also includes opportunities to accelerate e-commerce and digital as consumers change how they engage with our brands. Now, I\\'d like to make a few comments about our results. As Maria mentioned, organic sales increased 4% in the quarter., Growth Opportunities, Consumer Needs, E-Commerce, Digital Engagement, Quarterly Results, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In North American consumer products, organic sales were up 12%. Now within that personal care rose 5% and that was driven by ongoing momentum on premium-tier Huggies, child care and baby wipes. In North American consumer tissue organic, sales increased 22%. Category demand was strong reflecting increased at-home consumption and some continued consumer stock-up in bath tissue. Category growth moderated in the latter part of the quarter. Shipments exceeded category demand especially in bath tissue as we work 24/7 to restore customer inventory levels.,  Huggies,  Child Care,  Baby Wipes,  North American Consumer Products,  Category\\nDemand, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to K-C Professional in North America, organic sales declined 3% and volumes fell 9%. This decline reflects the challenging environment. And I\\'ll note that we experienced strong shipments early in the quarter which included benefits from higher-than-normal customer orders in late March that were ultimately fulfilled in April. Now, by product category, second quarter volumes were down about 20% in washroom, down double digits in safety. Now volume was up double digits in wipers and other products.,  Sales decline,  Volumes fell,  Challenging environment,  Strong shipments,  Product\\ncategory, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Moving to D&E markets, sales were down 3%, driven primarily by K-C Professional. Personal care organic sales in D&E were up 2%. Now in key personal care markets, organic sales were up mid-teens in China and up double digits in India. In Eastern Europe, organic sales were up slightly, although results were impacted by some destocking and the impact of economic lockdowns. In Latin America, organic sales fell low single digits despite favorable pricing in Argentina. Category demand in many D&E countries has been impacted by a drop in consumer purchasing power and government restrictions on social mobility and store operations.,  Sales decline,  K-C Professional,  Personal care organic sales,  Key personal care\\nmarkets,  Economic lockdowns, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In developed markets, organic sales were up 3%, driven by strong growth in consumer tissue. Now, as you know, we\\'re also very focused on improving our market positions and we\\'re making good progress. Overall, we\\'re growing or maintaining market share in approximately 60% of our 80 category/country combinations that we track. In North American consumer products market shares are up or even in five of eight product categories. In D&E markets shares were up in Eastern Europe up or even in China and somewhat mixed in Latin America. In developed markets shares were up in South Korea and the U.K.,  Organic sales,  Consumer tissue,  Market positions,  Market share,  Product\\ncategories, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, So to summarize our first half, I\\'m very encouraged by our progress. We\\'re delivering strong financial results. We\\'re strengthening our market positions and we\\'re managing through this crisis safely and effectively. Now I\\'ll address the outlook. The duration and impact of COVID-19 on our business remains unclear and there continues to be uncertainty in the environment. However, our visibility is improving and we\\'re restoring forward-looking guidance for 2020.,  Progress,  Financial results,  Market positions,  Crisis management,  Outlook, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Compared to our original plan we\\'re raising our outlook for both organic sales and earnings. We\\'re also increasing growth investment, primarily in digital advertising. On the top line we\\'re targeting organic sales growth of 4% to 5% which is above our original plan of 2%. And this increase reflects a combination of improved underlying brand performance and higher demand driven by COVID.,  Outlook,  Organic sales growth,  Earnings,  Growth investment,  Digital\\nadvertising, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, A few additional thoughts about our second half organic outlook, we have good underlying momentum and we\\'ll continue to support our brands with strong advertising and innovation. New innovation includes launches on Pull-Ups in North America and feminine care in Eastern Europe Brazil and ASEAN. In addition, we expect bath tissue sales in North America will benefit from more people being at home and from our actions to improve customer inventory levels.,  Momentum,  Advertising,  Innovation,  New innovation,  Bath tissue sales, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We expect to continue facing challenging conditions in K-C Professional and in consumer categories in some D&E markets. We also expect to see additional consumer destocking in the second half. On the bottom line our revised outlook is adjusted earnings per share of $7.40 to $7.60. That\\'s up 7% to 10% year-on-year compared to our original plan of $7.10 to $7.35. While, we\\'re increasing our outlook we\\'ll also invest more in our brands and capabilities. We temporarily paused some investment in the second quarter and now plan to restore and further increase investment this year. We\\'re doing this to fuel market share momentum and to better position us for sustainable long-term success.,  Challenging conditions,  Consumer categories,  Destocking,  Adjusted earnings per\\nshare,  Investment, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, In conclusion, we remain very optimistic about our opportunities to generate long-term growth and create shareholder value. We\\'ll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our people and our consumers. We\\'re executing our strategies well and we continue to operate our business with a balanced and sustainable approach.,  Opportunities,  Growth,  Shareholder value,  Health and safety,  Strategies, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 2, Michael Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now that concludes our prepared remarks and now we\\'d be happy to take your questions.,  Prepared remarks,  Questions, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Paul Alexander, Investor Relations, Thank you, and good morning, everyone.

Lastly, we\\'ll be referring to adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.,  Forward-looking statements,  Risk Factors,  Adjusted results,  GAAP financial\\nmeasures,  News release, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. We joined you today during an unprecedented time and we hope all our stakeholders are staying healthy and safe. The COVID-19 crisis is severely affecting individuals and society at large and that\\'s forcing companies like ours to adapt to overcome near term operating challenges and uncertainty.,  Thank you,  Good morning,  COVID-19 crisis,  Adaptation,  Uncertainty, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kimberly Clark\\'s vision is to provide the world with essentials for a better life, and we know our consumers are counting on us now more than ever to fulfill that vision. We take this responsibility seriously and our teams are working around the clock to ensure our essential products get to our consumers who depend on us.,  Vision,  Consumers,  Essential products,  Responsibility,  Teams, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The K-C Foundation and our brands have launched programs to support COVID-19 relief efforts. And thus far, we provided donations of more than $8 million to organizations including UNICEF, the Red Cross, and the United Way. We\\'re also donating millions and millions of our products to other organizations and need.,  K-C Foundation,  COVID-19 relief efforts,  Donations,  Organizations,  Products, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we\\'ve taken decisive action to manage our business effectively through this crisis. We have three key operating priorities. Priority number one, protect the health and safety of our employees and our consumers. Throughout our 148-year history, this has never been more important than right now. We\\'ve taken aggressive action to protect our employees around the world, no matter where they work, that includes implementing extensive sanitization, quarantine and social distance protocols in our manufacturing facilities, work from home policies and of course, travel restrictions. We\\'re also recognizing our manufacturing employees with well deserve bonuses in appreciation of their efforts.,  COVID-19,  Business management,  Operating priorities,  Employee safety,  Bonuses, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Priority number two, proactively manage our global supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products to our consumers. Our supply chain teams are meeting multiple times each day to effectively navigate the dynamic environment. They\\'re doing a great job and keeping our global supply chain largely operational, in many cases delivering record output. We\\'re running our assets flat out and greatly simplifying our assortment to improve product availability. We\\'re working with raw material suppliers and distribution partners to ensure continuity and maximize deliveries. In some cases, we are incurring additional cost to keep the supply chain rolling. We have experienced some disruption, including temporary manufacturing slowdowns and shutdowns, but none have had material impact to date. The supply chain environment is dynamic, and we expect ongoing challenges in the near term. However, we are encouraged with our team\\'s ability thus far to manage effectively in the current environment.,  Supply chain teams,  Global supply chain,  Essential products,  Raw material\\nsuppliers,  Distribution partners, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Priority number three, prudently manage the business through near-term volatility, while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly Clark. We\\'ll continue to operate with a balanced perspective on both the top and bottom line as we assess both risk and opportunity. We\\'ll continue to invest in our products, our brands and our commercial capabilities to maintain the near-term health of our business and position us for long-term success. That said, some investment in brand support, including promotion activity will be deferred temporarily because it isn\\'t effective or appropriate in the current environment. While also manage our discretionary overhead even more tightly.,  Business management,  Volatility,  Investment,  Brand support,  Discretionary\\noverhead, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And as Maria will describe, we\\'ve taken additional steps to further strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility. While the environment continues to evolve rapidly, our teams are managing our priorities and our business well. I\\'m extremely proud of our entire K-C team and I want to express sincere thanks for how they are fulfilling our vision.,  Balance sheet,  Financial flexibility,  Business management,  Priorities,  Team, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Maria will take you through the results of the quarter, but as you can see from the release, we\\'re performing well, have a strong balance sheet and are delivering solid cash flow. In a few minutes, I\\'ll discuss the outlook and then open the call for your questions. But for now, I\\'ll turn it over to Maria.,  Quarterly results,  Balance sheet,  Cash flow,  Outlook,  Questions, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Okay. Thank you, Maria. Now, I\\'ll provide some forward-looking perspective. We\\'re focused on ensuring business continuity and we\\'re developing robust contingency plans to address a wide range of scenarios. I feel good about where we stand right now, but we\\'re navigating a very dynamic environment.,  Business continuity,  Contingency plans,  Dynamic environment,  Forward-looking\\nperspective,  Scenarios, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Due to the lack of visibility and uncertainty about the potential impact of the pandemic, including its potential effects on the global economy, our markets and our supply chain were temporarily suspending our forward-looking guidance. Now as the situation progresses and we get more visibility into the impact of the pandemic, we will resume guidance.,  Pandemic,  Global economy,  Markets,  Supply chain,  Forward-looking guidance, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Today, our teams have done an excellent job navigating through the volatility. However, the inherent unpredictability of the pandemic creates uncertainty and that makes it difficult for us to assess future outcomes with any precision. In addition, a volatility in currency, commodities and supply chain, there are effects on demand and I\\'ll share some perspective on that right now.,  Volatility,  Pandemic,  Uncertainty,  Currency,  Commodities, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Our essential categories have historically performed well in times of economic turbulence. In consumer, our underlying momentum is solid and we\\'re making strong progress on our strategic growth initiatives. We\\'ll continue to support our brands with innovation and marketing; near term innovation launches, include upgrades in Huggies in China, North America and Brazil, Kotex in Eastern Europe and Poise and Depend in North America.,  Essential categories,  Economic turbulence,  Strategic growth initiatives,  Innovation\\nlaunches,  Marketing support, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Consumption in the first quarter ran ahead of shipments, and as a result, we expect retailers will rebuild inventory and that will see additional volume in the second quarter, and we\\'re seeing that play out thus far in April.,  Inventory,  Retailers,  Volume,  Second quarter,  April, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We expect most, but not all of the demand increase from consumer stock-up will reverse out later in the year. However, with more people at home and also paying closer attention to personal hygiene, it\\'s likely the consumer tissue consumption will be higher during shelter-in-place periods.,  Demand increase,  Consumer stock-up,  Personal hygiene,  Shelter-in-place,  Tissue\\nconsumption, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also closely monitoring pandemic and economic conditions in D&E markets, including Latin America and evaluating how that could impact the health of our consumers and our categories.,  Pandemic,  Economic conditions,  D&E markets,  Latin America,  Consumers, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now shifting to K-C Professional, demand was solid in the first quarter and boosted by stock-up activity that occurred in March. Given the economic shock that\\'s occurred and with much of the population staying at home, KCP is likely to face volume decline starting in the second quarter that will persist until economic conditions return to more \"normal levels\". We\\'re seeing early signs of that softness thus far in April. Impacted end markets are likely to include, obviously, offices, travel/lodging, high traffic counts, including retail and manufacturing.,  Demand,  Stock-up activity,  Economic shock,  Volume decline,  Impacted end\\nmarkets, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Now, I\\'d like to conclude with a few important messages. First, we\\'re very confident in the strength, the resilience and the overall health of our company. We\\'re navigating near-term uncertainty well and appreciate the commitment of our K-C strong team. We\\'re managing prudently in the near term and strongly believe in our ability to create long-term shareholder value.,  Strength,  Resilience,  Health,  Company,  Shareholder value, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, And that concludes our prepared remarks and we\\'d be happy to take your questions.,  Prepared remarks,  Questions, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me echo Mike\\'s comments and say that I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during this global health crisis. I\\'d also like to thank our 40,000 employees for their incredible actions during this time period. I\\'ve never been more proud to work at this great company. How we\\'re managing through this crisis is, of course, the most important thing right now, but I do want to spend a few minutes reviewing our results.,  Global health crisis,  Company,  Employees,  Crisis management,  Results, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Overall, first quarter results reflect both significant volume increases from consumer stock-up as well as excellent execution by our teams. We generated strong cash flow and further strengthened our balance sheet. In addition, we continue to invest more in our business and our market share positions are in good shape.,  Volume increases,  Execution,  Cash flow,  Balance sheet,  Market share positions, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Let me cover some of the details of our results. First quarter net sales were $5 billion, that\\'s up 8% year-on-year. Organic sales increased 11%, while currencies were a 2-point drag. Volumes were up 8%, including significant shipments to support consumer stock-up related to the COVID-19 outbreak. That stock-up occurred in all major geographies and benefited all three business segments, in particular, consumer tissue. In addition, we were off to an excellent start to the year prior to the outbreak with good performance in several areas, that included premium-tier Huggies diapers and adult care in North America; personal care in Asia broadly, including China and also in Eastern Europe. Net selling prices in the quarter were up 1%, driven by increases taken last year. Overall, the pricing and promotion environment remained broadly constructive in the third quarter. Product mix improved 1%, reflecting our strategies to elevate our categories and drive trade-up.,  Net sales,  Organic sales,  Volumes,  Currencies,  Product mix, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Let me pause here and touch briefly on our market share positions. In North American consumer products, our first quarter market shares were up or even in 5 of 8 categories year-on-year, and up or even in 6 of 8 categories sequentially. In key D&E markets in personal care, market shares were up or even year-on-year in Eastern Europe, in China and in most categories in Brazil. Shares were down in some other countries in Latin America, including Peru; although our position there was stable sequentially. Overall, our market shares are broadly healthy, which is a good place to be in this environment.,  Market share positions,  North American consumer products,  Key D&E markets,  Eastern\\nEurope,  China, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Turning back to the financials. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 37.2%, up 370 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 20%. We had a strong quarter on cost savings with total savings of $125 million from our FORCE and restructuring programs. Commodities were a benefit of $115 million, somewhat better than we expected. Other manufacturing costs were higher year-on-year. Foreign currencies were somewhat worse than we expected and reduced operating profit at a high-single digit rate.,  Adjusted gross margin,  Adjusted gross profit,  Cost savings,  Commodities,  Other\\nmanufacturing costs, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Between-the-lines spending was up 100 basis points as a percent of net sales, including a nice step-up in advertising spending. Adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, up 250 basis points and adjusted operating profit grew 24%. The bottom line also benefited from a slightly lower tax rate, higher equity income and a lower share count. All in all, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $2.13, up 28%.,  Between-the-lines spending,  Advertising spending,  Adjusted operating margin, \\nAdjusted operating profit,  Adjusted earnings per share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s turn to cash flow restructuring in the balance sheet. Cash provided by operations was strong at $704 million compared to a soft quarter last year of $317 million. The year-on-year increase was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. Capital spending was $352 million in the quarter, including significant activity related to our restructuring. Looking ahead, some of our near-term capital projects and restructuring activities will be temporarily delayed or reprioritized because of the complexities of managing in the current environment. We now expect that charges for our restructuring program will continue into 2021, rather than wrapping up at the end of this year. We also expect the charges for the total program will be toward the high end of our previous estimate. We expect that total restructuring savings will be consistent with our previous estimate. Although it is possible that we won\\'t hit our full target until sometime in 2022. On capital allocation, first quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $575 million.,  Cash provided by operations,  Capital spending,  Restructuring charges,  Total\\nrestructuring savings,  Capital allocation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, We are prudently managing and further strengthening our already strong balance sheet and liquidity position in this environment, and our liquidity overall remains robust. It is also our intention to maintain our single A credit rating through this temporary period of uncertainty. We executed two long-term debt transactions in the quarter. The first was $500 million 30-year bond offering that essentially pre-funded the $500 million of notes that will come due in August. In late March, we executed a second transaction, this one, a $750 million 10-year bond offering. That transaction enhanced our overall liquidity and flexibility and reduced our near-term need for commercial paper.,  Balance sheet,  Liquidity position,  Credit rating,  Long-term debt transactions, \\nNear-term need for commercial paper, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, We also continue to maintain two revolving credit facilities totaling $2.75 billion that we\\'ve never drawn upon. We\\'re also temporarily suspending our share repurchase program for at least the remainder of the second quarter to provide additional flexibility. We\\'ll continue to monitor the uncertainty in the environment and we\\'ll give you another update on share repurchases in July. Longer term, there has been no change in our capital allocation strategies.,  Revolving credit facilities,  Share repurchase program,  Capital allocation strategies,\\n Uncertainty in the environment,  Update on share repurchases, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll finish with some perspectives on the currency and commodity markets. We originally expected that currencies would reduce our net sales by 1 point this year. Using first quarter actuals and forward rates at the end of March, the headwind would be approximately 4% and rates remain volatile on a daily basis. For your benefit, on a historical basis, the currency impact on our operating profit, taking into account both translation and transaction effects has typically been two to three times the impact on our sales. In addition, our equity affiliate K-C de Mexico is facing many of the same uncertainties that we are, including a much weaker Mexican peso. Improving net realized revenue remains one of our strategies to offset currency headwinds. However, in this environment, much of new incremental price realization will occur -- how much, I\\'m sorry, much incremental price realization will occur in the near term is more uncertain than normal.,  Currency impact,  Commodity markets,  Net sales,  Operating profit,  Equity\\naffiliate K-C de Mexico, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, On the commodity front, forward-looking trends look favorable, other markets remain volatile. And as usual, cost changes could impact the promotion environment. Raw material markets that can be influenced by oil, including resin, have started to move down some recently, although much less than the decline in oil, and where oil goes from here is certainly unclear. On pulp, recent industry forecast for North America eucalyptus market prices are in the lower half of the range we used to set our full-year plan in January, which was $900 to $975 per metric ton.,  Commodity front,  Raw material markets,  Oil,  Pulp,  North America eucalyptus\\nmarket prices, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2020, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, So all in all, I\\'m encouraged by our execution in the quarter. And our balance sheet, our business fundamentals and our financial health are all strong. I\\'ll now hand it back to Mike., Financial Health, Business Fundamentals, Execution, Balance Sheet, Handover, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Paul Alexander, Investor Relations, Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s Year End Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and CEO; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here is the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with a review of full-year 2019 results. Mike will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for 2020. We will finish as usual with Q&A., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Agenda, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Paul Alexander, Investor Relations, We have a presentation of today\\'s materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we\\'ll be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both exclude certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures., Financial Health, Business Fundamentals, Execution, Balance Sheet, Risk Factors, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Paul. And good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Let me start with the headlines on our full-year results. Organic sales increased 4%, driven by higher net selling prices. We achieved strong margin improvements and bottom line growth, while increasing our brand investments. And we improved capital efficiency and return significant cash to shareholders., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s cover the details of our results starting with sales. Full-year net sales were $18.5 billion. That\\'s even year-on-year and included a 3-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales were up 4%. Looking at the topline by geography. In North America, organic sales in consumer products increased 3%. Within that, Personal Care grew 4% with positive volumes, pricing and mix. Consumer Tissue grew 2% with selling prices up 7% and volumes down 5%. In KC Professional in North America, organic sales increased 3%, driven by higher prices in all major product categories. In Developing & Emerging markets, organic sales rose 6%. That included about 2.5 points from Argentina., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of key Personal Care markets, organic sales increased 20% in Eastern Europe and high-single-digits in Brazil, China, and ASEAN. Outside of Brazil and Argentina, we experienced increased volatility and soft results in Latin America, particularly in the second half of the year in Peru, Bolivia and Chile. In Developed Markets outside of North America, organic sales rose 1%., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Moving on to profitability. Full-year adjusted gross margin was 35%, up 180 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 5%. We generated $425 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs. That was right in line with our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October. For 2020, we\\'re targeting to deliver between $425 million to $500 million in total cost savings, and that includes $325 million to $375 million from FORCE., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Commodities were a drag of $145 million in 2019, although they turn favorable in the back half of the year. Foreign currencies were also a headwind, reducing operating profit at a high-single-digit rate. For 2020, we expect commodities will be somewhat favorable, mostly offset by currency headwinds, particularly in Latin America. Other manufacturing costs were also higher in 2019., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Moving further down the P&L. Between-the-lines spending was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales. That included higher advertising spending, which was up 60 basis points. SG&A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation, along with capability-building investments. Adjusted operating margin was 17.8%, up 80 basis points, and adjusted operating profit grew 5%. Operating margins were up nicely in all three business segments, led by consumer tissue and secondarily KC Professional., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, The adjusted effective tax rate was in line with plan and a drag year-on-year, partially offset by higher equity income and a lower share count. In total, full-year adjusted earnings per share were $6.89, up 4%. Our October guidance was for earnings of $6.75 to $6.90. And our original outlook last January was for earnings of $6.50 to $6.70., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Now, let\\'s turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was $2.7 billion, down year-on-year as expected and driven by higher working capital. We expect a solid increase in cash flow this year, driven by higher earnings. Capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2019, in line with plan and up year-on-year, due to supply chain restructuring projects. Spending will remain elevated in 2020 because of our restructuring. We improved adjusted return on invested capital by 70 basis points to 27.2%, which is an all-time high. On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.2 billion. That\\'s the ninth consecutive year we\\'ve returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. We expect to return a similar level of cash to shareholders in 2020. And our Board has already approved our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program. Overall, we\\'ve made significant progress as we close out the second year of this program. The implementation of our redesigned overhead organization has gone very well, and we\\'ve already realized most of the total program SG&A savings. In terms of supply chain, activities continue to ramp up. We\\'ve announced seven of the approximately 10 facilities that we expect to close or sell, and we\\'ve taken action on six of those. In 2020, we will start up approximately 20 new assets globally, which is roughly twice the level of activity that we would have in a typical year., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Looking at the key metrics. We\\'re about 70% to 75% of the ways through pre-tax charges and workforce reductions. Cash payments are about 65% complete. And on savings, we accelerated savings in both 2018 and 2019. And so far, we\\'ve generated $300 million of savings compared to our total program target of $500 million to $550 million by the end of 2021. So overall, it was a very good year, and I\\'m pleased that we deliver top and bottom line growth ahead of our plan, while we invested more in the business for the long term., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Balance Sheet, Cash Return, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying, I\\'m encouraged by our results and the progress we made in the first year of executing K-C Strategy 2022. On the top line, organic sales were up 4% in \\'19, ahead of our original plan for 2% growth. Our team has maintained strong focus on price realization and executed their plans well throughout the year. As a result, pricing was up 4%. And that\\'s the highest realization we\\'ve achieved in a decade and it was necessary because of the multi-year inflation that we faced., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Pricing, Inflation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Our strategy is to elevate our categories and drive trade-up also helped us improve product mix by 1 point. While volumes were down 1%. That was better than our original expectation because of strong end-market execution, higher brand investment and less impact from price increases. Beyond sales, we delivered broad-based margin improvements and above plan earnings. We continue to leverage our financial and capital discipline as we achieved significant cost savings, improved ROIC and returned significant cash to shareholders., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Pricing, Inflation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, We also invested more in our brands and businesses in 2019. As Maria noted, we increased advertising spending by 60 basis points. Digital advertising is now about two-thirds of our working media mix, and it\\'s helping us target consumers more effectively and deploy our campaigns more quickly. We\\'re leveraging our digital expertise and more businesses around the world, and our marketing ROI is improving. Importantly, our digital strategy is helping us grow volumes and businesses like in fem care internationally, diapers in Eastern Europe, and adult care in North America., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Pricing, Inflation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Now, beyond advertising, we\\'ve also started to invest behind and focus more on improving our other commercial capabilities, including revenue management. We\\'re taking a disciplined program management approach to this effort. This includes making sure we have the right tools, processes and resources, so we can better leverage these growth capabilities. While it\\'s still early days, we\\'re making good progress and I expect more going forward. All-in-all, our teams have made excellent progress in 2019. And I\\'m proud of their accomplishments., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Pricing, Inflation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Now, I\\'ll turn to our outlook for 2020. Our plan is consistent with our balanced approach to value creation, includes higher growth investments and aligns with our K-C Strategy 2022 financial objectives. On the top line, we\\'re targeting organic sales growth of 2%, and that\\'s consistent with our medium-term objective and similar to our expectation for category growth. We expect selling prices, product mix and volumes to all improve in 2020. Pricing should be weighted to the front half of the year, while volume growth will likely be more weighted to the back half. We expect the promotion environment to be competitive, but remain broadly constructive. We will continue to increase our growth investment in 2020, and that includes investment in digital marketing, in our commercial capabilities and in our products as part of our innovation agenda., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Pricing, Inflation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, In the first half, we will launch innovations in North America on Huggies diapers and adult care and on Cottonelle bathroom tissue. In D&E, we have several upgrades coming in Personal Care in key markets such as China, Eastern Europe and Latin America. We\\'re confident our growth investments and innovations will help us grow volume and improve product mix this year, and improve share performance over time. Our investments will start right away in the first quarter, while the benefits should build as the year progresses. We\\'re targeting to grow adjusted operating profit 3% to 5% and on average, that implies 50 basis points of our operating margin expansion. Gross margin should increase more than that. On the bottom line, we\\'re targeting adjusted earnings per share of $7.10 to $7.35. At the midpoint, that represents growth of 5%, in line with our K-C Strategy 2022 objective. Finally, as Maria said, we expect to improve cash flow and return significant amounts of cash to shareholders., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Innovation, Growth, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, So in summary, I\\'m encouraged by our progress in 2019 and our outlook for 2020. We\\'re investing more in the business to drive long-term success, and we\\'re confident in our ability to deliver balanced and sustainable growth and create shareholder value., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 4, Michael D. Hsu, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Now that concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we\\'d be happy to take your questions., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Paul Alexander, Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here is the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of second quarter results. After that, Mike will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We\\'ll finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today\\'s materials in the Investors section of our website., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Paul Alexander, Vice President, Investor Relations, As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we\\'ll be referring to adjusted results and outlook, which exclude certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 5% driven by higher net selling prices. We achieved strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And finally, we\\'re broadly on track with our overall capital plan and we continue to return cash to shareholders., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s cover the details of our results starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That\\'s even with a year ago and includes a five-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales were up 5% compared to flat performance in the base period. Net selling prices increased 5% and product mix improved one point, while volumes fell slightly. Mike will provide some more color in our top line in just a few minutes., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Moving on to profitabilit. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.6%, up 120 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 3% (Technical Difficulty). We now expect full year commodity inflation of $150 million to $250 million. On average that\\'s $150 million lower than our previous estimate. The reduction is driven primarily by cost and secondarily other raw materials., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Other manufacturing costs also increased in the quarter compared to a relatively modest level last year. These costs are expected to be a bit higher than we planned for, for the full year. Moving further down the P&L, between the lines spending was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales. That included higher advertising as we\\'re investing more behind our brands, particularly in digital. G&A expense also increased, driven by higher incentive compensation., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, For the full year, because we\\'ve raised our sales and earnings outlook, we\\'ve also increased our incentive compensation estimate. The increase versus our original plan is equal to more than 1% of total operating profit. About half of that increase was reflected in our second quarter results., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Foreign currencies were also a headwind in the quarter, reducing operating profit by a high-single digit rate. All in all, adjusted operating profit was up 2%. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.2%, up 40 basis points versus a year ago. That included broad-based margin improvements in all three business segments., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.67, up 5% year-on-year. In addition to the higher operating profit, the bottom line benefited from a slightly lower adjusted effective tax rate, higher equity income and a lower share count., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Let\\'s turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $609 million compared to $787 million in the year ago quarter. The decrease was generally in line with our expectations and driven by higher tax payments and increased working capital. Capital spending was $253 million in the quarter. As expected that\\'s up versus last year, driven by supply chain restructuring projects. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. Second quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled $520 million and we continue to expect that full year amount will be between $2 billion and $2.3 billion., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Looking at our segment results, in Personal Care, organic sales were up 8%. Net selling prices increased 5% and volumes and product mix were each up one point. Personal Care operating margins were 21.2%, up 80 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth and cost savings., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up 4%. Net selling prices increased 5% and product mix improved slightly, while volumes fell 2%. Consumer Tissue operating margins were 15%, up 90 basis points versus year ago with significant benefits from higher pricing., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, In K-C Professional, organic sales grew 1%. Selling prices rose 3% and product mix improved a point [while volumes were down 3%. K-C Professional operating margins of 19.7% were up 50 basis points versus prior year. So all in all, we delivered very good results in the quarter while continuing to invest for future success., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Okay. Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying we made excellent progress in the second quarter. We\\'re executing our 2019 plan well with a strong focus on price realization to improve our margins. We\\'re launching innovations investing more in our brands and pursuing growth priorities for longer term success. We\\'re also continuing to return significant cash to shareholders., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, As Maria just mentioned, we delivered 5% organic sales growth in the second quarter and while that compares to a soft year ago, this was our best performance in over three years. Our pricing initiatives are on track. Our volumes are ahead of expectations both in terms of the impact from price increases and from our growth initiatives. We also continue to improve mix, which was up one point for the second consecutive quarter., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Let me share some of the top line highlights starting in North America. Organic sales in consumer products increased 5% compared to a 2-point decline last year. Year-to-date, organic sales were up 3%, which is likely a better reflection of our ongoing performance. Growth in the quarter was driven by 4% higher selling prices. Our pricing plans are on track. Volumes in North America were up slightly overall. Adult care volumes were up high-single digits and we recently launched innovations on both Poise and Depend to keep that momentum going., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Earlier this month, we launched Huggies Special Delivery, our new super premium diaper. Special Delivery uses the best of our technology from around the world. This is our softest diaper. It\\'s made with plant-based materials and provides ultimate skin comfort. It\\'s also premium priced and a great example of our elevate the core strategy in action. In North American consumer K-C Professional, organic sales increased 2%, driven by disciplined execution of our pricing initiatives., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Turning to developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 9% and that included 3.5 points of growth from Argentina, which is consistent with our plan. In terms of our key personal care businesses, in Brazil, organic sales were up double digits driven by higher selling prices. While category volumes remain sluggish, we\\'re driving strong growth through disciplined market execution and focused expansion efforts in baby wipes and adult care., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, In China, organic sales were up double-digits compared to a soft performance last year. In diapers, our net price realization was helped by reduced and more targeted promotional spending. While Huggies total volumes were down, the product innovations we\\'ve launched are delivering growth in the premium end of our lineup and improving mix significantly. In fem care, we had another strong quarter and we\\'re on track to achieve 20%-plus organic growth for the third consecutive year., Business Fundamentals, Financial Health, Execution, Growth, Innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, In ASEAN, organic sales rose about 10% with continued volume strength on Huggies diapers in Vietnam. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased about 20%, driven by double-digit volume growth and positive pricing. Our momentum on both Huggies and Kotex reflects excellent sales execution, winning product innovation and great marketing.,  Sales,  Volume,  Marketing,  Product Innovation,  Momentum, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Finally, in developed markets outside North America, organic sales were up 1% with solid performance in South Korea and Australia. Beyond sales, I\\'m very encouraged with the margin improvement we\\'ve delivered while investing more in our business.,  Sales,  Margin Improvement,  Investment,  Performance in South Korea and\\nAustralia,  Beyond sales, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Now turning to the full year. We\\'re raising our outlook on both the top and bottom line. On the top line, we\\'re increasing our organic sales outlook to 3%, and that\\'s one point higher than our original plan and driven by stronger volumes. On the bottom line. We\\'re now targeting adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 to $6.80, and that compares favorably to our prior outlook of $6.50 to $6.70. Our updated outlook reflects strong execution, the improving commodity environment and higher reinvestment levels. We\\'re encouraged that the commodity outlook has gotten better, and that\\'s especially true for pulp, which has retreated from all time high levels although costs remain elevated from a longer term perspective.,  Outlook,  Sales,  Volumes,  Commodity Environment,  Reinvestment Levels, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, We aren\\'t expecting a significant increase in market promotion activity despite the improved commodity environment, but we\\'ll continue to closely monitor competitive activity. We\\'re increasing growth investments in our brands and commercial capabilities to position us better for the long-term success. Brand investments include more digital advertising, digital continues to improve marketing ROI and help us grow in many parts of our business. We\\'re also going to invest to improve our commercial capabilities, including revenue management, which is a focus of K-C Strategy 2022. Overall, we expect to bring some of the commodity benefits to the bottom line while also reinvesting more for top line growth. That\\'s consistent with our balanced value creation model we outlined in K-C Strategy 2022.,  Growth Investments,  Commercial Capabilities,  Brand Investments,  Digital\\nAdvertising,  Revenue Management, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 2, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, So in summary, we\\'ve made excellent progress in the first half. We\\'re raising our full year outlook and investing more for the long-term, and we\\'re confident in our ability to create shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we\\'ll be glad to take your questions.,  Outlook,  Progress,  Investment,  Long-term,  Shareholder Value, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Paul Alexander, Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here is the agenda for our call. Maria will start with a review of first quarter results. After that, Mike will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We\\'ll finish as usual with Q&A. We have a presentation of today\\'s materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we\\'ll be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both exclude certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.,  Agenda,  Review of Results,  Perspectives on Results,  Outlook for Full Year,  Q&A, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 3% driven by higher net selling prices. Adjusted operating profit and earnings per share were down low-single digits year-on-year. That said, we made solid progress with our margins compared to full-year 2018 performance. Additionally, we\\'re on track with our overall capital plan and we continue to return cash to shareholders. Now let\\'s cover the details of our results starting with sales. Our first quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that\\'s down 2% year-on-year with a 5 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales were up 3%, which is a good start relative to our full-year target for 2% growth. Net selling prices increased 4% and product mix improved 1% while volumes fell 2%. Mike will provide more color on our topline in just a few minutes.,  Sales,  Organic Sales,  Net Selling Prices,  Product Mix,  Volumes, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Moving on to profitability. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 33.5%, down 30 basis points year-on-year. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.4%, even with a year ago. I\\'m encouraged that gross and operating margins were up 30 basis points and 40 basis points respectively compared to full-year 2018 level. Commodities were a year-on-year drag of $135 million in the quarter. While that is still a meaningful amount, I was pleased to see market prices in North America for pulp, recycled fiber, and polymer fall a bit sequentially. Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit by a low double-digit rate. Our focus on achieving higher net selling prices offset much of the commodity and currency headwinds we faced in the quarter. We also generated solid cost savings of $115 million. That includes $55 million of FORCE savings, which was consistent with our plan, and $60 million of restructuring savings.,  Adjusted Gross Margin,  Adjusted Operating Margin,  Commodity Drag,  Foreign\\nCurrency Headwind,  Cost Savings, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, On that, we continue to make good progress with our restructuring program. So far this year, we\\'ve announced the planned closure of two personal care facilities outside North America. We\\'ve now announced six of the approximate 10 facilities that we intend to close or sell. Advertising spending was up in the quarter as we continued to support our brands. Even with that investment, total between-the-line spending was down 50 basis points to 16% of sales. The reduction was driven by our restructuring savings. Compared to the first quarter, I expect between-the-line spending as a percent of sales to move up a bit for the full year. So all in all, adjusted operating profit was down 2%. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.66, down 3% year-on-year. That included an approximate 2% drag from a higher tax rate essentially offset by a lower share count.,  Restructuring Program,  Facilities Closure or Sale,  Advertising Spending, \\nBetween-the-Line Spending,  Tax Rate, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Let\\'s turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the quarter was $317 million compared to $542 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was generally in line with our expectations and driven by higher working capital and restructuring payments. Capital spending was $316 million in the quarter. As expected, that\\'s up from $189 million in the year-ago period and is driven by supply chain restructuring projects. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. First quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled $510 million and we continue to expect the full-year amount will be between $2 billion and $2.3 billion. Turning to our segments. In Personal Care, organic sales were up 5%. Net selling prices increased 2% and volumes and product mix were each up more than 1 point. Personal Care operating margins were 21.3%, up 90 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth and cost savings.,  Cash Flow,  Capital Spending,  Dividends and Share Repurchases,  Segments\\n(Personal Care),  Operating Margins, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were even with the year-ago period. Net selling prices increased 6%, which was offset by lower volume. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 15.8% were even year-on-year. In K-C Professional, organic sales grew 3%. Selling prices rose 3% while a 1 point improvement in mix was offset by lower volumes. K-C Professional operating margins of 18.4% were down 60 basis points. Results were impacted by commodity inflation and currency headwinds, partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings. So all in all, we\\'re off to a solid start relative to our full-year plan and I\\'m encouraged by our progress.,  Consumer Tissue,  Organic Sales,  Net Selling Prices,  Volume,  Operating\\nMargins, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, I\\'ll now turn the call over to Mike for his perspective on our results and outlook.,  Sales,  Organic Sales,  Net Selling Prices,  Product Mix,  Volumes, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Great. Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. I\\'m going to focus my comments on organic sales and our full-year outlook. Let me start by saying I\\'m encouraged by our first quarter results. We\\'re making strong progress realizing higher selling prices; we\\'re launching innovations, investing in our brands, and pursuing our growth priorities; and we\\'re leveraging our strong financial discipline. As Maria just mentioned, we grew organic sales 3% in the first quarter, which is a good start to the year. Overall, our pricing initiatives are on track and to date the impact on our volumes has been reasonable. Let me share some of the topline highlights for the quarter starting in developed markets. Organic sales increased 1% in North America consumer products. ln North American Personal Care, organic sales grew 3%. Volumes increased high single digits in adult care with benefits from innovations, increased brand investment, and category growth.,  Sales,  Organic Sales,  Pricing Initiatives,  Volume,  Financial\\nDiscipline, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Volumes were up low single digits across our baby and child care portfolio. In the first quarter, we increased selling prices on Pull-Ups training pants and premium Huggies diapers. Looking ahead, we have innovation on Poise pads coming this quarter and premium innovation on Huggies diapers that are going to hit the market this summer. In North American Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2% compared to a 5% increase last year that was driven by strong promotion activity. Net selling prices rose 7%. Our pricing plans are overall on track. We\\'ll continue to monitor the impact on our volumes and competitive activity, but we remain focused and confident on realizing the benefits of the price increases. In North American K-C Professional, organic sales increased 1% driven by solid price realization.,  Volumes,  Selling Prices,  Price Realization,  Competitive Activity,  North\\nAmerican K-C Professional, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Turning to developed markets outside North America, organic sales were up 1%. In South Korea, while our diaper business continues to be impacted by a lower birth rate, our other businesses are growing and offsetting that diaper category softness. We also had solid performance in Western and Central Europe in K-C Professional. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 7% overall and that included nearly 3 points of growth from Argentina, which is consistent with our 2019 plan. In terms of our key personal care businesses, in Brazil organic sales rose about 15% compared to a mid single-digit increase in the base period. Growth was driven by higher selling prices while category volume remained sluggish. In China, organic sales were down high single-digits. Huggies diapers continues to be impacted by competitive price reductions that started last year. Nonetheless, volumes on our premium-tier Huggies were up driven by strong product innovation.,  Developed Markets,  South Korea,  Western and Central Europe,  Argentina, \\nChina, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, In Feminine care, we continued to grow at double-digit rates driven by our innovation, trade-up strategies, and supported by strong digital marketing. In ASEAN, organic sales rose about 10% with the strength on Huggies diapers in Vietnam. We\\'re rolling out improved Huggies in most ASEAN markets this year. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased about 20% with volumes and selling prices both up nicely. Our momentum in this region reflects the combination of excellent sales execution, winning product innovation backed by great marketing. We\\'re launching further innovations on Huggies and Kotex this year. While diapers remain our biggest business in D&E, I\\'m pleased that in the first quarter we grew organic sales double-digits in fem care, adult care, and baby wipes. These businesses have strong growth opportunity and we\\'re making progress. Now in terms of digital marketing, we\\'re using digital on many of our brands to help us build one-to-one consumer relationships.,  Feminine Care,  ASEAN,  Eastern Europe,  Digital Marketing,  D&E, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Digital is improving our marketing ROI and helping us grow in markets like fem care in China and South Korea, diapers in Vietnam, and adult care in North America. To summarize our topline, I\\'m optimistic about our start to the year. We have more work to do and we continue to operate in a competitive environment. However, that said, I\\'m encouraged with our progress thus far. Now moving beyond sales, I\\'ll just build briefly on Maria\\'s comments about margins. While we need to make more progress, I\\'m encouraged that first quarter performance was above our full-year 2018 levels.,  Digital Marketing,  Fem Care in China,  South Korea,  Diapers in Vietnam, \\nAdult Care in North America, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Turning to the outlook. As we mentioned in this morning\\'s news release, we\\'re confirming our previous outlook for 2019, which calls for 2% organic sales growth and adjusted earnings per share of $6.50 to $6.70. We\\'re also maintaining the key planning assumptions we outlined in January.,  Outlook,  Organic Sales Growth,  Adjusted Earnings Per Share,  Planning\\nAssumptions,  Key Planning Assumptions, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Our first quarter results has improved our earnings profile somewhat compared to our initial view of the year. That said, we still believe it\\'s more likely that earnings are going to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Our teams have a lot to execute over the next nine months and we\\'re going to continue to closely watch the overall environment. While we work to achieve our 2019 targets, we\\'ll continue to pursue the longer-term balanced and sustainable growth opportunities that are all part of our K-C Strategy 2022. So in summary, we\\'re off to a solid start for the year. We\\'re confirming our full-year outlook and we\\'re confident in our ability to create shareholder value.,  Earnings Profile,  Second Half of the Year,  Longer-term Growth Opportunities, \\nK-C Strategy 2022,  Full-Year Outlook, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2019, 1, Michael D. Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, That concludes our prepared remarks and now we\\'d be happy to take your questions.,  Prepared Remarks,  Questions,  Outlook,  Growth Opportunities,  Strategy\\n2022, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Paul Alexander, Vice President of Investor Relations, Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s year-end earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our chief executive officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. This morning, Maria will discuss our 2018 results and 2019 outlook.,  Year-End Earnings Conference Call,  Kimberly Clark,  CEO Mike Hsu,  CFO Maria\\nHenry,  2018 Results and 2019 Outlook, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Paul Alexander, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mike will then talk about our medium-term strategic priorities and financial objectives. Our remarks will be a little longer than normal this morning but we\\'ll finish as usual with Q&A. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements.,  Medium-term Strategic Priorities,  Financial Objectives,  Forward-Looking\\nStatements,  Risk Factors,  Annual Report on Form 10-K, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Paul Alexander, Vice President of Investor Relations, Lastly, we\\'ll be referring to adjusted results and outlook both exclude certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now I\\'ll turn the call over to Maria.,  Adjusted Results,  Outlook,  Items Described,  News Release, \\nReconciliations, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines on our full-year results.,  Full-Year Results,  Headlines,  Call Today, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, We delivered 3% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and a 1% increase for the full year, consistent with our target. It was a challenging macro environment and our profitability was impacted by significant commodity inflation and currency volatility. Nonetheless, we delivered significant cost savings and achieved higher selling prices in the second half of the year and we improved capital efficiency and returned significant cash to shareholders. Now let\\'s take a look at the details of our results.,  Organic Sales Growth,  Macro Environment,  Profitability,  Cost Savings, \\nCapital Efficiency, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Starting with sales, full-year net sales were $18.5 billion of 1%, organic sales rose 1%, and that included about 2 points of positive pricing in the second half of the year. Looking at the top line by geography, in North America, organic sales in consumer products increased 1%. That was driven by an increase of more than 1% in personal care, including solid volume growth in baby care and adult care. In KC Professional in North America, organic sales increased 3%, driven by higher volumes in all major product categories.,  Sales,  Net Sales,  Organic Sales,  Pricing,  Geometry, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, In developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 2%. In terms of key personal care markets, organic sales increased double digits in Eastern Europe and Asian, and mid-single digits in Latin America but fell low teens in China. In developed markets outside of North America, organic sales rose 1%. Moving on to profitability, full-year gross margin was 33.2%, down 270 basis points year on year.,  Organic Sales,  Profitability,  Gross Margin,  Key Personal Care Markets, \\nDeveloped Markets, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Commodities were a drag of $795 million. That was an all time high and well above our initial planning assumption coming into 2018 of $300 million to $400 million. Foreign currencies were also a headwind. Those two factors combined reduced operating profit by a high 20s percent.,  Commodities,  Foreign Currencies,  Operating Profit,  Planning Assumption, \\nPercentage Reduction, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, We delivered full-year cost savings of $510 million, including our FORCE and restructuring program. Restructuring savings $135 million, well above our initial target of $50 million to $70 million. We made excellent progress in the first year of this program and we remain on track with our overall plan. While FORCE cost savings of $375 million were substantial, we did have a soft fourth quarter.,  Full-Year Cost Savings,  FORCE Program,  Restructuring Savings,  Initial\\nTarget,  Soft Fourth Quarter, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Performance in the quarter included elevated transportation and distribution costs in North America, particularly in Consumer Tissue, along with some higher manufacturing-related operating costs. These factors are controllable for us and we will manage through them as we go through 2019. Moving down the P&L. Between the line spending fell 130 basis points as a percent of net sales, reflecting restructuring benefits, tight management of discretionary spending, and secondarily, lower incentive compensation.,  Transportation Costs,  Distribution Costs,  Manufacturing-Related Operating Costs,  Line Spending,  Incentive Compensation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted operating margin was 17%, down 140 basis points, and adjusted operating profit fell 7%. Our adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 was 21%. That was down significantly year on year and below our original plan. Full-year adjusted earnings per share were $6.61, up 6% year on year and driven by the lower tax rate.,  Adjusted Operating Margin,  Adjusted Operating Profit,  Adjusted Effective Tax Rate,  Full-Year Adjusted Earnings Per Share,  Lower Tax Rate, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Our October guidance was for earnings per share of $6.60 to $6.80. Now let\\'s turn the cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was $3 billion, up slightly year on year. We reduced working capital cash conversion cycle by five days and we improved adjusted return on invested capital by 240 basis points, ending the year at 26.5%.,  Earnings Per Share,  Cash Provided By Operations,  Working Capital Cash Conversion\\nCycle,  Adjusted Return On Invested Capital,  Year-On-Year, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.2 billion. That\\'s the eighth consecutive year we\\'ve returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. Now let me turn to our 2019 outlook. We expect the environment will remain challenging although somewhat better than in 2018.,  Capital Allocation,  Dividends,  Share Repurchases,  2019 Outlook, \\nEnvironment, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re targeting to deliver a solid improvement in our operating performance. That includes higher organic sales growth compared to our 2018 performance and improved operating profit and margin. On the top line, total sales are expected to decline 1% to 2%. That includes an expected 3% to 4% headwind from currencies.,  Operating Performance,  Organic Sales Growth,  Operating Profit and Margin, \\nTotal Sales,  Currency Headwind, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, We plan to grow organic sales by 2%. That\\'s similar to our expectation for overall market growth. We expect higher net selling prices of at least 3%. Our progress in the back half of 2018 with price realization bodes well for our 2019 plan.,  Organic Sales Growth,  Net Selling Prices,  Price Realization,  Back Half Of\\n2018,  2019 Plan, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Given the overall level of pricing we expect to achieve, we\\'re planning for some negative volume impacts, particularly in Consumer Tissue. We have a number of innovation launches in our plan and we will support our brands with strong marketing programs. Moving beyond sales, we plan to grow adjusted operating profit by 1% to 4%. At the midpoint of our guidance targets, that implies margin improvement of 70 basis points.,  Pricing,  Volume Impacts,  Innovation Launches,  Marketing Programs, \\nAdjusted Operating Profit and Margin Improvement, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, On average, we expect commodities and currencies in total will be a headwind on operating profit of about 20%, including a high single-digit drag from currency rate. We expect to offset much of that with higher pricing. We expect commodity inflation of $300 to 400 million. That\\'s much less than we experienced in 2018, which we believe represented a cyclical peak in terms of year-on-year headwind.,  Commodities,  Currencies,  Operating Profit,  Pricing,  Commodity\\nInflation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re targeting to deliver $400 to 450 million of total cost savings. That includes for savings of $300 million to $325 million and restructuring savings of $100 million to $125 million. Our fourth target reflects lower value generated from our commodity contracts versus what we have achieved over the last couple of years. Outside of this, we expect strong performance on the other components of our FORCE program.,  Total Cost Savings,  Savings,  Commodity Contracts,  FORCE Program,  Strong\\nPerformance, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, In addition, supply chain-related restructuring activities and savings will be ramping up in 2019. Overall, we continue to have high confidence in our ability to deliver healthy levels of supply chain savings going forward. We expect the adjusted effective tax rate will return to a more normal level and be between 23% and 25%. At the midpoint, that represents a year-on-year earnings drag of about 3.5%.,  Supply Chain Restructuring,  Savings,  Adjusted Effective Tax Rate,  Earnings\\nDrag,  Normal Level, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, All in all, we\\'re targeting full-year adjusted earnings per share of $6.50 to $6.70, which at the midpoint is essentially even year on year. In terms of our earnings profile, we expect earnings will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. That\\'s primarily because of the expected timing of the net benefit from selling price increases. Finally, on cash flow and capital allocation, we expect cash provided by operations will be slightly below our strong performance in 2018.,  Adjusted Earnings Per Share,  Second Half Of The Year,  Net Benefit From Selling\\nPrice Increases,  Cash Provided By Operations,  Capital Allocation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Maria Henry, Chief Financial Officer, We expect to allocate between $2 billion and $2.3 billion to dividends and share repurchases. We plan to repurchase $600 million to $900 million of Kimberly Clark stock. In addition, we\\'re increasing our dividend by 3%. That\\'s our 47th consecutive annual increase in the dividend., Dividends, Share Repurchases, Stock Repurchase, Dividend Increase, Consecutive Annual Dividend\\nIncrease, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Maria, walked you through our results and 2019 outlook. And while we aren\\'t satisfied with our margin in 2018, I was encouraged with the following: we returned to delivering organic sales growth and improved net selling prices in the second half, including strong fourth-quarter performance; our market share positions improved in about half of the 80 category country combinations that we track; we leveraged our financial discipline; and we made excellent progress on our global restructuring., Organic Sales Growth, Net Selling Prices, Market Share Positions, Financial Discipline, Global\\nRestructuring, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Since this is my first earnings call as CEO, I\\'d like to tell you I\\'m excited about KC\\'s future. This a great time to have the opportunity to lead this great company and it\\'s a real honor. Our strategic priorities are to grow our portfolio of iconic brands, leverage our strong cost and financial discipline, and allocate capital on value-creating ways. We\\'re calling this KC Strategy 2022, and it\\'s how we intend to deliver balanced and sustainable growth, and create shareholder value in what we assume will be a continued challenging environment., Strategic Priorities, Grow Portfolio of Iconic Brands, Leverage Financial Discipline, Allocate\\nCapital, KC Strategy 2022, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, So, let me outline a few thoughts. First, we\\'ll continue to be lean on cost and be good stewards of shareholders\\' capital. Those will always be hallmarks of Kimberly Clark. Second, to drive top-line growth, we\\'ll sharpen and increase our focus on the consumer and better meet their needs than we\\'ve shown over the past few years., Lean on Cost, Good Stewards of Shareholders Capital, Consumer Focus, Top-Line Growth, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, To do that, we plan to develop and launch more meaningful innovation, increase investment in digital marketing, and improve in-store sales execution. While our commercial capabilities that drive the top line are good, I believe we can make them great. We\\'re launching internal initiatives in these areas to strengthen our capability. Just like we\\'ve made ongoing cost savings a superior capability., Innovation, Digital Marketing, In-Store Sales Execution, Commercial Capabilities, Ongoing Cost\\nSavings, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Now let me spend the next few minutes describing our growth priorities. We intend to grow our portfolio of iconic brands in line with or slightly ahead of our categories. We\\'re starting from a position of strength. We\\'ve built some of the world\\'s most well-known and trusted brands and we hold the No., Growth Priorities, Portfolio of Iconic Brands, Category, Strength, Well-Known Brands, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, 1 or 2 market share position in 80 countries. Our objective is to maintain or improve our overall market share position, especially in key categories. We have three main growth pillars and all of them are consumer-centered. The first is to elevate core businesses., Market Share Position, Key Categories, Growth Pillars, Consumer-Centered, Elevate Core Businesses, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Improving the product experience, making our products more valuable and worth more to consumers is what I mean by elevating core businesses. We\\'ll launch differentiated product innovation to drive growth in core markets. These innovations will be based on deep understanding of consumer insights, will deliver better performance, and will drive trade-up. You\\'ll see some examples of that end market in 2019, including in baby care., Elevating Core Businesses, Differentiated Product Innovation, Consumer Insights, Better\\nPerformance, Trade-Up, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Our upgraded and more standardized manufacturing footprint, enabled by our global restructuring, will help us bring our innovation pipeline to market more rapidly and more consistently around the world. Beyond innovation, we\\'ll core businesses by deploying category-expanding marketing, including in underpenetrated categories like adult incontinence and training pants. That\\'s how we\\'ve built large and leading brands like the [Inaudible] and Pull-Ups. Net revenue management will also help us grow core businesses with more process discipline and more consistent utilization of tools, we can generate more revenue through pricing strategies, promotion effectiveness, and product mix., Manufacturing Footprint, Innovation Pipeline, Core Businesses, Category-Expanding Marketing, Net\\nRevenue Management, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Our second growth pillar is to accelerate developing and emerging markets with an emphasis on personal care and KC professional. D&E is about 30% of company revenue. And while we had a lot of success in here, D&E remains our largest growth opportunity because of the relatively low levels of category penetration and frequency. We have the resources and plans to achieve success going forward., Personal Care, KC Professional, Developing and Emerging Markets, Accelerate Growth, D&E\\nOpportunity, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, For example, we\\'ll invest to drive category development in diapers. This is a $35 billion incremental market opportunity if the average spending per baby goes from today\\'s 15% of the U.S. level to one third of the U.S. level., Category Development, Diapers, Incremental Market Opportunity, Average Spending Per Baby, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll also invest in feminine care, adult care, and baby wipes, which all have significant penetration opportunities. Priority markets for us are in personal care are Latin America, China, Eastern Europe, and Asia. We\\'ll also focus on early stage markets such as India and Africa, which are relatively small today but has significant long-term potential. As in developed markets, we\\'ll deploy our consumer insight-based innovation model in D&E too., Personal Care, Feminine Care, Adult Care, Baby Wipes, Developing and Emerging Markets, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, As part of our restructuring, we\\'re moving more R&D resources into local markets to enable better and faster innovation. We\\'re using an adapt-and-deploy model for smaller markets. Beyond innovation, we\\'ll drive growth through stronger in-store sales execution, by optimizing distribution, pricing, shelving, and merchandising. We\\'ll also deploy category-building marketing campaigns and in-market activities to help develop these markets., Innovation, Restructuring, R&D Resources, In-Store Sales Execution, Distribution, Pricing, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, In KC Professional, only 20% of the business is in D&E. We have significant whitespace opportunity as industrialization and economic development continue. Our near-term focus markets will include Latin America and China. Our third growth pillar is to drive digital market in e-commerce., KC Professional, Digital Market, E-Commerce, Latin America, China, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Through digital, we can build one-to-one consumer relationships, which will enable us to maximize lifetime value for our consumers. We\\'ll invest even more in digital market and help us build those relationships. Today, digital is approximately half of our working media mix, and that percentage is growing. We\\'ll deploy data-driven and compelling marketing with precision targeting to engage with consumers at the right time with the right content., Digital Market, Consumer Relationships, Lifetime Value, Working Media Mix, Precision Targeting, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, We gain deep experience with this approach, including in China, South Korea, and the U.S., and plan to utilize it more globally to engage, acquire, and retain consumers. Data-driven digital marketing and dynamic content development is helping us improve consumer engagement loyalty and ROI. In addition, e-commerce is an important and growing part of our business. These channels grow in double digits and is about 10% of our overall revenue., China, South Korea, U.S., Data-Driven Digital Marketing, Dynamic Content Development, E-Commerce, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Our online shares in key countries are slightly ahead of or similar to our offline positions. Our products are well-positioned for this environment because they have high recognition and consumer trust and they\\'re also critical to help our customers grow since they\\'re important traffic drivers. We plan to leverage our capabilities and attractiveness of our brands to capture the opportunities that exist in e-commerce. Digital marketing and e-commerce also further enable our strategies to elevate core businesses and accelerate growth in D&E markets., Digital Marketing, E-Commerce, Consumer Trust, Offline Positions, Core Businesses, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, We have a strong portfolio of brands, the right strategies and organization structure, and a solid foundation to build on going forward. We also have significant opportunities to accelerate our capabilities that drive growth. We have pockets of excellence around the world and I expect us to drive more consistency globally, and achieve a step-change in capabilities overall. Our second strategic priority is to leverage our strong cost and financial discipline to fund growth and improve margins., Strong Portfolio, Strategies, Organization Structure, Significant Opportunities, Consistency\\nGlobal, Cost and Financial Discipline, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, We have a strong legacy in this area and that\\'s something that we expect to continue going forward. We\\'ll drive ongoing supply chain productivity through our FORCE program. FORCE has generated savings of $3.4 billion over the last decade and we expect significant savings for years to come. We\\'ll also continue to execute the 2018 restructuring program., Strong Legacy, Ongoing Supply Chain Productivity, FORCE Program, Savings, Restructuring Program, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, This is the biggest restructuring in our history and it\\'s making us leaner, stronger, and faster. We\\'ll rigorously control discretionary spending to help us sustain our top-tier SG&A cost structure and we\\'ll drive down working capital with benefits from global supply chain initiatives and our improved manufacturing footprint. Our last strategic priority is to allocate capital in value-creating ways and is very consistent with how we\\'ve operated historically. After we complete our restructuring, we\\'ll target annual capital spending of 4% to 5% of net sales, down from our current target of 4.5% to 5%., Restructuring, SG&A Cost Structure, Working Capital, Capital Allocation, Net Sales, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, We plan to continue providing shareholders a top-tier dividend. We\\'ll evaluate M&A opportunities in a disciplined manner with a bias for tuck-in transactions in existing categories. M&A is not expected to be a significant part of our growth strategy. Finally, we plan to allocate healthy amounts of cash flow to share repurchases., Dividend, M&A, Share Repurchases, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Now let me turn to our medium-term financial objectives that come with KC Strategy 2022. Our top-line objective is to grow sales and organic sales 1% to 3% annually. That assumes category growth in the range of 1% to 2%, similar to recent conditions. Macro headwinds in Latin America, birth rate declines in South Korean and the U.S., and price competition in China diapers have all impacted category growth in the last few years., Medium-term Financial Objectives, Top-line Objective, Organic Sales Growth, Category Growth, Macro\\nHeadwinds, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, We believe these factors are largely cyclical and we\\'ll focus on doing our part to drive these categories but we also believe it\\'s appropriate not to plan for much improvement right now. Depending on how our categories evolve and the success of our initiatives, we\\'ll work to achieve the upper half of that 1% to 3% target range. On the bottom line, our objective is to increase adjusted earnings per share mid-single digits annually. We expect to grow operating profit 3% to 5%., Cyclical Factors, Category Evolution, Initiatives, Adjusted Earnings Per Share Growth, Operating\\nProfit Growth, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, On average, that implies annual operating margin improvement of 30 to 40 basis points. Our strategy to increase gross margin somewhat faster and reinvest in advertising and marketing the fuel to top line. Ongoing share repurchases should also benefit EPS growth. In terms of capital efficiency, our objective is to at least maintain our top tier ROIC at its current level., Operating Margin Improvement, Gross Margin, Advertising and Marketing, Share Repurchases, Capital\\nEfficiency, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, Over the last 15 years, we\\'ve nearly doubled ROIC and it\\'s currently more than 26%. We\\'ll continue to be disciplined with our investment strategies but we won\\'t turn away value-creating opportunities with attractive returns that may be below our overall average. Lastly, we\\'re targeting to increase our dividend generally in line with our growth in adjusted earnings per share. Our payout ratio is in the low 60s and our yield is about 3.5%., ROIC, Investment Strategies, Dividend Growth, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Payout Ratio, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, We continue to believe that a strong dividend is an important part of our investment proposition. I believe these medium-term financial objectives are appropriate and realistic in the current environment. Longer term, we continue to have significant optimism about the potential of our categories in our business. Our categories are essential for consumers and have significant development opportunities., Dividend, Medium-term Financial Objectives, Category Potential, Optimism, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, We have very strong brands that we\\'re investing behind and we\\'re focused on raising our game on key growth capabilities. This morning I\\'ve outlined the key components of our medium term strategy. We look forward to sharing more information with you and updating you on our progress as the year progresses. Overall, we\\'re confident in our ability to create shareholder value through successful execution of our strategies., Medium-term Strategy, Key Growth Capabilities, Shareholder Value Creation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 4, Mike Hsu, Chief Executive Officer, That concludes our prepared remarks and now we\\'ll take your questions.\\xa0, Medium-term Strategy, Key Growth Capabilities, Shareholder Value Creation, Questions, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Paul Alexander, Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you, and good morning, everyone.

I\\'d like to be the first to congratulate Mike Hsu on his upcoming move to become Chief Executive Officer of Kimberly Clark. So, congratulations, Mike. The Board of Directors and I have been working on this succession plan for several years. It was my recommendation that Mike it he right choice and now is the right time. This is a carefully planned and natural transition.,  Succession Plan,  CEO Election,  Board of Directors,  Right Choice,  Natural\\nTransition, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Thomas J.

He\\'s passionate about our people, our brands, and our businesses, and he has a deep understanding of what it takes to win in the marketplace. Now let me hand the call over to Mike.,  Legacy,  Passion,  Understanding,  Winning in Marketplace,  Handing Over, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Good morning, everyone. First, I\\'d like to thank you, Tom, for your tremendous leadership of Kimberly Clark over the past 35 years, especially the last 16 years as CEO. During your tenure, you really transformed K-C into one of the world\\'s leading consumer products companies. You\\'ve also been a great mentor to me, and I\\'m honored to lead this great company, and I\\'m excited about our future.,  Leadership,  Transformation,  Mentorship,  Future,  Thank You, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, So now, back to the business at hand. I\\'m going to turn the call over to Maria to talk about the third quarter results.,  Third Quarter Results,  Business,  Turnover,  Maria,  Q&A, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Congratulations, both Tom and Mike. Tom, your great leadership and mentorship since I joined in 2015, and Mike, looking forward to the future. As awkward as it is, I\\'m going to pivot to the headlines for the quarter. So let\\'s get into it.,  Leadership,  Mentorship,  Pivot,  Headlines,  Future, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Organic sales were up 1%, driven by 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. Margins and operating profit were impacted by significant commodity inflation and negative foreign currency effects. Hoping to partially offset those headwinds, we delivered strong cost savings and reduced overhead spending. And with the benefit of lower taxes, our adjusted earnings per share increased 7%. Finally, we continue to return cash to shareholders.,  Organic Sales,  Commodity Inflation,  Foreign Currency Effects,  Cost Savings, \\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Now let\\'s look at the details of the results, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That\\'s down 2% year-on-year, with a 3-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales increased 1% versus a year ago. Net selling prices and product mix each improved 1%, while volumes fell 1 point.,  Sales,  Currency Rates,  Organic Sales,  Net Selling Prices,  Product Mix, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Moving on to profitability. Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 33.2%, down 250 basis points year-on-year. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.4%, down 120 basis points. Commodities were a drag of $210 million in the quarter, primarily due to pulp and other raw materials. We\\'re now expected that full-year commodity inflation will be in the upper half of our previous estimate of $675 to $775 million.,  Adjusted Gross Margin,  Adjusted Operating Margin,  Commodity Inflation,  Raw\\nMaterials,  Full-Year Estimate, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Foreign currencies were also a sizable headwind in the quarter, reducing operating profit by high single-digit rates. On the other hand, we achieved $105 million of forced cost savings, including significant benefits from negotiated short-term raw materials contracts. We also delivered $40 million of cost savings from our restructuring program. In terms of that program, we\\'re making good progress overall, including closing a small consumer tissue converting facility in Latin America this quarter.,  Foreign Currencies,  Operating Profit,  Cost Savings,  Restructuring Program, \\nConsumer Tissue Converting Facility, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, In addition to the restructuring, we also continued to reduce our overhead costs. In total, between-the-lines spending declined 150 basis points as a percentage of net sales. All in all, adjusted operating profit was down 8%. On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.71, up 7% year-over-year. That includes significant benefits from a lower tax rate, along with lower interest and share count. We now expect the full-year tax rate will between 21% to 22%, which is better than our estimate of 23% from three months ago, largely because of some planning initiatives., Cost reduction, overhead costs, adjusted operating profit, earnings per share, tax rate, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, I\\'m pleased that our effective tax rate is expected to be below target this year. Looking ahead at this point, I expect our rate in 2019 will move back up somewhere into the 23% to 26% range that we initially targeted for 2018. Therefore, we\\'re expecting that the tax rate will be a pretty significant year-on-year earnings headwind for us in 2019., Cost reduction, overhead costs, adjusted operating profit, earnings per share, tax rate, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Now let\\'s turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $662 million, compared to $805 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease increased a $100 million U.S. pension plan contribution, restructuring payments, and the benefit of lower taxes. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $520 million in the third quarter. We expect the full-year amount will total $2.2 billion, in line with our $2.1 to $2.3 billion target., Cash flow, capital efficiency, dividends, share repurchases, pension plan contribution, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Looking at our segments. In personal care, organic sales were up 2%. Performance was led by developing and emerging markets, with organic sales up 5%. In terms of the highlights for D&E personal care this quarter, in Brazil, organic sales were up high teens, including inflationary-driven price increases, and solid volume growth on diapers. In Argentina, organic sales were also up high teens, as price realization continues to accelerate, while our volumes, both for us and for the category, were down.,  personal care,  organic sales,  developing and emerging markets,  D&E personal care,\\n Brazil, Argentina, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, with strong volume growth on Huggies and Kotex. In China, organic sales were down high teens, due to lower diaper sales and continued challenging market conditions. Elsewhere in Asia, ASEAN, which represents about 3% of Kimberly Clark sales across all of our business segments, ASEAN had strong double-digit organic sales growth in personal care, driven by Huggies in Vietnam.,  Eastern Europe,  organic sales,  China,  ASEAN,  Huggies, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Personal care organic sales were up 2% in North America. Infant and child care volumes increased high single-digits compared to a mid-single-digit decline last year. Pull-Ups training pants momentum remained strong, and Huggies diapers benefited from growth in e-commerce and the timing of promotional shipments.,  personal care,  organic sales,  North America,  infant and child care,  Pull-Ups\\ntraining pants, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Adult care volumes were down mid-single-digits, reflecting strong growth last year, changes in promotional timing, and competitive activity. Overall, personal care segment operating margins continue to be healthy at 20.7%, although down 40 basis points year-on-year.,  adult care,  volumes,  promotional timing,  competitive activity,  operating\\nmargins, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Switching to the consumer tissue segment. Organic sales fell 2%. North America organic sales declined 5%, primarily due to lower promotional activity. Overall, our initiatives to improve net realized revenue led to a 2% increase in net selling prices, and a 1% improvement in mix. Developed markets outside of North America grew consumer tissue organic sales by 4%, led by Western and Central Europe. Consumer tissue segment operating margins were 14.4%. That\\'s down 310 basis points, driven by commodity inflation and lower volumes, partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings.,  consumer tissue,  organic sales,  North America,  developed markets,  operating\\nmargins, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Lastly, in our Kimberly Clark professional segment, organic sales grew 1%. In D&E markets, K-C professional organic sales rose 4%, driven by continued volume growth in Asia-Pacific. Organic sales were up slightly in North America, including volume growth in washroom products and wipers. K-C professional segment operating margins were 18.9%. That\\'s down 160 basis points versus record performance last year. Results this year were impacted by commodity and currency headwinds.,  Kimberly Clark professional,  organic sales,  D&E markets,  North America, \\noperating margins, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, In summary, our third quarter results were impacted by a difficult environment, with depreciating currencies adding to continued significant commodity inflation. Nonetheless, we achieved higher net selling prices, delivered significant cost savings, and reduced overhead spending. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. With that, I\\'ll turn it back over to Mike to comment on our full-year outlook.,  difficult environment,  commodity inflation,  net selling prices,  cost savings, \\noverhead spending, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Thanks, Maria. As most of you know, the overall environment remains challenging, especially with commodity inflation and currency volatility. In the near-term, we\\'re responding by aggressively managing our business up and down the P&L. At the same time, we continue to execute our long-term strategy to deliver sustainable growth. As we mentioned in this morning\\'s new release, we are confirming our previous outlook for our key top and bottom line financial target. On the top line, we continue to target organic sales growth of approximately 1%. That\\'s equal to our actual performance through 9 months.,  challenging environment,  commodity inflation,  currency volatility,  long-term\\nstrategy,  financial target, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, I\\'m encouraged that we\\'re making progress improving net selling prices. Pricing went from being down 1% in the first half to up 1% in the third quarter. That\\'s consistent with what we said in July, when we indicated that pricing should be modestly positive in the back half of the year. In mid-August, we announced price increases on the majority of our consumer businesses in North America. Many of those increases will start to go into effect in the first quarter of 2019. Realizing higher selling prices will be important next year, given that recent commodity forecasts and foreign currency rates imply pretty significant headwinds again in 2019.,  net selling prices,  pricing,  back half of the year,  price increases,  commodity\\nforecasts, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, Now looking at commodities and currencies for 2018, we expect these factors will negatively impact our adjusted operating profit by slightly more than the 20% to 25% range we assumed in July. That\\'s mostly because of the recent weakness in many foreign currencies, especially in Latin America. In addition, our commodity inflation outlook is a bit higher on average. And so as a result, our teams are further reducing costs and raising selling prices. In addition, as Maria mentioned, our outlook for this year\\'s tax rate has improved.,  commodities,  currencies,  operating profit,  foreign currencies,  cost reduction, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D. Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer, All in all, we continue to target bottom line adjusted earnings per share of $6.60 to $6.80 for the year, up 6% to 9% year-on-year. So let me wrap up with the following. First, I\\'m extremely proud of the 40,000 K-C employees around the world who are committed to our vision to lead the world in essentials for a better life. We have a strong senior leadership team in place to help lead this company forward.,  bottom line adjusted earnings per share,  year-on-year,  senior leadership team, \\nvision,  employees, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 3, Michael D.

Third, our teams are focused on improving our business, winning in the marketplace, and creating long-term shareholder value. So that concludes our prepared remarks, and now we\\'ll be happy to take your questions.,  long-term opportunities,  growth,  teams,  business improvement,  shareholder\\nvalue, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Paul Alexander, Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s second quarter earnings conference call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO, Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here\\'s the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of second-quarter results. After that, Mike will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I\\'ll start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were even year-on-year as growth in international markets was offset by lower sales in North America. Margins and operating profit were impacted by significant commodity inflation. Helping to offset those headwinds, we delivered strong cost savings and reduced overhead spending, and our adjusted earnings per share were up 7%. And finally, we\\'re on track with our restructuring program. Moving on to the details of our results, starting with sales, our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That\\'s up 1% year-on-year with a one point benefit from currency rates. Organic sales were even with the year-ago. Mix improved by 1% while volumes fell less than 1% and net selling prices were down slightly. On profitability, second quarter adjusted gross margin was 33.4% down 270 basis points year-on-year.,  organic sales,  margins,  operating profit,  cost savings,  restructuring program, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Maria Henry, Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 16.8%, down 100 basis points. Commodities were a drag of $200 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher pulp costs and secondarily, inflation in other raw materials. We\\'re now expecting that full-year commodity cost inflation will be between $675 and $775 million. On average, that\\'s $250 million more than we assumed in April and $375 million more than what we planned in our original plan in January. While commodities are higher than expected, our teams continue to do a great job delivering cost savings and tightly managing overhead and discretionary spending. We achieved $110 million of forced cost savings in the quarter, and we\\'re now targeting $425 to $450 million of savings for the year. That\\'s $25 to $50 million higher than our original target including more value from negotiated raw material contracts. In addition, we delivered $40 million of cost savings from our restructuring program.,  commodity cost inflation,  cost savings,  forced cost savings,  restructuring program,\\n raw material contracts, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Maria Henry, Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, We\\'re accelerating actions where feasible, and we now expect full-year savings between $100 and $120 million. That\\'s $50 million higher than our original target. In addition to the restructuring, we continued to reduce overhead costs. In total, between the line spending declined by 180 basis points as a percent of net sales. All in all, adjusted operating profit was down 5%. On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.59, up 7% year-on-year. That included about seven points of earnings growth from a lower tax rate along with benefits from lower interest expense and share accounts. We expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be at the low-end of our 23% to 26% target range. Let\\'s turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $787 million compared to $825 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease was in line with our expectations, and it includes cash restructuring payments and the benefit of lower taxes.,  full-year savings,  restructuring program,  overhead costs,  adjusted operating\\nprofit,  adjusted effective tax rate, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Maria Henry, Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $575 million in the second quarter, and we continue to expect the full-year amount will total $2.1 to $2.3 billion. Looking at our segment results in personal care, organic sales were down 1%. Net selling prices declined 2% while product mix improved one point. Overall personal care operating margins remain healthy at 20.4%, although down 50 basis points year-on-year. In consumer tissue, organic sales fell 1%. Volumes decreased 3% while net selling prices increased about 2%, and product mix improved slightly. Consumer tissue operating margins of 14.1% were down 260 basis points. Significantly higher pulp costs and lower volumes were partially offset by cost savings, lower overhead spending, as well as favorable selling prices and product mix. In our K-C Professional business, organic sales grew 2% with gains in all major geographies.,  personal care,  consumer tissue,  K-C Professional,  pulp costs,  selling prices, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Maria Henry, Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Volumes in product mix, each increased 1%. K-C Professional operating margins of 19.2% were down 80 basis points compared to a strong year-ago quarter. Results were impacted by commodity inflation, partially offset by cost savings and benefits from topline growth. In summary, our second quarter results were impacted by a difficult environment, particularly with significant commodity inflation. Nonetheless, we\\'re achieving strong cost savings. We\\'re making good early progress with our restructuring program. And we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. With that, I\\'ll turn the call over to Mike.,  commodity inflation,  cost savings,  restructuring program,  capital allocation, \\ntopline growth, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Today, I\\'m gonna focus my comments on organic sales, pricing, and our full-year outlook. As Maria just mentioned, organic sales were even in the quarter. That said, organic sales were up 1% year-to-date which is right in line with our full-year target. Let me spend a few minutes on our three main growth priorities for 2018. Our first priority is to strengthen and grow our core businesses. In North American consumer products, following a strong first quarter, organic sales were down 2% in the second quarter. Halfway through the year, which is a better indicator in our performance because of some changes in our promotional shipments, volume is up 2%, and organic sales were even year-on-year. Our year-to-date market shares were up or even year-on-year in five of eight product categories. We\\'ve launched a number of innovations and are supporting our brands with strong marketing and promotion programs.,  organic sales,  pricing,  full-year outlook,  growth priorities,  North American\\nconsumer products, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Overall, these initiatives are on track with our expectations. In our K-C Professional business, second quarter organic sales were up 2% in North America with volume growth in all major product categories. K-C Professional organic sales increased 3% in developing and emerging markets, led by Asia Pacific. In developed markets outside North America, organic sales rose 1%. In South Korea, while our diaper business continues to be impacted by a lower birth rate, our other brands are growing nicely. Now let me turn to our second key priority which is to accelerate personal care growth in developing and emerging markets. Second quarter organic sales for these businesses were even year-on-year. In China, organic sales were down about 10%. Competitive promotion activity in the diaper market has increased, and we are responding appropriately. During the second quarter, we launched our upgraded Huggies premium diaper.,  K-C Professional,  organic sales,  developing and emerging markets,  personal care,\\n China, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, And this quarter, we\\'re rolling out an improved premium diaper pant. We continue to be optimistic about these innovation, although, in the near-term, we do expect marketing conditions will remain challenging. In Brazil, organic sales were up mid-single digits compared to a high-single-digit decline in the base period. Volumes were up slightly despite a modest impact from the countrywide transportation strike. Pricing has now turned positive following the increases we\\'ve implemented this year. In Argentina, organic sales were up mid-single digits. Price realization continues to be positive while volumes for us in the category are down which reflects the typical economic conditions. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased double-digits for the third consecutive quarter. Volumes rose double-digits on both Huggies and Kotex behind innovations, strong marketing programs, and continued expansion outside of Russia. In terms of our market positions, trends are positive in most of these key markets.,  premium diaper pant,  innovation,  Brazil,  Argentina,  Eastern Europe, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Shares are up in Brazil, Argentina, and Eastern Europe, but down in China diapers. Regarding our third growth priority which is to further build digital e-commerce capabilities, we continue to make good progress. Our digital marketing programs, joint customer business plans, and investments in tools are producing good results. Online sales continue to grow at healthy double-digit rates so far this year. Now let me switch to the topic of selling prices. In April, I outlined several of our actions to improve net realized revenue. That included sheet count reductions in North American bath tissue, price increases in Latin America and other international markets, and initiatives globally in K-C Professional. These actions are broadly on track, and our pricing trends are improving. Net selling prices have gone from being down 2% in the fourth quarter last year to down 1% in the first quarter this year and down about half a point in the second quarter.,  digital e-commerce capabilities,  selling prices,  net realized revenue,  sheet count\\nreductions,  price increases, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, We expect overall pricing on the second half to turn moderately positive, mostly because of the actions we\\'ve taken in the first six months of the year. We will also be lapping elevated promotion activity in North America, especially in the fourth quarter. Still, given the headwinds we\\'ve faced, it\\'s clear that we need more pricing. As a result, our businesses around the world, including North America are closely evaluating further opportunities to increase net selling prices. We anticipate that nearly all the impact from any potential actions would start to show up in our results next year. Now let me turn to our outlook. Clearly, the near-term environment has become more challenging, and we are responding by aggressively reducing costs and increasing selling prices. At the same time, we continue to execute our long-term strategies to deliver balanced and profitable growth. We continue to innovate, support our brands with category-building marketing campaigns, pursue targeted growth initiatives, and improve key capabilities.,  pricing,  net selling prices,  cost reduction,  long-term strategies,  innovation, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, We also continue to focus on sustainable cost reductions while we implement our global restructuring to make our company even stronger for the long haul. In terms of our specific targets for the year, on the top line, we continue to target organic sales growth of approximately 1%. On the other hand, the outlook on foreign currency has gotten considerably worse since April. We now expect currencies will have a neutral to 1% negative impact on our net sales. Three months ago, we expected a 1% to 2% positive impact. On the bottom line, we\\'re now targeting full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $660 to $680. Our previous outlook was $690 to $720. To put that reduction in perspective, we\\'re now expecting that commodities and currencies will be a combined year-on-year operating profit headwind of about 20% to 25%. Our original plan for the year included a net drag in the high-single digits to low-double digit range.,  sustainable cost reductions,  global restructuring,  organic sales growth,  foreign\\ncurrency impact,  adjusted earnings per share, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 2, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, We expect to offset approximately half the additional headwinds with more benefits from pricing, cost savings, and spending reductions. In summary, we are aggressively managing our business to benefit near-term results in a challenging environment. At the same time, we\\'re executing our long-term strategies to create sustainable shareholder value. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we\\'ll begin to take your questions.,  pricing,  cost savings,  spending reductions,  long-term strategies,  shareholder\\nvalue, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Paul Alexander, Vice President, Investor Relations, Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\\'s first quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO, Mike Hsu, Chief Operating Officer, and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here\\'s the agenda for the call. Maria will start with a review of first quarter results and provide a brief update on our global restructuring program. After that, Mike will share his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the year. We\\'ll finish with Q&A with Tom, Mike, and Maria. We have a presentation of today\\'s materials in the Investors section of our website.,  first quarter earnings conference call,  global restructuring program,  results, \\noutlook,  Q&A, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Paul Alexander, Vice President, Investor Relations, As a reminder, we\\'ll be making forward looking statements today. Please see Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward looking statements. Finally, we\\'ll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both which exclude certain items described in this morning\\'s news release. The release has information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I\\'ll turn it over to Maria.,  forward looking statements,  Risk Factors section,  adjusted results,  outlook, \\nreconciliations, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Maria Henry, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. We returned to delivering organic sales growth with a solid increase of 2%. Margins were impacted by significant commodity inflation. Helping to offset that, we delivered strong cost savings and reduced overhead spending. And our adjusted earnings per share increased 9%. And finally, we\\'re on track with our restructuring program and our overall capital plan. Now let\\'s look at the details of our results. Let\\'s start with sales. Our first quarter net sales were $4.7 billion. That\\'s up 5% year-on-year with a three point benefit from currency ratees. Organic sales grew 2% in the quarter led by improved performance in North America. Mike\\'s going to provide some more color on our top-line in just a few minutes. Moving on to profitability, our first quarter adjusted growth margins was 33.8%, down 310 basis points year-on-year.,  organic sales growth,  commodity inflation,  cost savings,  adjusted earnings per\\nshare,  restructuring program, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Maria Henry, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Commodities were a drag of $175 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher pulp costs and secondarily, inflation and other raw materials. We\\'re now expecting that full-year cost inflation will be between $400 and $550 million. That\\'s $100 to $150 million more than we assumed in January. Meanwhile, our FORCE cost savings program continues to deliver strong results. First quarter savings were $90 million. Moving down to P&L, adjusted operating margin was 17.4%, down 140 basis points. Between-the-lines spending fell 140 basis points as a percent of net sales as we continue to tightly manage overhead and discretionary spending throughout our company. In a few minutes, Mike will talk about what we\\'re doing to improve margins from the first quarter level. All in all, adjusted operating profit was down 3%. In addition to the factors that I just mentioned, results benefited from volume growth and $20 million of favorable currency translation effect but were also impacted by lower net selling prices.,  commodity costs,  cost inflation,  FORCE program,  operating margin,  overhead\\nspending, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Maria Henry, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, On the bottom-line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.71, up 9% year-on-year. That included about seven points of earnings growth from a lower tax rate along with benefits from lower interest expense and share count. Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency, cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $542 million compared to $436 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was in line with our expectations and riven by lower tax payment. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. Dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $550 million in the first quarter, and we expect the full-year amount will total $2.1 to $2.3 billion. Looking at our results by segment, in personal care, organic sales were even year-on-year. Volumes and product mix each improved 1%, offset by lower net selling prices. Overall personal care operating margins remain healthy at 20.4%, although down 120 basis points, including impacts from commodity inflation and lower selling prices.,  earnings per share,  tax rate,  interest expense,  cash flow,  capital efficiency, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Maria Henry, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In consumer tissue, organic sales rose 5%. Volumes increased 7% while product mix was down two points. Consumer tissue operating margins of 15.8% were down 340 basis points. Significantly higher pulp costs were partially offset by top-line growth, cost savings, and lower between-the-line spending. In our K-C Professional business, organic sales grew 2%. Volumes increased approximately 2%. And price and mix were both also slightly positive. K-C Professional operating margins were 19%. That\\'s up 10 basis points as our team continues to manage well in this environment. Now let me share a brief update on our 2018 global restructuring program. Initial implementation steps are under way, and we\\'re on track with our plan. In terms of our administrative and overhead organization, in North America, we offered a voluntary severance plan to most of our salaried employees in the first quarter. And that plan is now closed.,  consumer tissue,  K-C Professional,  global restructuring program,  administrative and\\noverhead organization,  North America, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Maria Henry, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Soon, we will begin to share more specifics with our workforce, primarily in North America about our redesigned organization and the resulting implications. We\\'ve also announced our intention to move our European shared service center from the UK to Poland in order to reduce our labor costs. In terms of manufacturing facility, we\\'ve announced our intention to close our consumer tissue facility in California and our plan to close our nonwovens facility in Wisconsin. We continue to expect $50 to $70 million of restructuring savings in 2018 with the vast majority of these savings occurring in the second half of the year as our workforce reductions ramp up. With that, I\\'ll now turn the call over to Mike.,  redesigned organization,  European shared service center,  manufacturing facility, \\nrestructuring savings,  workforce reductions, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director, Thanks, Maria. Good morning. I\\'m gonna focus my comments this morning on organic sales and our full year earnings outlook. As Maria just mentioned, organic sales grew 2% in the quarter which is a good start to the year. Performance included benefits from targeted growth initiatives, innovations launched over the past 12 months, and increased investments in our brands. On our conference call in January, I talked about our three main growth priorities for the year. Let me now spend a few minutes on each. Our first priority is to strengthen and grow our core businesses. In North American consumer products, organic sales increased 3% in the first quarter behind volume growth of 6%. Market shares were up or even year-on-year in five of eight product categories and up or even sequentially compared to the prior quarter in every category. In personal care in North America, volumes increased 3%. Net selling prices were down 2%, reflecting increased investment levels that helped our volume performance.,  organic sales,  full-year earnings outlook,  growth initiatives,  innovations, \\ncore businesses, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director, In terms of innovation, in the first half we\\'re launching product improvements on Pull-Ups training pants, Premium Huggies diapers, Huggies baby wipes, Poise pads, and Depend underwear. In consumer tissue in North America, volumes rose 9% compared to a decline of 7% in the year-ago period. Results benefited from increased promotion support, a severe cold and flu season, and promotion time and differences compared to last year. Product mix was down three points because of the promotion activity. Now in terms of product news, we\\'re introducing new Kleenex wet wipes and bringing major bath tissue improvements to Cottonelle and part of our Scott lineup. The bath tissue upgrades are shipping now and come with sheet count reductions. This will improve net realized revenue high-single digits on nearly $1 billion in annual sales. In our K-C Professional business, volumes were up 2% in North America with growth in all product categories led by wipers.,  innovation,  product improvements,  volume growth,  promotion support,  product\\nnews, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director, K-C Professional volumes increased 4% in developing and emerging markets led by Asia-Pacific. In our developed markets outside North America, organic sales rose 2%. In South Korea, our diaper business continues to be impacted by a lower birthrate. However, this was offset by strong results in our other consumer businesses there. Now let me turn to our second priority which is to accelerate personal care growth in developing and emerging markets. First quarter organic sales for these businesses were even year-on-year. Looking at some of our key markets, in Brazil, organic sales were up mid-single digits driven by broad base volume growth. Market shares were up nearly three points in diapers and two points in feminine care. Elsewhere in Latin America, organic sales were down low-single digits. That included lower volumes in Argentina, Chile, and Columbia. That said, our market positions are holding up well, including in Argentina where Huggies share is up one point.,  K-C Professional,  developing and emerging markets,  organic sales,  personal care\\ngrowth,  key markets, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director, We expect our sales to pick up in Latin America. We have a number of product innovations launching throughout the reason. And we are implementing selling price increases to help offset inflation. In China, organic sales were down mid-single digits. A strong growth in feminine care was more than offset by lower sales in diapers. We have just started to introduce a significantly upgraded Huggies premium diaper. And we have more innovation coming later in the year. We expect these innovations will improve our volume trends in the coming quarters. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased mid-teens. Our momentum continues to be strong in this part of the world with another quarter of double-digit volume growth and share gains on Huggies and Kotex. Regarding our third growth priority which is to further build digital and e-commerce capability, we continue to make good progress.,  product innovations,  selling price increases,  Latin America,  China,  Eastern\\nEurope, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director, Our targeted digital marketing programs, investments in tools to improve capabilities, and customer joint business plans are producing strong results. That was especially true this quarter in North America. So, to summarize our top-line, I\\'m encouraged with our start to the year. We know we have more work to do because we continue to operate in a competitive environment. That said, our first quarter results and our plans going forward give me further confidence in our 1% organic growth target for the year. Now let me turn to our earnings outlook. We continue to target full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 690 to 720. That\\'s year-on-year growth of 11% to 16%. Our teams are taking actions to improve net realized revenue and reduce costs to offset the commodity headwind we\\'re facing. We expect these actions will help improve our margins from first quarter levels, especially in the second half of the year. On the revenue front, we\\'re taking steps in several areas of our business.,  digital marketing programs,  investments,  customer joint business plans,  earnings\\noutlook,  commodity headwind, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director, These actions include the sheet count reductions in North America and the price increases in Latin America that I just mentioned. In addition, our consumer businesses in other international markets will be raising prices, and our K-C Professional team has begun to do the same in most regions. While many of these initiatives were included in our original plan for the year, our overall expectation for selling price increases has improved slightly from three months ago. In terms of our focus on cost, FORCE savings should build from first quarter levels. In addition, as Maria noted, restructuring savings will occur mostly in the back half of the year, and our teams are moving with urgency to accelerate actions. We\\'re also redoubling our efforts to reduce discretionary spending.,  selling price increases,  cost reduction,  FORCE savings,  restructuring savings, \\ndiscretionary spending, Kimberly-Clark\\nKMB, 2018, 1, Michael Hsu, President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director, In total, we expect these actions combined with our volume growth initiatives, a slightly better currency outlook, and some flexibility that we built into our original 2018 plan will enable us to deliver our earnings guidance for the year. So, to summarize, we\\'re off to a good start to the year on the top-line and with our market positions. We\\'re taking steps to improve our profitability, and we are broadly on track with our 2018 plan. Overall, we remain very optimistic about our opportunities to create long-term shareholder value through successful execution of our strategies. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and we\\'ll begin to take your questions.,  earnings guidance,  volume growth initiatives,  currency outlook,  market positions,\\n long-term shareholder value, Kimberly-Clark\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal \\'24 earnings call. Let\\'s start with what we want you to take away from our presentation shown here on Slide 5. At an industrywide level, macro dynamics have clearly impacted consumer behavior across the board., Consumer behavior,\\nMacro dynamics, Industry-wide impact, Earnings call, Slide 5, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, I will cover this in more detail shortly. But ultimately, this behavior shift has elongated the volume recovery period across the industry, which is reflected in our Q1 top-line results. As we\\'ve navigated these macro dynamics, I\\'m proud of the team for delivering another quarter of strong margin improvement and EPS growth. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our leverage ratio during the quarter while investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders., Earnings call,\\nMargin improvement, EPS growth, Balance sheet, Shareholder returns, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Our team\\'s execution supported a strong supply chain recovery during the quarter, hitting pre-pandemic service levels as we exited Q1. Looking toward the remainder of the year, we will work to drive volumes and top-line growth through targeted and disciplined investments behind prudent merchandising and continued support for our strong innovation. Finally, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal \\'24, reflecting confidence in our plans, people, and agility as we navigate a shifting consumer environment. As I mentioned a moment ago, the timetable for volume recovery has been elongated across the industry due to near-term consumer behavior changes., Supply chain\\nrecovery, Volume growth, Merchandising, Innovation, Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, After three years of unprecedented inflation, along with other macro dynamics, consumers have felt increased financial pressure and used a variety of strategies to stretch their balance sheets. This resulted in a near-term reprioritization of their typical purchase behaviors in order to make their budgets work. We\\'ve seen shifts like this before and expect these near-term changes in behavior to also be temporary. In fact, recent trends suggest this is already underway., Inflation, Macro\\ndynamics, Consumer behavior, Budgeting, Temporary changes, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Let me provide a bit more color on the kinds of behavioral shifts we\\'ve observed. As you\\'ve seen for some time now, with the notable exception of summer travel, discretionary purchases have been down almost across the board. Consumers have also been actively reducing remnant household inventory from the pandemic. Within food, convenience-oriented items, typically a top consumer priority, have lagged as shoppers have turned to more hands-on food prep to get additional bang for their buck., Consumer behavior,\\nDiscretionary purchases, Household inventory, Food, Convenience items, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, And as they\\'ve done this, not surprisingly, they have shifted from meals per one to meals per many, even if not everyone is home at the same time to eat together. And the last shift I will mention is a reduction in wasted food and an increase in the use of leftovers. Collectively, these short-term behavior shifts act as a sort of cheat code to help these consumers spend within their means. Slide 8 demonstrates the elongated volume recovery across the industry., Consumer behavior,\\nMeals per day, Wasted food, Leftovers, Volume recovery, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, As you can see, through the four-week period ending August 26, the entire peer group was showing volume performance within a very tight band with Conagra in the middle of the pack. As I mentioned a minute ago, more recent trends are showing the first signs of improved performance. With that backdrop, let\\'s dive into our results shown on Slide 9. As you can see, in the quarter, we delivered organic net sales of approximately 2.9 billion, which is down slightly compared to last year as a result of the slower volume recovery we discussed., Volume performance,\\nPeer group comparison, Sales growth, Quarterly results, Consumer behavior, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Adjusted gross margin of 27.6% was up 272 basis points from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 16.7% was up 297 basis points compared to last year. And adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 increased almost 16% versus last year. Diving further into our top-line performance by retail domain, you can see on Slide 10 that sales in our staples domain were flat compared to the prior year., Gross margin,\\nOperating margin, Earnings per share, Top-line performance, Retail domain, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, As consumers shift toward more stretchable meals, our staples categories, such as canned chili and canned tomato, are well positioned and have gained unit share compared to last year. Despite the macro headwinds, our snacks domain has continued to grow as shown on Slide 11. We\\'re building unit share as consumers continue to respond positively to our microwave popcorn and ready-to-eat pudding and gel brands. Looking at Slide 12, you can see that our frozen domain has been the most significantly impacted by recent shifts in consumer behavior, particularly in areas like single-serve meals, given the headwinds we discussed a moment ago., Staples categories,\\nSnacks domain, Frozen domain, Consumer behavior, Macro headwinds, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, As we look at the frozen domain, it\\'s worth noting a few key points. First, despite the recent impact on volume, we continue to gain unit share in important frozen categories like single-serve meals. This dynamic demonstrates the relative strength and strong position of our brands. Second, the year-over-year performance figures do not properly represent the broader trend within frozen food., Frozen domain, Unit\\nshare, Brand strength, Year-over-year performance, Trend, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, In fact, if you look over a four-year period, Conagra\\'s frozen retail sales have increased 22%. Frozen meals has been one of the fastest-growing categories in in-home consumption over the past 40 years. Its 4% CAGR is in the top tier of foods growing in at-home consumption. This expansion has been fueled by the long-term sustained consumer demand for convenience, as well as the addition of innovation and quality ingredients., Frozen retail sales,\\nGrowth rate, Consumer demand, Innovation, Quality ingredients, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, This 40-year trend demonstrates the critical role that frozen plays in providing convenient, high-quality foods for every occasion which consumers have come to increasingly rely on. This is central to why we believe the current softness is temporary. Turning to Slide 14, I\\'m pleased to share that we continue to advance our supply chain initiatives during the quarter, allowing us to return our service performance back to pre-pandemic levels. Our productivity initiatives remain on track, and we plan to maintain and capitalize on this strong recovery during the rest of fiscal \\'24., Frozen food,\\nConsumer reliance, Supply chain initiatives, Productivity initiatives, Recovery, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, As a key piece of our action plan for the remainder of the year as outlined on Slide 15, in addition to our ongoing supply chain execution, we will continue to focus on executing our Conagra Way playbook as we make targeted and disciplined investments behind our brands and help protect share and drive the top line, while focused on investing behind quality, high ROI merchandising and A&P to support our brand. We\\'ll also continue to prioritize reducing our debt and improving our net leverage ratio. We are reaffirming our fiscal \\'24 guidance that we shared last quarter, including organic net sales growth of approximately 1% compared to fiscal \\'23, adjusted operating margin of 16% to 16.5%, and adjusted EPS between $2.70 to $2.75. Overall, we remain confident in our plans, people, and agility as we continue to navigate this shifting consumer environment., Conagra Way, Investments, Debt\\nreduction, Fiscal \\'24 guidance, Consumer environment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, With that, I\\'ll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials in more detail., Financials, Detail, Guidance,\\nConsumer environment, Agility, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Slide 18 highlights our results from the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our profit and cash flow delivery and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance targets. In Q1, net sales were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 0.3% decrease in organic net sales, driven primarily from the elongated recovery of volumes due to the industrywide slowdown in consumption that Sean discussed earlier., Profit, Cash flow, Guidance, Volume,\\nIndustry trends, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Gross margin recovery was a key priority for us in fiscal \\'23, and we delivered another strong result in Q1. Adjusted gross profit increased by 10.9% in the quarter, primarily from the pricing implemented in the prior year and strong productivity, which more than offset the negative impacts of cost of goods sold inflation and unfavorable operating leverage. Adjusted gross margin increased 272 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA increased 12.1%, largely driven by the increase in adjusted gross profit. Slide 19 provides a breakdown of our net sales., Gross margin, Pricing, Productivity,\\nCost of goods sold inflation, Adjusted EBITDA, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The 0.3% decrease in organic net sales was driven by a 6.6% decrease in volume which was partially offset by a 6.3% improvement in price mix, a result of fiscal \\'23\\'s inflation-driven pricing actions. A small benefit from the impact of foreign exchange contributed to reported net sales coming in flat for the quarter. Slide 20 shows the top-line performance for each segment in Q1. Our grocery and snacks segment achieved net sales growth of 1.2% in the quarter., Volume, Price mix, Foreign exchange,\\nSegment performance, Top-line growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We gained dollar share in snacking categories, including seeds and microwave popcorn, as well as in staples categories, including chili and canned meat. As Sean discussed earlier, our refrigerated and frozen segment was the most impacted by recent consumer behavior shifts, with net sales down 4.6% in the quarter. Our international and foodservice segments combined are slightly below 20% of our net sales. Both are important to Conagra and contributed meaningfully to growth this quarter., Gained dollar share, Snacking\\ncategories, Staples categories, Refrigerated and frozen segment, International and foodservice\\nsegments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Our international segment delivered year-over-year volume growth in addition to improved price mix, which helped support strong organic net sales growth of 8.2% during the quarter. Our two largest international regions, Mexico and Canada, delivered double-digit organic net sales growth over prior year. We also saw low single-digit volume growth in Mexico, which contributed to the segment\\'s overall positive volumes. For the remainder of the year, we expect volume growth to continue in international., Volume growth, Price mix,\\nInternational segment, Mexico, Canada, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Our foodservice segment delivered 5.2% net sales growth in Q1 from strong price mix, and we expect to see positive net sales growth in foodservice for the fiscal year. Foodservice also delivered a strong gross margin in Q1 versus a year ago due to the reduction of supply chain disruption costs incurred in the prior year. This benefit is not expected to extend beyond Q1. Our foodservice segment supplies a diverse set of clients beyond restaurants, including healthcare, travel and leisure, and educational institutions, and we are well positioned to compete in these markets., Foodservice segment growth, Price\\nmix, Gross margin, Supply chain disruption costs, Client diversity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 21 highlights our adjusted operating margin bridge. We are pleased to have delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of strong gross margin improvement, up 272 basis points in Q1. We drove a 4 percentage point improvement from price mix during the quarter. We also realized a 1.8 percentage point benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives, along with the wrap of some supply chain disruptions in the prior year., Gross margin improvement, Price mix,\\nSupply chain productivity initiatives, Supply chain disruptions, Adjusted operating margin bridge, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, These price and productivity benefits were slightly offset by cost of goods sold inflation, a margin headwind of 3.1%. Those factors, combined with small year-over-year favorability in A&P and SG&A, drove the 297 basis point improvement in operating margin for the quarter. Slide 22 details our margin performance by segment for Q1. Overall, continued progress on our productivity initiatives and positive price mix contributed to an increase in adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin across all four operating segments., Price and productivity benefits,\\nCost of goods sold inflation, Operating margin improvement, Segment performance, Adjusted operating\\nprofit and margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, It is worth noting that our refrigerated and frozen segment continued its very strong operating profit and margin recovery in the quarter with adjusted operating margin improving 294 basis points versus a year ago. Our Q1 adjusted EPS increased to $0.66, representing a 15.8% increase over the prior year. Higher adjusted gross profit and slightly lower A&P and adjusted SG&A were the positive contributors to our adjusted EPS performance in the quarter. These positives were partially offset by lower pension and post-retirement nonservice income, decreased equity method investment earnings, and higher interest expense., Refrigerated and frozen segment,\\nOperating profit and margin recovery, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted EPS, Contributors to\\nadjusted EPS performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 24 includes our key balance sheet and cash flow metrics. At the end of the quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.55 times, down from the end of fiscal \\'23. We will continue to prioritize reducing our debt and lowering our net leverage ratio in fiscal \\'24. Net cash flow from operations increased $180 million in the quarter, primarily driven by reduced investment in inventory versus the prior year., Net leverage ratio, Debt reduction,\\nNet cash flow from operations, Inventory investment, Fiscal \\'24 priorities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, While capex investment increased by approximately 20 million, Q1 free cash flow more than doubled from a year ago, coming in at 300 million. This strong free cash flow enabled us to pay down approximately 130 million of net short-term debt while also funding 157 million for the Q1 dividend, highlighting our focus on balanced capital allocation. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to prioritize paying down debt. As mentioned, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal \\'24, given the strong Q1 profit and margin performance and the confidence in our investment plans year to go as we continue to navigate a shifting consumer environment., Capex investment, Free cash flow,\\nNet short-term debt, Dividend payment, Debt repayment and share buyback, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 25 outlines our current fiscal \\'24 expectations for our three key metrics, including organic net sales growth of approximately 1% over fiscal \\'23, adjusted operating margin between 16% to 16.5%, and adjusted EPS between $2.70 and $2.75. Let\\'s take a closer look at how we expect to achieve that guidance during Q2 and the back half of fiscal \\'24 shown on Slide 26. During Q2, we expect to continue seeing low single digit organic net sales decline, but volume decline should improve versus Q1 as we wrap inflation-driven pricing actions from fiscal \\'23. As Sean mentioned, we will redeploy some of our strong gross profit into strategic investments behind quality, high ROI merchandising and increased A&P to support our brands., Organic net sales growth, Adjusted\\noperating margin, Adjusted EPS guidance, Q2 expectations, Strategic investments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We also expect operating margins to be down from Q1 with adjusted EPS approximately flat to Q1. In the back half of the year, we expect volume trends to return to year-over-year growth, which will help drive low single-digit organic net sales growth. We expect our trade and A&P investments to be higher than the first half, with margins flat to Q2 and second half fiscal \\'24 adjusted EPS approximately flat to the same period in fiscal \\'23. That concludes our prepared remarks for today\\'s call., Operating margins, Adjusted EPS, Volume\\ntrends, Trade and A&P investments, Second half fiscal \\'24 expectations, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2024, 1, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you for listening. I\\'ll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions., Thank you, Passing back to operator,\\nOpening line for questions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal \\'23 earnings call. I\\'ll start with a business update on the quarter and fiscal year and then share how we\\'re thinking about 2024 and beyond. Slide 6 outlines what we\\'d like you to take away from today\\'s call., Business update, Fiscal year 2023,\\nFiscal year 2024 guidance, Slide 6 outlines, Takeaways, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, In Q4, we delivered solid profit and margin growth despite the disruption from one of our frozen logistics partners, Americold, which impacted both our sales and costs during the quarter. For the full fiscal year, I\\'m proud of the way our team navigated a dynamic operating environment to deliver strong results. These efforts to execute against our fiscal \\'23 strategic priorities and the continued implementation of our playbook have our brands well positioned, following the volatility of the past few years. As you\\'ll see, our outlook for fiscal year 2024 reflects a transition toward a more normalized operating environment, as well as a continued commitment to our long-term financial algorithm., Profit and margin growth, Americold\\ndisruption, Full fiscal year results, Fiscal \\'23 strategic priorities, Fiscal \\'24 outlook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, With that overview, let\\'s dive into the results starting on Slide 7. Organic net sales for the quarter grew over 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal \\'22 and adjusted gross margin of 27%, representing a 216 basis-point increase over the fourth quarter last year. The full year results underscore the strength of our performance across all four metrics, including 6.6% organic net sales growth and 17.4% adjusted EPS growth compared to the prior-year period, as well as robust gross and operating margin improvement. Looking back at our priorities going into fiscal \\'23, we\\'re pleased to say that we delivered on each of them., Organic net sales growth, Adjusted gross\\nmargin, Full year results, Priorities for fiscal \\'23, Delivered on priorities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, We continued our disciplined pricing execution in the face of ongoing inflation, which helped to drive margin recovery, a top priority coming into fiscal \\'23. Our supply chain continued to improve as we made meaningful progress on our cost savings initiatives, which, in turn, led to a vast improvement in service levels. We remain committed to lowering our net leverage ratio, which was reduced from 4.0 to 3.6 times by the end of the fiscal year. And we did all of this while investing to maintain the brand strength that we\\'ve built up for many years running., Pricing execution, Supply chain\\nimprovement, Cost savings initiatives, Net leverage ratio reduction, Brand strength investment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s take a closer look at these priorities starting with the impact of our inflation-justified pricing actions on Slide 9. As you can see, pricing peaked in Q3 but remains almost 17% above the prior year due to our actions to offset ongoing COGS inflation. During the fourth quarter, elasticities did soften a bit but remain fairly consistent, well below historical norms and in line or better than competitors. Our strong execution was instrumental in driving margin recovery, which is detailed on Slide 10., Pricing actions, Margin recovery,\\nElasticities, Competition, Slide 9 and 10, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, As we\\'ve previously discussed, there is an inherent lag between the time when inflation hits and when we\\'re able to recover that cost through inflation-justified pricing. This lag effect results in temporarily compressed margins as we saw most notably throughout fiscal \\'22. We took great strides to recover our gross margin in fiscal \\'23, and Q4 was our third consecutive quarter of strong margin improvement, up 216 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Turning to Slide 11, we continue to advance our supply chain initiatives, investing to rebuild our own inventory, which helped us to deliver service levels of 95% as we exited the fiscal year., Gross margin improvement, Supply chain\\ninitiatives, Inventory rebuilding, Service levels, Slide 11, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, While we\\'re making strong progress in supply chain, it\\'s not yet back to normal as we experienced transitory disruptions in the quarter, such as the cybersecurity event at Americold. That said, we\\'re pleased with our progress so far and see more room for improvement in fiscal \\'24, including investing in technology and modernization as the operating environment continues to normalize. Slide 12 highlights one of the key ways in which we are investing to maintain brand strength, our persistent focus on modernizing brands through innovation. The innovations we\\'ve launched since fiscal 2018 generated nearly $1.8 billion in retail sales during the last fiscal year., Supply chain disruptions, Normalization of\\noperating environment, Investing in technology and modernization, Brand strength innovation, Slide\\n12, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, And unlike many in our space, we continue to innovate during the pandemic with new product launches since fiscal \\'21, now representing more than half of that total. Importantly, our innovation has built some really strong and sustainable platforms, including Bowls, Slim Jim Savage, and Duncan Hines EPIC. Our strategic frozen and snacks domains have been the focus of our innovation engine. As Slide 13 highlights, they\\'re growing domains, and we\\'ve helped architect that growth., Innovation during pandemic, New\\nproduct launches, Strong and sustainable platforms, Growing domains, Slide 13, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Over the past four years, the frozen and snacks categories in which we compete have grown 9% and 8%, respectively, outpacing total food growth. Within our portfolio, frozen and snacks together now represent almost 70% of our domestic retail dollar sales. And we\\'ve consistently increased our share within these strong and growing domains. Looking more closely at frozen, Slide 14 shows the growth of this category over the past nine years, which represents the time frame in which we reinvented our approach to frozen food., Frozen and snacks categories growth,\\nPortfolio share increase, Frozen category growth, Slide 14, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Since fiscal 2014, the frozen categories in which Conagra competes have grown from $29 million to $54 billion, representing a 7% CAGR. And Conagra has increased our share by nearly 500 basis points to become the leader in frozen. This growth is a testament to our continual effort to modernize and support our strong brands as part of the Conagra Way playbook. One example of that brand strength is how our unit sales stack up to our peers., Frozen category growth, Share\\nincrease, Brand strength, Modernization, Slide 14, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 15, even during the year of significant pricing, seven of our top 10 frozen product segments held or grew unit share in fiscal \\'23. The same is true in our snacks portfolio. As you can see on Slide 16, our two largest snacking platforms, meat snacks and microwave popcorn, also gained unit share during fiscal \\'23. Now, let\\'s turn to the year ahead., Frozen product segments growth,\\nSnacks portfolio growth, Unit share increase, Slide 15 and 16, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, As we continue to emerge from unprecedented operating conditions, including both COVID and the inflation super cycle, we anticipate fiscal \\'24 to be a transition toward a more normalized operating environment. That transition will include a few tailwinds and headwinds that are outlined on Slide 19. Starting with the tailwinds. In fiscal \\'24, we will be wrapping the various discrete supply chain disruptions that persisted throughout the year., Transition to normalized operating\\nenvironment, Supply chain disruptions, Tailwinds and headwinds, Slide 19, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, As the operating environment continues to normalize, we will also benefit from the ongoing advancement of our productivity initiatives. And we expect our investments in innovation to continue to deliver strong results, building upon our track record of success. Now, let\\'s talk headwinds. First, shifting consumer behavior., Productivity initiatives, Innovation,\\nConsumer behavior, Slide 19, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, As you can see in the weekly scanner data, food companies are starting to wrap pricing in the year-ago period and dollar sales are coming down as expected, but the rate of improvement in volume recovery is lagging. That suggests new consumer behavior shifts beyond the initial elasticity effects that occurred when pricing actions were initially taken. We have seen this dynamic since just after Easter, and it has been broad-based across many categories and competitors. And importantly, where we see it, it is usually not a trade-down to lower-priced alternatives within the category., Food companies pricing, Dollar sales,\\nVolume recovery, Consumer behavior shift, Slide 19, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Rather, it\\'s an overall category slowdown. The question is, why now, given the steadiness we have seen from the consumer for two years? There are several possibilities at the root of this. One behavior shift we have heard about from consumers is just buying fewer items overall, more of a hunkering down than a trading down. There are several potential reasons as to why, including this summer being more travel-intensive than last year., Category slowdown, Consumer behavior\\nshift, Travel intensity, Slide 19, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Overall, we view this dynamic as likely temporary behavior shift for consumers to stretch their budgets, but we have captured it as a near-term headwind in our outlook. Moving to the second headwind, while very limited, we have seen a few single ingredient brands become deflationary, and we will make appropriate price adjustments to reflect that. Finally, the reduction of pension income and decline in contribution from Ardent Mills compared to its strong fiscal \\'23 performance will impact our earnings performance compared to the prior year. To maximize our competitiveness this year, we will continue to execute our playbook and invest in our business., Consumer behavior shift, Near-term\\nheadwind, Single ingredient brands, Pension income reduction, Competitiveness, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, And Slide 20 highlights one of our most important investments, our biggest innovation slate to date. Our fiscal \\'24 innovation lineup features a compelling mix of convenient, value-added meals, restaurant experiences, and exciting licenses. We expect our most significant new innovation to be in distribution by the end of Q1 and build throughout the rest of the year. These innovations, coupled with our consumer and customer support, will help us effectively navigate the dynamic marketplace conditions., Innovation slate, Convenient meals,\\nValue-added meals, Restaurant experiences, Distribution, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, Slide 21 outlines our financial guidance for fiscal \\'24. We expect organic net sales growth of approximately 1% over fiscal \\'23, adjusted operating margin of 16% to 16.5%, and adjusted EPS between $2.70 to $2.75. As Dave will unpack further, our EPS guidance reflects our expectation for growth from the underlying business operations, which is being muted by the previously mentioned impacts from lower contribution from Ardent Mills and pension income. Overall, Conagra continues to benefit from strong brands, strong processes, and strong people, which are all working together to drive sustainable growth and margin expansion., Organic net sales growth, Adjusted\\noperating margin, Adjusted EPS, Contribution from Ardent Mills, Pension income, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer, With that, I will pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials in more detail., Financial guidance, Organic net sales\\ngrowth, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted EPS, Contribution from Ardent Mills, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. As Sean noted, we have made great progress from this time one year ago, as shown on this page. We navigated a challenging operating environment and successfully delivered on our priorities to implement inflation-justified pricing, drive gross margin recovery, reduce net leverage, and rebuild inventory levels, all while investing to maintain the strength of our brands. This enabled us to deliver strong full year results that exceeded our original fiscal \\'23 expectations on all metrics., Progress, Priorities, Gross margin\\nrecovery, Net leverage, Brand strength, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 24 highlights our results from the quarter and full fiscal year. During fiscal \\'23, we delivered strong top-line growth with full year organic net sales up 6.6% compared to fiscal \\'22, driven by our inflation-justified pricing and modest elasticities. Margin recovery was a top priority for fiscal \\'23, and our business delivered, increasing adjusted gross margin by 226 basis points and adjusted operating margin by 125 basis points for the full year. This margin enhancement contributed to strong full year adjusted EPS growth of 17.4%., Strong top-line growth, Organic net\\nsales growth, Margin recovery, Adjusted gross margin growth, Adjusted EPS growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 25 shows our net sales bridge for the quarter and full year. The increases in fourth quarter and full year organic net sales were driven by improvements in price mix, primarily from inflation-justified pricing actions, and were partially offset by a decrease in volumes. We estimate that our fourth quarter volume was impacted by the transitory supply chain disruptions from the cybersecurity incident at Americold, impacting revenue by approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. This disruption negatively impacted sales in our refrigerated and frozen segment during the fourth quarter, an impact of approximately 110 basis points for the quarter., Organic net sales growth, Price mix,\\nVolumes, Supply chain disruptions, Americold incident, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Despite this discrete situation in refrigerated and frozen, we were pleased to deliver solid sales growth in all other segments during the fourth quarter. And both our grocery and snacks, and refrigerated and frozen segments delivered 6.1% organic net sales growth for full year fiscal \\'23. We detail our adjusted operating margin bridge on Slide 27. As Sean discussed, we are pleased to have delivered a third consecutive quarter of strong gross margin improvement, up 216 basis points in Q4., Sales\\ngrowth, Segment performance, Gross margin improvement, Adjusted operating margin, Quarterly\\nperformance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We drove a 7.1% margin gain from improved price mix during the quarter and realized a 40 basis-point net benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives. These pricing and productivity benefits were partially offset by continued inflationary pressure with market inflation and market-based sourcing negatively impacting our margins by 2.1% and 3.3% respectively. Adjusted operating margin was 14.6% for the fourth quarter, which was a 39 basis-point decline versus a year ago. The strong gross margin improvement was more than offset by increased A&P investment and an increase in SG&A from both higher incentive compensation expense and transitory asset write-offs in the quarter., Margin\\ngain, Price mix, Supply chain productivity, Inflationary pressure, Adjusted operating margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, One additional callout on this slide, our cost of goods sold inflation headwind of 5.4% as calculated by netting our Q4 market inflation and our market-based sourcing. Previously, market-based sourcing was captured in our net productivity column. We believe this format is more meaningful to investors, and this change will be applied in our materials going forward. Slide 28 details our margin performance by segment for Q4., Cost of goods\\nsold inflation, Market inflation, Market-based sourcing, Segment margin performance, Netting and\\ncalculation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Refrigerated and frozen continued its strong operating profit and margin improvement in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin improving 286 basis points versus a year ago. Grocery and snacks operating margins were down 248 basis points due primarily to increased inventory reserves for excess seasonal inventory, along with unfavorable manufacturing overhead absorption. The international segment increased adjusted operating margin 497 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by pricing, while the foodservice segment adjusted operating margins were down 75 basis points due to some transitory asset write-offs. Also, as highlighted in our earnings release, results from our annual goodwill intangible impairment testing also negatively impacted reported profits, primarily in our grocery and snacks, and refrigerated and frozen segments., Refrigerated\\nand frozen operating profit, Grocery and snacks operating margins, International segment adjusted\\noperating margin, Foodservice segment adjusted operating margins, Goodwill intangible impairment\\ntesting, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The primary driver of the impairment charges was the increase in our discount rate due to the current interest rate environment. Slide 29 shows adjusted EPS bridges for the fourth quarter and full year compared to fiscal \\'22. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS from operations was flat as the increase in adjusted gross profit was offset by the increases in A&P and SG&A mentioned previously. Total EPS for Q4 was down 4.6% as the flat operating profit., Discount rate,\\nAdjusted gross profit, A&P and SG&A, Total EPS, Interest rate environment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, And benefit from our equity method investment earnings was more than offset by lower pension and post-retirement income, higher interest expense, and higher adjusted taxes. On the bottom half of the slide, you can see that our year-over-year EPS growth of 17.4% was entirely attributed to the operating profit increase of $0.41, which underscores the strength of the underlying business. The benefit of $0.11 from our Ardent Mills joint venture was offset by increased pension and interest expense. Slide 30 includes our key balance sheet and cash flow metrics., Equity method\\ninvestment earnings, Pension and post-retirement income, Interest expense, Adjusted taxes, EPS\\ngrowth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, At the end of fiscal \\'23, our net leverage ratio was 3.63 times, down from 3.99 times at the end of the prior year. Our net cash flow from operating activities reflects continued investments to rebuild our inventory levels. Going forward, we are well positioned to support sustained demand across categories. Year-to-date capex was $362 million at the end of fiscal \\'23, down from $464 million in the prior year due to the timing of projects., Net leverage\\nratio, Net cash flow from operating activities, Inventory levels, Capex, Sustained demand, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders as we paid $624 million in dividends in fiscal \\'23, up 7.2% versus fiscal \\'22. And we paid $150 million to repurchase shares in fiscal \\'23, up from $50 million a year ago. I\\'d like to spend a minute reviewing our guidance for fiscal \\'24. Slide 31 outlines our expectations for our three key metrics, including organic net sales growth of approximately 1% over fiscal \\'23, adjusted operating margin growth between 16% to 16.5%, and adjusted EPS between $2.70 to $2.75., Dividends,\\nShare repurchases, Guidance for fiscal \\'24, Organic net sales growth, Adjusted operating margin and\\nadjusted EPS growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Let\\'s take a closer look at the drivers of our adjusted EPS guidance on Slide 32. Compared to the prior-year period, we anticipate continued improvement to our adjusted gross profit to be offset by the impact of elevated investments in A&P and SG&A to support our innovation and our people, higher interest expense from interest rate increases approximating $450 million, and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 24%. That nets to adjusted EPS growth of 2% to 4% in our underlying business operations, or an adjusted EPS of $2.83 to $2.88. We also expect the growth in our underlying business operations to be offset by lower income from our Ardent Mills joint venture, as well as the reduction of pension income due to higher interest rates., Adjusted EPS\\nguidance, Adjusted gross profit, A&P and SG&A investments, Interest expense, Ardent Mills joint\\nventure and pension income, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As we previously discussed, Ardent Mills had a particularly strong fiscal \\'23 driven by favorable market conditions and the venture\\'s effective management through recent volatility in the wheat markets. As we transition toward a more normalized operating environment, we expect lower Ardent Mills income of approximately $150 million in fiscal \\'24, which is still a very strong operating performance relative to historical results as Ardent continues to mature as a business. I will now unpack a few additional assumptions behind our guidance shown here on Slide 33. Again, we expect to see easing inflationary pressures and improved supply chain operations in fiscal \\'24, which is reflected in our outlook., Ardent Mills income,\\nNormalized operating environment, Inflationary pressures, Supply chain operations, Fiscal \\'24\\nguidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We anticipate net cost of goods sold inflation of approximately 3% in fiscal \\'24 as we continue to emerge from the inflation super cycle, with targeted inflation-justified pricing actions that will become effective in the early second quarter of fiscal \\'24 to help offset elevated costs. From a supply chain perspective, we expect capex spend of approximately $500 million as we continue to make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation. We also expect the investments we are making to drive gross productivity savings of approximately 300 million during fiscal \\'24. Finally, we expect to reach a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.4 times by year-end fiscal \\'24 and remain on track to reach our target net leverage ratio of approximately three times by the end of fiscal \\'26., Inflation, Supply\\nchain, Capex, Gross productivity savings, Net leverage ratio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We see fiscal \\'24 as a transition toward a more normal operating environment, and we are reiterating our commitment to the long-term financial algorithm we unveiled at our investor day in July 2022, as shown here on Slide 34. This morning, we announced that our board of directors approved a 6% increase in our annualized dividend from $1.32 a share to $1.40 per share. This increase reflects confidence in our outlook and is in line with the targeted payout ratio. To sum things up, we made outstanding progress in fiscal \\'23 and as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities to drive value for shareholders., Fiscal \\'24, Normal\\noperating environment, Dividend increase, Strategic priorities, Shareholder value, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 4, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We believe Conagra is well positioned for long-term value creation. That concludes our prepared remarks for today\\'s call. Thank you for listening. I\\'ll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions., Conagra, Long-term\\nvalue creation, Prepared remarks, Questions, Operator, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. I hope you all are off to a happy and healthy start to the new year. Thank you for joining our second-quarter fiscal \\'23 earnings call., Good morning, Start\\nof new year, Fiscal \\'23 earnings call, Second quarter, Happy and healthy, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'d like to start by covering some key points for the quarter on Slide 5. Like our most recent wave of inflation-justified pricing, consumer demand for our products in the second quarter was strong as elasticities remained muted and well below historical norms. The ongoing durability of demand is a testament to the strength of our portfolio and demonstrates how the ConAgra Way playbook has positioned our brands to continue to resonate with consumers even in an inflationary environment. The successful execution of our playbook is clear in our second-quarter results., Inflation, Consumer\\ndemand, Strong brands, Second quarter results, ConAgra Way, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We drove a significant increase in our top line. We continued to have solid share performance across the portfolio, especially in our key frozen and snacks domains. And we made excellent progress, recovering both gross and operating margins. Operationally, we made good headway on our supply chain and productivity initiatives., Top line\\nincrease, Share performance, Gross margin recovery, Operating margin recovery, Supply chain and\\nproductivity initiatives, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, While we\\'re pleased with what we\\'ve accomplished to date, our supply chain is not yet fully normalized. That will improve. And overall, we see a long runway of opportunity ahead. We also continue to prioritize strengthening our balance sheet while making strategic investments in our business and returning capital to shareholders., Supply chain,\\nNormalization, Opportunity, Balance sheet, Strategic investments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In short, ConAgra had a strong quarter across the board. Given our positive results during the first half of fiscal \\'23, we have increased our expectations for the year, raising our full-year guidance across all metrics, including organic net sales growth, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted earnings per share. With that overview, let\\'s dive into the results on Slide 6. As you can see, we delivered organic net sales of more than 3.3 billion, representing an 8.6% increase over the prior-year period., Strong\\nquarter, Positive results, Full-year guidance, Organic net sales growth, Adjusted operating margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our adjusted gross margin of 28.2% represents a 310-basis-point increase over the second quarter of last year. And our adjusted operating margin of 17% represents a 237-basis-point increase over that same period. Adjusted EPS rose 26.6% from last year to $0.81 per share. Slide 7 goes into more detail on our sales results on a one- and three-year basis., Adjusted gross\\nmargin, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted EPS, Sales results (one-year and three-year basis), Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Given the timing, when the pandemic and inflation began to impact our industry, we believe that the three-year comparison provides important context to highlight the underlying strength of our performance. At the total ConAgra level, we grew retail sales more than 10% on a one-year basis and more than 26% on a three-year basis. We\\'re pleased with our solid share performance, including how our strong brands allowed us to largely maintain total company market share while taking several inflation-justified pricing actions, particularly during the past year. Notably, we\\'ve continued to drive robust share gains in key frozen and snacks strategic domains on both a one- and three-year basis., Strong\\nperformance, Share growth, Inflation-justified pricing, Market share, Key frozen and snacks domains, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, I want to spend a minute putting our sales growth in context. Slide 8 shows our performance over the past three years compared to our near-in peer group, including Campbell\\'s, General Mills, Kellogg\\'s, Kraft, Heinz, and Smucker\\'s. We have a great deal of respect for our peers, all of which have been navigating the same macro demand and inflation dynamics over the past three years. Among this group, ConAgra ranked second in dollar sales growth and first in unit sales performance., Sales growth,\\nPeer comparison, Macro demand, Inflation dynamics, Unit sales performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, It\\'s important to keep in mind that all of these peers have taken pricing actions to help offset inflation, and ConAgra is in the middle of the peer set in terms of the price-per-unit increases in this time period. It\\'s clear that consumers continue to appreciate the quality, convenience, and superior relative value that our strong brands have to offer, which has enabled ConAgra to perform extremely well on both an absolute and relative basis. Let\\'s take a closer look at our top-line performance during the second quarter by retail domain, starting with frozen on Slide 9. We maintained our momentum, delivering strong retail sales growth on both a one- and three-year basis, improving 9% and 26%, respectively., Strong brands,\\nPrice-per-unit increases, Retail domain (frozen), Top-line performance, Momentum, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, This growth was driven by a number of our key categories, including breakfast sausages and single-serve meals, which both experienced double-digit retail sales growth compared to last year. Turning to snacks on Slide 10, you can see a similar story. We drove a 14% increase in retail sales compared to the second quarter of fiscal \\'22 and a 41% increase over the second quarter of fiscal \\'20. The continued momentum of our snacks business is broad based across a number of categories., Breakfast\\nsausages, Single-serve meals, Snacks, Retail sales growth, Momentum, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Compared to last year, microwave popcorn was up 21%, seeds was up 18%, and meat snacks and hot cocoa both rose more than 14%. We also accelerated growth in our highly relevant staples portfolio, increasing retail sales 10% this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year, and 22% compared to the same period three years ago. This growth was led by pickles and whipped toppings, which grew more than 11% and 10%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. As I\\'ve mentioned, our strong top-line performance was primarily driven by inflation-justified price increases coupled with ongoing muted elasticities., Microwave\\npopcorn, Seeds, Meat snacks, Hot cocoa, Staples (pickles and whipped toppings), Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide\\xa012 details the relationship between pricing and volume over time. As you would expect, increased pricing does have an impact on volume, both for ConAgra and the total industry. However, you can see how elasticities have remained steady even as we have continued to increase the price per unit of our products to help offset ongoing cost inflation. And as we detailed a few minutes ago, ConAgra\\'s three-year CAGR on unit sales performance leads its near-in peer group., Pricing and\\nvolume, Elasticities, Total industry, Unit sales performance, Peer comparison, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The relatively modest elasticities, both compared to historic norms and our peers, are a testament to the strength of our brand. Now that we\\'ve unpacked the relationship between price and volume and the resulting net sales, I\\'d like to spend a few minutes on the relationship between net sales and COGS and the resulting impact on our margin performance on Slide 13. Generally speaking, when a business has strong brands, strong processes, and strong people, as ConAgra does, it is able to navigate inflationary cycles in discrete, predictable phases. As we have detailed for some time, when unprecedented inflation increased our cost of goods, we took strategic pricing actions to help offset the rising costs., Strong brands,\\nNet sales and COGS, Margin performance, Inflationary cycles, Strategic pricing actions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, However, there was an inherent lag between when we implemented pricing actions and when we realized the benefits of those actions in our top-line results. This pricing lag resulted in temporary margin compression. Furthermore, continued inflation extended this period of margin compression as new inflation-justified pricing actions led to additional lag effects. That is the dynamic we have experienced over the last several quarters as we continued to play catch-up by increasing price incrementally to account for the extraordinary extended rise in inflation., Pricing lag,\\nMargin compression, Inflation-justified pricing, Top-line results, Catch-up, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, End of the first quarter, we reached a significant inflection point in the relationship between net sales and COGS, marking the end of the temporary margin compression phase and the beginning of the margin recovery phase. As you can see in the chart, inflation has begun to moderate in certain areas, enabling our inflation-justified pricing actions to catch up to the rising costs. Slide 14 shows the impact this inflection has had on our gross margin results. As continuously rising inflation weighed on our COGS throughout fiscal \\'22 and into the first quarter of fiscal \\'23, our margins were compressed., Net sales and\\nCOGS, Margin compression, Inflation moderation, Gross margin results, Pricing actions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now, predictably, as pricing has finally caught up to COGS inflation, you can see the recovery of our gross margin to be more in-line with pre-pandemic levels. While our gross margin can vary quarter to quarter due to a range of internal and external factors, the strategic pricing actions we have successfully executed, combined with moderating inflation and our strong brands, position us well to recover and maintain a healthy gross margin going forward. Of course, inflation remains elevated in many areas, and we continue to closely monitor our cost just as we have in the past. We will continue to take appropriate inflation,-justified pricing actions as needed., Gross margin\\nrecovery, Pricing catching up to COGS inflation, Strategic pricing actions, Moderating inflation,\\nCost monitoring, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Another key driver of our margin recovery is our supply chain performance shown on Slide 15. This is due to a combination of macro factors, as well as the strategic initiatives we are executing to improve our operations. We made good progress on our supply chain during the second quarter, which benefited from improvements in the service we provided to our customers, continued headway on our ongoing productivity initiatives which remain on track to achieve the targets we outlined at our most recent Investor Day, more moderate increases in commodity prices, and improved inventory levels due to an increase in the availability of materials. The takeaway here is that we\\'re pleased with the progress we\\'re making, but industrywide challenges do persist., Supply chain\\nperformance, Macro factors, Strategic initiatives, Customer service, Industry-wide challenges, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, There\\'s more room for improvement as we advance our productivity initiatives and the macro environment continues to normalize. As a result of our strong performance this quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2023, we are raising our full-year guidance for all metrics detailed here on Slide 16. We now expect organic net sales to grow between 7% and 8% compared to fiscal \\'22; adjusted operating margin to be between 15.3% and 15.6%; and full-year adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 14%, or $2.60 to $2.70 per share. Dave will provide more detail on the underlying assumptions behind these expectations., Strong\\nperformance, Productivity initiatives, Macro environment, Full-year guidance, Assumptions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Before I turn the mic over, I want to summarize what I\\'ve covered today. Our strong performance during the first half of fiscal \\'23 was primarily driven by a combination of inflation-justified pricing actions and muted elasticities, reflecting the strength of our brands. Consumers continued to recognize the value our brands provide despite the higher prices, allowing us to gain share in key domains such as frozen and snacks. Our top-line growth was coupled with encouraging progress in a number of different areas of our supply chain that enabled us to operate more efficiently., Strong\\nperformance, Inflation-justified pricing, Muted elasticities, Brand strength, Supply chain\\nefficiency, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Together, these factors, as well as improvement in the inflationary environment, helped us recover our margins to near pre-pandemic levels. As a result of our strong performance, we\\'re raising our full-year fiscal \\'23 guidance for organic net sales, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted EPS. Finally, we\\'re looking forward to seeing everyone who can make it to CAGNY this year. We plan to host our annual kickoff dinner on February 20th and are scheduled to present the following morning., Strong\\nperformance, Inflationary environment, Full-year guidance, Attendance at CAGNY, Scheduled events, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We will follow up with more details on the event as we get closer. With that, I\\'ll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials from the quarter in more detail.\\xa0, Follow-up\\ndetails, Financial coverage, Event details, Passing the call, Closer look, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I\\'ll begin by discussing a few highlights from the quarter as shown on Slide 19. We are very pleased with our second-quarter results which reflect the ongoing strength of our business and successful execution of the ConAgra Way playbook. For the quarter, we delivered organic net sales growth of 8.6%, primarily driven by inflation-justified pricing and muted elasticities., Second-quarter\\nresults, Strength of business, Execution of ConAgra Way playbook, Organic net sales growth,\\nInflation-justified pricing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted gross margin increased to 28.2%, and adjusted gross profit dollars growth was up 21.7%, benefiting from higher organic net sales and productivity initiatives. The increase in adjusted gross profit, combined with another strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, contributed to adjusted EBITDA growth of 21.5%. Slide 20 provides a breakdown of our net sales. As you can see, the 8.6% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 17% improvement in price mix, which was a result of inflation-justified pricing actions that were reflected in the marketplace throughout the quarter., Adjusted gross\\nmargin, Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA growth, Net sales, Inflation-justified pricing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, This was partially offset by an 8.4% decrease in volume, primarily due to the elasticity impact of those pricing actions. However, the impact was favorable to both expectations and historical levels. Slide 21 shows the top-line performance for each segment in Q2. We are pleased with the robust net sales growth across our entire portfolio., Top-line\\nperformance, Volume impact, Elasticity impact, Segment growth, Expectations, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Net sales growth in our domestic retail portfolio remains strong with our grocery and snacks segment, and refrigerated and frozen segment, achieving net sales growth of 6.8% and 10.5%, respectively. The difference between the organic and reported net sales performance in our international segment reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. I\\'ll now discuss our Q2 adjusted margin bridge found on Slide 22. We drove a 12.2% benefit from improved price mix during the quarter, driven by the previously discussed inflation-justified pricing actions., Net sales\\ngrowth, International segment, Adjusted margin bridge, Price mix, Foreign exchange impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We also realized a 1.3% benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives. These pricing and productivity benefits were partially offset by continued inflationary pressure, with 11% gross market inflation negatively impacting our operating margins by 7.5% and a negative margin impact of 2.9% from market-based sourcing. As a reminder, as commodity prices rose quickly last year, we benefited from locking in contracted costs that were lower than the market. Even though we see commodity inflation moderating, we will not immediately realize a benefit to the P&L as our costs may remain higher than the spot market due to the timing of our contracts and when they roll off., Supply chain\\nproductivity, Inflationary pressure, Gross market inflation, Contracted costs, Timing of contracts, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 23 breaks down our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment. As Sean detailed, our decisive inflation-justified pricing actions, coupled with improved service levels and productivity, allowed us to successfully navigate ongoing inflationary pressures and industrywide supply chain challenges and deliver adjusted operating margin expansion in each segment during the quarter. We were also pleased that higher sales and productivity once again offset headwinds from inflation and elevated supply chain operating costs across all four segments in Q2. As a result of this continued strong performance, total adjusted operating profit increased 25.9% to 563 million during the quarter, despite an increase in adjusted corporate expense during the period primarily due to increased incentive compensation., Inflation-\\njustified pricing, Adjusted operating margin, Segment performance, Supply chain challenges, Total\\nadjusted operating profit, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 24 shows our adjusted EPS bridge for the quarter. Q2 adjusted EPS increased $0.17, or 26.6%, compared to the prior year. This significant increase was primarily driven by higher sales and gross profit, as well as a small benefit from a continued strong performance from Ardent Mills. Slightly offsetting these positives were higher A&P and adjusted SG&A compared to the prior-year period, as well as lower pension and post-retirement income, higher interest expense, and the impact of adjusted taxes., Adjusted EPS,\\nSales growth, Gross profit, A&P and SG&A, Taxes, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 25 reflects the continued progress we made on our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet. Our net leverage ratio remained at 3.9 times at the end of Q2, down from 4.3 times at the end of Q2 in the prior-year period. As we have previously communicated, Q2 is historically a heavier use-of-cash quarter from a working capital perspective. So, we expect progress on our net leverage reduction to be greater in the back half of the year., Balance sheet\\nstrengthening, Net leverage ratio, Working capital management, Cash usage, Expectations for second\\nhalf of year, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, With that in mind, we continue to expect to end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of roughly 3.7 times. Year-to-date capex of 188 million decreased by 69 million compared to the prior-year period, while free cash flow increased by 104 million year over year. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, as evidenced by our payment of 159 million in dividends in Q2 fiscal \\'23, and 309 million year to date. The first-half dividend increase of 27 million compared to the first half of fiscal \\'22 reflects the quarterly dividend rate $0.33 per share., Net leverage\\nratio, Capex, Free cash flow, Dividends, Dividend increase, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We also repurchased $100 million worth of shares in the second quarter, and $150 million worth of shares year to date, to offset most of the longer-term performance-based shares we estimate issuing. As we entered the second half of the fiscal year, we will continue to evaluate the highest and best use of capital to strengthen our balance sheet and optimize shareholder value. As Sean mentioned, we are raising our fiscal \\'23 guidance for net sales growth, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, given our strong performance in the first half of fiscal \\'23 and expectations for a solid performance for the balance of the year. Turning to Slide 27, I\\'d like to take a minute to walk through the considerations and assumptions behind our guidance., Share\\nrepurchases, Balance sheet strengthening, Guidance, Performance expectations, Assumptions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We expect gross inflation to continue but moderate through the remainder of the fiscal year, resulting in an inflation rate of approximately 10% for fiscal \\'23. Additional inflation-justified pricing actions that have previously been communicated and accepted will go into market in Q3. However, the magnitude of these pricing actions will be smaller and more targeted than previous pricing actions. As always, we will continue to monitor inflation levels and price, as needed, to manage future volatility., Inflation\\nrate, Pricing actions, Fiscal year expectations, Monitoring inflation, Price management, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We anticipate capex spend of approximately 425 million in fiscal \\'23 as we make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation. Approximately 200 million of the 425 million was spent in the first half of fiscal \\'23. Lastly, we expect interest expense to approximate 405 million, and pension and post-retirement income to approximate 25 million for the year, driven by the higher interest rate environment. Our full-year tax rate estimate remains approximately 24%., Capex spend,\\nGrowth and productivity priorities, Interest expense, Pension and post-retirement income, Tax rate\\nestimate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, To sum things up, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first half of fiscal \\'23, especially the recovery of Q2 adjusted gross margins to near pre-COVID levels. This, along with our expected continued positive business momentum, led to raising our full fiscal year \\'23 guidance. Our strong performance amid such a dynamic environment would not be possible without the hard work of our entire team and reflects the ongoing strength of our brands and successful execution of the ConAgra Way playbook. Looking forward, we remain committed to executing on our strategic business priorities and generating value for our shareholders., Strong\\nperformance, Business momentum, Guidance raise, ConAgra Way playbook, Commitment to strategic\\npriorities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2023, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, That concludes our prepared remarks for today\\'s call. Thank you for listening. I\\'ll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions., Conclusion,\\nPrepared remarks, Call, Questions, Operator, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Melissa. It\\'s great to be working with you again. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal \\'22 earnings call. I\\'ll start with what we would like you to take away from the call this morning., Good morning,\\nTakeaways, Working with Melissa, Fiscal \\'22 earnings call, Q4, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Throughout fiscal \\'22, our team took decisive actions to offset inflation and invest in our business. We faced heightened costs throughout the year but inflationary pressures were especially high in the fourth quarter. As a result, we implemented additional inflation-justified pricing actions to help offset the impact. We continued to make deliberate strategic investments in our business to better serve our customers and meet the strong consumer demand for our products as physical availability is an important part of maintaining and building trust and loyalty., Inflation,\\nPricing actions, Strategic investments, Consumer demand, Physical availability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'m pleased that our brands continue to resonate with consumers, demonstrated by broad-based share gains within the portfolio, particularly within our most strategic domains of Frozen and Snacks. We are continuing to drive growth, gain share in attractive categories, and we remain disciplined in executing the ConAgra Way to create lasting connections with consumers. As we\\'ve communicated throughout the year, the external factors I touched on a moment ago, as well as investments we made to maximize service and product availability in the face of supply constraints, all contributed to increased margin pressure. We continued to pull levers to manage these factors, and we were pleased to see margin improvement materialize in the fourth quarter in Grocery and Snacks, as well as Foodservice., Growth,\\nShare Gains, Margin Pressure, Investments, Discipline, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, This represents an important inflection point that we expect will extend to our Refrigerated and Frozen and our International businesses within fiscal \\'23. I also want to highlight the strong fourth quarter performance of our joint venture, Ardent Mills, which effectively managed through recent volatility in the wheat markets and continued to prove an effective hedge against inflation. Looking ahead to fiscal \\'23, we expect to see continued strength in our sales, driven by strong innovation, the impact of pricing actions, and progress in the supply chain to help offset continued inflation and elasticities. While we expect elasticities to increase incrementally from fiscal \\'22 levels as more inflation-justified pricing comes to market, we believe they will remain below historical levels., Growth,\\nInnovation, Pricing, Supply Chain, Elasticities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, These expectations are reflected in the fiscal \\'23 guidance we\\'re providing today. With this expected macroeconomic backdrop, we are lowering our long-term leverage target which Dave will discuss later. As you know, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet and keeping our investment-grade credit rating remain important to us. With that overview, let\\'s take a look at the results., Guidance,\\nMacroeconomic Backdrop, Balance Sheet, Credit Rating, Results, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, While we had planned for high inflation, it was higher than we anticipated. Slide 7 shows our cost of goods increased 16% in fiscal \\'22, far higher than the 9% we anticipated at the time of our fiscal \\'21 fourth quarter call a year ago. Inflation was particularly acute during the fiscal \\'22 fourth quarter when our cost of goods sold were 17% higher than the year-ago period and 24% higher on a two-year basis. The elevated levels of inflation we experienced in fiscal \\'22, particularly in the fourth quarter, required decisive actions in response., Inflation, Cost of Goods Sold, Supply Chain, Decisive Actions, Response, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, A critical part of that response included the inflation-justified pricing we implemented throughout fiscal \\'22. On Slide 8, you can see the change in on-shelf pricing by quarter. On-self prices for our brands rose across all three domestic retail domains compared to the same period a year ago and also increased in Q4 as we experienced additional inflationary pressures. We closely monitor the impact of these pricing actions on volumes., Inflation-Justified Pricing, On-Shelf Pricing, Domestic Retail Domains, Volume Impact, Monitoring, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve been pleased that price elasticity has remained below historical levels. Slide 9 demonstrates that unit sales have stayed largely consistent on a three-year basis, even as the on-shelf prices for our brands have increased. Even in Q4, as more significant inflation-justified pricing took effect, the increase in elasticity was relatively modest and below historical norm. As we monitor the impact of our pricing actions on volume, we looked at the relative impact between branded foods and private label., Pricing\\nElasticity, Unit Sales, Historical Norms, Inflation-Justified Pricing, Volume Impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, While private label is gaining some share more broadly in food, we have not seen notable migration toward private label in the heavily branded categories in which we compete. The superior relative value of our products continues to resonate with our customers and our consumers, and the resiliency of our portfolio means we are well-positioned to take additional action in fiscal \\'23 if we continue to experience incremental inflation. As a result of our decisive actions, we\\'re beginning to see the expected recovery in our margin performance. As I mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter represented an important inflection point as we saw margin improvements materialize in Grocery and Snacks and Foodservice which helped drive fourth-quarter operating margin improvement for the total company., Resilience, Share Gain, Inflation, Margin Improvement, Recovery, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As I already noted, we expect our Refrigerated and Frozen and International segments to deliver operating margin improvement as fiscal \\'23 progresses. As you can see on Slide 11, our team delivered solid Q4 results in the face of a highly dynamic and challenging operating environment. Compared to the fourth quarter of \\'21, organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased at just under 7%, with growth in all four segments. And importantly, adjusted operating margin increased approximately 100 basis points, and adjusted EPS was up over 20%., Refrigerated and Frozen Segment, International Segment, Operating Margin Improvement, Adjusted EPS,\\nDynamic Environment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'d like to briefly detail our performance across our three retail domains, starting with our Frozen business on Slide 12. Frozen continues to be one of the strongest businesses in our portfolio and offers modern attributes, convenience, and quality to make it the perfect fit for today\\'s consumer. In Q4, we continued to deliver strong growth on both a one-year and three-year basis. And within this consumer domain, we\\'ve seen growth across key categories, highlighted by more than double-digit year-over-year growth in both plant-based protein and single-serve meals., Frozen\\nBusiness, Strong Growth, Modern Attributes, Consumer Domain, Key Categories, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now let\\'s talk about Snacks. As shown on Slide 13, we\\'ve seen a meaningful acceleration in retail sales growth in our Snacks business over the last three years. In the fourth quarter, our Snacks business grew 11% year over year. That equates to 34% growth over the same period in 2019., Retail\\nSales Growth, Snacks Business, Acceleration, Fourth Quarter Growth, 2019 Comparison, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In this domain, we\\'ve driven growth in key categories, including meat snacks, hot cocoa, microwave popcorn, and salty snacks. Our retail sales of ingredients and enhancers, and shelf-stable meals and sides have also been growing meaningfully over a three-year period, and that trend continued in the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 14, this business grew 5% year over year and 10% on a three-year basis. In particular, we saw a large increase in the retail sales for syrup, which was up nearly 20% in Q4 on a two-year basis., Key\\nCategories, Retail Sales Growth, Three-Year Basis, Fourth Quarter Growth, Syrup Sales Increase, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we execute our ConAgra Way playbook, innovation has remained a key to our success across the portfolio. Slide 15 shows the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and a modernized portfolio. During the fourth quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year-ago period, and once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including with toppings, single-serve meals, and plant-based protein. Looking at Slide 16, you can see that we continue to grow sales on both a one- and three-year basis., Innovation, Portfolio Modernization, Key Categories, Fourth Quarter Growth, Sales Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Total ConAgra retail sales were up 15.8% on a three-year basis for the year. We also continued to gain share in the important Frozen and Snacks categories with our category-weighted share growth up both on a one-year and three-year basis. With that context for fiscal \\'22, let\\'s turn to our outlook for fiscal \\'23. We expect our strong brands, on-trend innovation, effective pricing, and strengthened supply chain to drive top-line growth and margin improvement., Total\\nConAgra Retail Sales, Share Gain in Frozen and Snacks Categories, Fiscal \\'23 Outlook, Strong Brands,\\nEffective Pricing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Continued inflationary pressure in fiscal \\'23 is expected to result in incremental increases in elasticity, which, overall, we anticipate will continue to remain below historical levels. Our outlook also reflects our expectation that we will have higher capex and interest expense in fiscal \\'23, lower pension income, and that the elevated performance from Ardent Mills in fiscal \\'22 will moderate. We look forward to sharing more details about our expectations for the year at our upcoming Investor Day. In 2023, we expect organic net sales growth of 4% to 5%, adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%, adjusted EPS growth of 1% to 5%., Inflationary Pressure, Capex and Interest Expense, Pension Income, Ardent Mills Performance, 2023\\nOutlook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Before I turn the call over to Dave, I\\'ll remind you that my team and I are looking forward to hosting an Investor Day on July 27th to discuss our plans for the future. In response to feedback, we\\'ve decided to hold our event in a virtual-only format to best accommodate our investors and analysts. Registration, dial-in, and Q&A details for the virtual event are available on our website. Dave, over to you., Investor\\nDay, Virtual Format, Registration Details, Q&A Details, Future Plans, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I\\'ll start with some highlights from the quarter and full year, which are shown on Slide 22. Overall, we feel very good about how we are exiting fiscal \\'22 and the way we navigated the dynamic operating environment that impacted our entire industry throughout the year. During fiscal \\'22, we delivered strong top-line growth with full-year organic net sales up 3.8% compared to fiscal \\'21, reflecting the continued relevancy of our portfolio to consumers., Strong\\nTop-Line Growth, Dynamic Operating Environment, Full-Year Organic Net Sales, Portfolio Relevancy,\\nFiscal \\'22 Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, While higher-than-expected cost of goods sold inflation weighed on our adjusted operating margins throughout the year, we were encouraged to see Q4 operating margins improve versus year-ago. Overall, our full fiscal year \\'22 adjusted operating margins decreased by 312 basis points versus last year to 14.4%, which was in line with the revised expectations we provided during our third quarter call. Fiscal \\'22 adjusted EPS of $2.36 was also in line with our revised expectations. Turning to Slide 23, you can see our net sales bridge for the quarter and full year., Cost of\\nGoods Sold Inflation, Q4 Operating Margins, Full Fiscal Year \\'22 Adjusted Operating Margins,\\nAdjusted EPS, Net Sales Bridge, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, During the fourth quarter, the 6.8% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 13.2% improvement in price mix as a result of continued inflation-justified pricing actions as well as favorable brand mix. This was partially offset by a 6.4% decrease in volume. The headwinds from the divestiture of our Egg Beaters business and the impact of foreign exchange were the final contributors toward the 6.2% increase in total ConAgra Brands net sales during the fourth quarter. The bottom half of the slide highlights the drivers of our net sales growth for full-year fiscal \\'22 versus the prior year., Organic\\nNet Sales, Price Mix, Volume, Foreign Exchange, Full-Year Fiscal \\'22 Net Sales Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The highlight here is the 3.8% organic net sales growth that I just mentioned which showcases the underlying health of the business and our ability to execute inflation-justified pricing actions. This point is reinforced on Slide 24, which shows the top-line performance of each of our segments. As Sean mentioned, we are pleased that net sales continued to grow across the portfolio for both the quarter and full year when compared to the respective year-ago periods. We also continued to see market share gains, reflecting the strength of our brands., Organic\\nNet Sales Growth, Segment Performance, Market Share Gains, Brand Strength, Full-Year Fiscal \\'22 Top-\\nLine Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The sales momentum of the business is strong as we exit fiscal \\'22. We detailed our adjusted operating margin bridge on Slide 25. In aggregate, our adjusted operating margin was 15% for the fourth quarter, approximately 100 basis points above the year-ago period. As you can see, we realized a 9% benefit from favorable price mix and a 1.8% benefit from net productivity in our supply chain., Strong\\nSales Momentum, Adjusted Operating Margin Bridge, Price Mix Benefit, Net Productivity Benefit,\\nSupply Chain Efficiency, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Although our productivity in the quarter was below historic levels given continued supply chain challenges, the rate was up compared to Q3, and we are seeing steady improvement in our supply chain operations as we exit fiscal year \\'22. The price and productivity benefits were more than offset by gross market inflation of 17.3%, which impacted our operating margins by more than 12%. I will unpack the inflation impacts in more detail shortly. Together, these factors contributed to the 147-basis-point decrease in our adjusted gross margin for the quarter compared to the year-ago period., Supply\\nChain Challenges, Productivity Improvement, Gross Market Inflation, Adjusted Gross Margin Decrease,\\nInflation Impacts, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Advertising and promotion costs for the quarter decreased 38.7%, driven primarily by lapping the significant increases in A&P during Q4 last year. This decrease contributed 1.1% to overall adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A costs also declined during the quarter, driven by decreased incentives and deferred compensation, contributing an additional 1.3% benefit. Slide 26 breaks down our adjusted operating margins by segment., Advertising and Promotion Costs, Adjusted Operating Margin, Segment Performance, SG&A Costs,\\nDepreciation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We were encouraged to see both our adjusted gross margins and adjusted operating margins in our Grocery and Snacks and Foodservice segments hit inflection points during the fourth quarter and begin to improve compared to last year. The recovery in these segments drove the 13.5% year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating profit during the fourth quarter. Our Refrigerated and Frozen segment was most impacted by higher-than-anticipated input cost inflation in Q4, particularly in proteins and edible oils. The above-forecast inflation in Refrigerated and Frozen has pushed forward the lag until additional inflation-justified pricing is reflected in market., Adjusted\\nGross Margins, Adjusted Operating Margins, Segment Performance, Input Cost Inflation, Pricing\\nActions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As we have mentioned previously, we believe our Refrigerated and Frozen segment, and our Frozen portfolio in particular, is well positioned for further success. Our International segment was also impacted by higher-than-anticipated inflation and some FX headwinds versus prior year. Pricing actions were implemented as planned but were not enough to fully offset the cost headwinds incurred. As Sean mentioned earlier, we expect to see operating margins expand in both our Refrigerated and Frozen and International segments in fiscal \\'23 as pricing actions catch up to the recent inflation., Refrigerated and Frozen Segment, Frozen Portfolio, International Segment, Pricing Actions, Fiscal\\n\\'23 Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, I would like to take a deeper dive into the gross market inflation we experienced during the quarter, shown here on Slide 27. Inflation continued to rise to over 17%, above the high end of the range that we were anticipating at the time of our third-quarter call. It rose most acutely for commodities that are particularly difficult to hedge, including chicken and pork. Even though we forecasted a significant acceleration of our chicken and pork costs in Q4, as depicted in the charts on the right, actual inflation came in even higher, especially in chicken, which hit record levels compared to our expectations as of the Q3 call., Gross\\nMarket Inflation, Commodity Prices, Hedgeability, Cost Forecasts, Record Levels, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We continue to pull on a number of levers to offset the elevated costs, including an additional round of inflation-justified pricing actions implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal \\'22 that will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal \\'23 and new pricing that will take effect in the second quarter of fiscal \\'23. Another strong performance by Ardent Mills also proved to be an effective inflation hedge in our Q4 results. Slide 28 details our adjusted EPS bridge for the quarter compared to last year. The sales increase and recovery of overall operating margins was the primary driver of the increase in our adjusted EPS during the fourth quarter, contributing $0.09., Pricing\\nActions, Inflation Hedge, Adjusted EPS Bridge, Sales Increase, Operating Margins Recovery, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We also saw a $0.02 benefit from our equity method investment earnings, which increased 42.1% during the quarter to $48 million due to solid results from Ardent Mills as effective management at the joint venture allowed it to capitalize on volatile market conditions. A benefit from pension and postretirement non-service income and higher adjusted taxes were the additional drivers of our EPS change. The $0.65 in adjusted diluted EPS that we generated for the quarter brought our full-year adjusted EPS to $2.36, down 10.6% from fiscal \\'21. On a two-year compounded annualized basis, full-year fiscal \\'22 adjusted EPS increased 1.7%., Equity Method\\nInvestment Earnings, Pension and Postretirement Non-Service Income, Adjusted Taxes, Full-Year\\nPerformance, Two-Year Compounded Annualized Growth Rate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Slide 29, you can see our balance sheet and cash flow metrics for the quarter and full year. We feel good about ending the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of four times, which was generally in line with the target we outlined during our third-quarter call. We aim to continue decreasing this ratio moving forward as we prepare for more market volatility which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Capital expenditures decreased by $42 million year over year to $464 million, or 4% of net sales., Balance\\nSheet Metrics, Cash Flow Metrics, Net Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio, Capital Expenditures, Market Volatility, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Lastly, we continued to prioritize returning capital to shareholders as we paid $582 million in dividends in fiscal \\'22. I\\'d now like to spend a minute talking about our guidance for fiscal \\'23. Slide 30 outlines our expectations for our three key metrics, including organic net sales growth of plus 4% to plus 5%, adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%, and adjusted EPS growth between plus 1% and plus 5%. In addition, we aim to continue reducing our long-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to three times, as I alluded to earlier., Dividend\\nPayments, Fiscal \\'23 Guidance, Organic Net Sales Growth, Adjusted Operating Margin, Long-term Net\\nDebt-to-EBITDA Ratio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The macro-environment remains volatile, and this target reflects our strategy to maintain an even stronger balance sheet as we navigate continued headwinds moving forward, and we continue to remain committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating. Before we open the line up for questions, I want to unpack the assumptions behind our guidance, shown here on Slide 31. We expect the high inflationary environment we experienced in fiscal \\'22 to continue into fiscal \\'23, with levels in the low teens off of the fiscal \\'22 gross market inflation of 16%. As I noted, we have communicated additional inflation-justified pricing actions to help offset these elevated costs, which we anticipate being realized during the first and second quarters of fiscal \\'23, and we are keeping a close eye on how these actions impact elasticities., Macro-\\nEnvironment, Balance Sheet Strength, Investment-Grade Credit Rating, Fiscal \\'23 Guidance, Inflation-\\nJustified Pricing Actions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We forecast the environment to remain dynamic through fiscal \\'23, with the elasticities increasing from fiscal \\'22 levels but remaining below pre-COVID historical levels. From an investment perspective, we expect capex spend of approximately $500 million, as we prioritize reinvesting in the business as a lever to combat inflation with a focus on capacity expansion and productivity enablers. We also plan to increase our SG&A investment to support talent, infrastructure, and continued automation. Interest expense is anticipated to be roughly $410 million for the year; pension and postretirement income, approximately $25 million; and our tax rate estimate is approximately 24%., Fiscal \\'23\\nForecast, Elasticities, Capex Spend, SG&A Investment, Interest Expense, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, These three items combined represent an approximate $0.13 headwind to fiscal \\'22 adjusted EPS and are incorporated into our fiscal \\'23 EPS guidance of plus 1% to plus 5%. The higher interest rate environment is the main driver of the expected interest expense increase in pension income decline. We anticipate Ardent Mills having another strong year but expect fiscal \\'23 results to moderate versus fiscal \\'22, particularly versus the elevated performance in the second half of fiscal \\'22. To reiterate, we are confident about how ConAgra ended the year and are optimistic about our future opportunities., Interest\\nExpense, Pension Income, Fiscal \\'23 EPS Guidance, Ardent Mills Performance, Future Opportunities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 4, David Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We are looking forward to walking through these opportunities and our strategies to unlock them in more detail at our Investor Day later this month. That concludes our prepared remarks for today\\'s call. Thank you for listening. I\\'ll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions., Investor\\nDay, Strategies, Opportunities, Prepared Remarks, Call Conclusion, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Bayle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will detail our results for the quarter and our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. We\\'ll then open the line to your questions., Third\\nQuarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call, Results, Outlook, Questions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'d like to start with the key messages we want to share with you this morning. As we navigate a dynamic external environment, our team delivered a solid Q3 that was largely in line with our expectations on the top line and adjusted EPS. We remained laser-focused on successfully executing the Conagra Way playbook by creating superior products and ensuring physical and mental availability to create lasting connections between consumers and our brands. This enabled us to deliver a robust plus 6% organic net sales growth for the third quarter in line with what we expected., Key\\nMessages, External Environment, Top-Line Performance, Adjusted EPS, Organic Net Sales Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The strength of our top line can be measured both in the absolute and relative to peers as we gain share in key categories on a one- and two-year basis. And it\\'s important to note that in response to inflation-driven pricing that has been executed in the market to date, elasticities have been favorable to historical patterns, even more so than what we expected. Unit demand remained strong as consumers continue to recognize the superior relative value that our portfolio provides. As worldwide events contributed to an already challenging environment, our teams remained agile and nimble to respond effectively and continued to serve our customers., Strength\\nof Top Line, Share Gain, Elasticities, Unit Demand, Agility and Nimbleness, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our third quarter results reflect strong contributions from our latest innovations. And we have another exciting innovation slate planned for fiscal 2023. But we also experienced higher-than-anticipated inflation as the third quarter unfolded. In the face of these heightened costs, we again made the deliberate decision to continue to invest to service orders and meet the strong consumer demand for our products, ensuring physical availability as an important part of maintaining and building trust and loyalty with consumers., Strong\\nContributions, Innovations, Fiscal 2023, Higher-Than-Anticipated Inflation, Investment and Physical\\nAvailability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, While these strategic investments contributed to margin compression in Q3, we believe making them was the right decision as we positioned Conagra for the long term. Ultimately, we landed Q3 EPS a bit differently than we previously anticipated, but we did get there. Our adjusted Q3 EPS actualized in line with our expectations. Above-forecasted performance in our Ardent Mills joint venture offset incremental Q3 inflation headwinds., Strategic\\nInvestments, Margin Compression, EPS Expectations, Above-Forecasted Performance, Incremental\\nInflation Headwinds, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, the environment isn\\'t getting much easier in the near term. We now expect an additional $100 million of market inflation in Q4. The updated Q4 inflation forecast equates to a 26% increase versus two years ago. As we will detail further today, this higher-than-expected inflation is disproportionately impacting some of our strongest businesses, including meat snacks and frozen., Market\\nInflation, Q4 Forecast, Strongest Businesses, Impact of Inflation, Near-Term Environment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Keep in mind that these businesses rely on inputs, like protein and dairy, which are harder to offset in the short term, and that frozen requires more specialized temperature control transportation. But as we started to see this latest wave of inflation coming, we took action on pricing just as we have throughout the year. These new pricing moves go into effect in Q1 of fiscal \\'23 and are highly targeted toward frozen and protein snacks. These businesses have been distinguished by innovation-driven sales growth, favorable elasticities, continued share gains, and limited private label competition., Businesses\\nRelying on Inputs, Pricing Moves, Targeted towards Frozen and Protein Snacks, Share Gains, Limited\\nPrivate Label Competition, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, So, although we are experiencing pressure on our total company margins near term, we will see the benefits of the new pricing actions we\\'ve taken to offset this latest wave of inflation beginning in Q1 of fiscal \\'23. With this context, we\\'re updating our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Our updated outlook reflects expectations for continued strong consumer demand for our product and lower-than-historical elasticities, as well as the further increase in our gross inflation expectations for the year and the timing of the related pricing actions. Specifically, we now expect organic net sales for the year to be plus 4%, and we project adjusted diluted EPS to land at about $2.35, which translates to approximately $2.65 of earnings power when taking into account the impact of the lag between inflation and our in-market pricing this fiscal year., Total\\nCompany Margins, New Pricing Actions, Outlook for Remainder of Fiscal 2022, Consumer Demand, Gross\\nInflation Expectations, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And with that overview, let\\'s dig into the quarter. As you can see on Slide 6, our team delivered solid Q3 results in the face of a highly dynamic and challenging operating environment. On a two-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the third quarter increased at just under 8% and adjusted EPS grew by over 11%. Looking at Slide 7, you can see that we continued to grow sales on both a one- and two-year basis., Solid Q3\\nResults, Dynamic Operating Environment, Organic Net Sales Growth, Adjusted EPS Growth, Continued\\nSales Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Total Conagra domestic retail sales were up 18.5% on a two-year basis in the quarter. We also continued to gain share in the quarter with our category weighted share growth up on both a one- and two-year basis. And on a relative basis, our share performance continued to compare favorably to the industry overall and to our largest peers. Slide 8 demonstrates that we gained category share at levels that outpaced our top 15 peers during the quarter., Total\\nConagra Domestic Retail Sales, Share Gain, Category Weighted Share Growth, Share Performance,\\nCategory Share Gain, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, If you take a look at the chart on the right, the share gains in our frozen and snacks domains were particularly notable. As you can see on Slide 9, our performance in frozen and snacks has driven our total Conagra share gains fiscal year to date and during the third quarter. Importantly, our categories are healthy, attractive, and growing. As you can see from the chart on the left, our frozen and snacks domains have grown nearly 8% and 9% during the fiscal year to date and third quarter, respectively., Share\\nGains, Frozen Domain, Snacks Domain, Total Conagra Share Gains, Category Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, So, we\\'re not just gaining share, we\\'re gaining share in some of the most attractive parts of the store. These results are holding, notwithstanding our need to put significant inflation-driven pricing into the market. On Slide 10, you can see the extent of our recent actions, which increased in Q3 and have accelerated over the last five weeks. On-shelf prices for our brands rose across all three domestic retail domains compared to the same period a year ago with inflation-driven price increases most concentrated in frozen and protein snacks., Gaining\\nShare, Attractive Parts of the Store, Inflation-Driven Pricing, Recent Actions, Price Increases, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We implement these pricing actions, we\\'re watching the impact on volumes closely, and we are pleased that the price elasticity has remained below historical levels. Slide 11 demonstrates that unit sales have remained consistently positive on a two-year basis, even as the on-shelf prices for our brands have increased. This dynamic is a testament to the fact that despite the broad-based inflationary environment we\\'re operating in, the targeted nature of our inflation-driven pricing actions and the superior relative value of our products continue to resonate with our customers and consumers. A great example of this is our Banquet brand in our frozen business., Pricing\\nActions, Volume Impact, Price Elasticity, Historical Levels, Targeted Pricing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we\\'ve discussed before, the Banquet brand is a mainstay in American households and has undergone considerable modernization to ensure that the brand delivers on its promise of relevant flavors, hearty portions, and a great value. Consumers see the relative quality and availability of our Banquet products and continue to choose Banquet despite inflation-driven price increases. Banquet\\'s volume has remained consistent as prices went up in stark contrast to a key competitor. We see a similar story in our snacks domain with Slim Jim, another brand that has made lasting connections with its consumers through perpetual modernization, relevancy, and availability., Banquet\\nBrand, Modernization, Consumer Choice, Volume Consistency, Competitor Comparison, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Despite the increased cost of protein and associated pricing actions, Slim Jim volumes have increased considerably, far outpacing a key competitor. In addition to strong relative performance compared with other branded products, we also continue to maintain share relative to private label products. Slide 14 shows private label dollar share across the edible industry at large, across the categories in which Conagra competes, and across Conagra\\'s frozen and snacking categories specifically. Two things stand out about this chart., Despite\\nIncreased Cost, Slim Jim Volumes, Share Relative to Private Label, Private Label Dollar Share,\\nCategory Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, First, we compete in parts of the store with less private label penetration than the edible space at large. And second, the share of private label sales has remained stable amid the highly inflationary environment over the past several years. We believe the data shows that consumers are finding comfort in the quality, reliability, and familiarity that national brands provide, particularly modernized brands like those in our portfolio. And we have not backed off from our modernization focus in the current environment., Private\\nLabel Penetration, Share of Private Label Sales, Modernization Focus, Comfort and Familiarity,\\nQuality and Reliability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Innovation has remained a key to our success. Slide 15 shows the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and a modernized portfolio. During the third quarter, our innovation outperformed with the strong results we delivered in the year-ago period. And once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including with toppings, frozen vegetables, and frozen plant-based meat alternatives., Innovation, Disciplined Approach, New Products, Modernized Portfolio, Category Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And we have another exciting lineup of new innovations set to hit the shelves during fiscal 2023. The new products you see on Slide 16 are already being accepted by customers who have come to respect the innovation and marketing engine at Conagra and our ability to drive demand in key categories. Our ongoing investments in e-commerce also continue to yield strong results in the third quarter. We delivered compelling quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business as we outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth in Q3, building on our momentum from fiscal 2021., Innovation, Marketing, E-commerce, Growth, Sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Looking at the chart on the right, you can see that our e-commerce business has continued to grow as a percentage of our total retail sales as we continue to invest behind supporting our brands. I\\'d like to briefly detail our performance across our three retail domains, starting with our frozen business on Slide 18. Frozen continues to be one of the strongest businesses in our portfolio and offers convenience and quality that make it the perfect fit for today\\'s consumer. In Q3, we continued to deliver strong growth on both a one- and two-year basis., E-commerce, Growth, Retail Sales, Investment, Quality, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And within this domain, meat substitutes, single-serve meals, desserts, and multi-serve meals were the main drivers of our results. Driven by the appeal of our products to the consumer and the investments we\\'ve made in brand building and innovation, our leading frozen portfolio again grew share in Q3, both in the domain overall and within key categories. Now, let\\'s talk about snacks. Slide 20 highlights the meaningful acceleration in retail sales growth that we\\'ve experienced in our snacks business., Innovation, Growth, Investment, Consumer Appeal, Retail Sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the third quarter, our snacks business grew 11% year over year. That equates to more than 30% growth over the same period in 2020. Within snacks, we have seen growth across key categories highlighted by more than 20% year-over-year growth in meat snacks. Similar to our frozen business., Growth,\\nYear-Over-Year Growth, Key Categories, Meat Snacks, Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our Snacks portfolio is gaining share in this large and growing domain. We delivered share gains in multiple snack categories, including several popcorn categories, meat snacks, and hot cocoa. Our staples retail sales have also been growing over a two-year period, and that trend continued in Q3. Specifically, we saw very large increases in retail sales for refrigerated whipped toppings and cooking spray, both of which were up over 25% in Q3 on a two-year basis., Growth,\\nShare Gains, Categories, Retail Sales, Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Since the onset of COVID-19, many consumers have rediscovered their kitchens, reinvigorating the relevance of our staples portfolio. As demonstrated on Slide 23, our staples portfolio has increased its share during this critical time frame, with two-year share gains across many key categories, including Asian sauces, refrigerated whipped toppings, syrup, Sloppy Joe, and canned meat. When you take a step back and look across our portfolio and the retail domains in which we operate, you see broad-based strength and healthy categories. We are driving growth, gaining share in attractive categories, and remain disciplined in executing the Conagra Way to create lasting connections with consumers., Growth,\\nShare Gains, Categories, Retail Domains, Consumer Connection, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The health of our business is what will enable us to deliver profitable growth for the long term. In the immediate, however, we face a volatile cost environment that continues to be very challenging. As the third quarter unfolded, our expectations for full year fiscal 2022 gross inflation increased from approximately 14% to approximately 16%. The biggest driver of this change is the market inflation that we now expect for Q4., Health of\\nBusiness, Cost Environment, Inflation, Expectations, Long-Term Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, At the time of our Q2 call, we expected Q4 gross inflation of about 11%. Today, we expect a Q4 gross inflation of approximately 16%. On a two-year basis, Q4 gross inflation is expected to be an unprecedented 26%. And as I noted earlier, these incremental costs are disproportionately impacting our strong frozen and snacks businesses, both rely on inputs like protein and dairy, which are harder to offset in the short term and, in the case of frozen, require specialized temperature-controlled transportation., Inflation, Costs, Businesses, Transportation, Short-Term, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As noted on Slide 25, we\\'re updating our guidance for the full year to reflect the trends I just covered. We now expect organic net sales growth of approximately 4%, adjusted operating margin to be approximately 14.5%, adjusted EPS to be approximately $2.35, and, as I just mentioned, we\\'re updating our gross inflation guidance to approximately 16%. We\\'re also providing guidance for the fourth quarter to reflect the higher-estimated inflation and the lag in the offsetting pricing actions. In Q4, we expect organic net sales growth of approximately 7%, adjusted operating margin of approximately 15.5%, adjusted EPS of approximately $0.64, and gross inflation of approximately 16%., Guidance,\\nTrends, Inflation, Pricing Actions, Q4 Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, While the environment remains challenging, our team continues to stay focused on executing our Conagra Way playbook and positioning our business for long-term growth and value creation. We delivered strong sales growth and continue to gain share, particularly in our healthy and growing frozen and snacks categories, both of which continue to resonate with consumers despite necessary price adjustments to help offset the impact of inflation. While accelerated inflation has put pressure on our near-term earnings, we\\'re confident in our ability to offset the impact with additional inflation-driven pricing actions. And overall, due to the strength of our brands and consistent approach to creating lasting connections with consumers, we are confident in the underlying health of the business and the many value creation opportunities ahead., Growth,\\nInflation, Pricing Actions, Share Gain, Value Creation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We hope to see you at our upcoming investor day on July 28 at the New York Stock Exchange, where the team and I will be sharing more on our plans for the future. We look forward to seeing many of you there in person. Now that I\\'ve highlighted our performance for the quarter, I\\'ll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail on our financials., Investor\\nDay, Future Plans, Financials, Performance, Team, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Sean. And good morning, everyone. I\\'ll start by reviewing our quarterly results at a summary level as shown here on Slide 28. As Sean discussed, we delivered strong organic net sales of plus 6% in Q3, reflecting the continued relevancy of our portfolio to consumers., Strong\\nPerformance, Organic Net Sales, Consumer Relevancy, Quarterly Results, Slide 28, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We experienced better-than-anticipated elasticities on volume in the face of our inflation-driven price increases. Inflation pressures accelerated as Q3 unfolded as reflected in our Q3 operating margin. At the same time, our Ardent Mills joint venture reflected in the equity earnings line had a strong quarter, driven by favorable market conditions. Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.58 was largely in line with our expectations, down 1.7% versus prior year and up 11.1% on a two-year compounded growth basis., Elasticities, Inflation, Operating Margin, Ardent Mills, Adjusted EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Overall, a very solid Q3 financial performance, given the volatile operating environment. We show a breakdown of our Q3 net sales bridge on Slide 29. Our 6% organic net sales growth was driven by a strong price mix increase of 8.6%, reflecting the inflation-driven pricing actions we have taken in every segment of our business over the last year. Volume declined 2.6%, primarily due to the elasticity impacts of the price increases, along with supply constraints on certain refrigerated and frozen products., Solid\\nFinancial Performance, Q3 Net Sales Bridge, Price Mix Increase, Volume Decline, Elasticity Impacts, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Looking at reported net sales drivers, the divestitures of our peanut butter and egg beaters businesses drove an 80 basis-point decline, and foreign exchange was an additional 10 basis-point headwind. Together, these factors contributed to 5.1% growth in total Conagra net sales for the quarter versus a year ago. Slide 30 shows our Q3 net sales summary by reporting segment on a one- and two-year basis. We delivered organic net sales growth across each of our segments this quarter due to inflation-driven pricing and continued strong consumer demand., Divestitures, Foreign Exchange, Net Sales Growth, Consumer Demand, Segment Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Growth was particularly strong within our foodservice segment, where volume continued to rebound as restaurant traffic recovers from the impact of COVID-19. Foodservice third quarter organic net sales were in line with pre-COVID sales levels. Within our two domestic retail businesses, both grocery and snacks, and refrigerated and frozen, delivered strong price mix results for the quarter. Volumes were down a bit more in refrigerated and frozen than in grocery and snacks as we had some higher-than-expected supply disruptions in refrigerated and frozen in the quarter associated with labor and materials challenges., Growth,\\nFoodservice, Volume, Retail Businesses, Supply Disruptions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, But we expect this dynamic to improve as we progress through Q4. For Total Conagra, organic net sales grew at a two-year compounded growth rate of 7.8% in the third quarter. We show the operating profit and margin summary of each of our reporting segments on Slide 31. Adjusted operating profit was down 9.9% in Q3 and was essentially flat on a two-year compounded basis., Q4\\nImprovement, Organic Net Sales Growth, Operating Profit, Margin Summary, Slide 31, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As you can see from our results, inflation and cost pressures were most concentrated in our refrigerated and frozen segment this quarter. I have a slide later in my remarks with specifics. But at a summary level, as Q3 unfolded, we began to experience higher-than-anticipated inflation on protein and higher cost in the temperature-controlled transportation network, both of which are harder to offset in the short term. But as you heard from Sean, our frozen businesses continue to win with consumers., Inflation, Cost Pressures, Refrigerated and Frozen Segment, Protein Prices, Temperature-Controlled\\nTransportation Network, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, While we look forward to getting back to a more normalized cost environment, we believe that our frozen portfolio is well-positioned to support the additional price increases that the current inflationary environment require. We\\'ve recently announced new pricing actions for our frozen businesses, as well as for our protein snacking businesses, which are also experiencing elevated levels of inflation. We will see the benefits of these new pricing actions in Q1 of fiscal year \\'23. Page 32 summarizes Total Conagra operating margin, excluding Ardent Mills for the third quarter., Frozen\\nPortfolio, Price Increases, Inflation, Cost Environment, Q1 Fiscal Year \\'23, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, This page really highlights the significant impact that inflation had on the business in the third quarter. Q3 total market inflation was 15.4% and negatively impacted operating margin by 10.6 percentage points in the quarter. This inflation level was higher than what we estimated when we discussed our outlook with you following Q2. And it\\'s driven the additional pricing actions I just mentioned., Inflation\\nImpact, Operating Margin, Pricing Actions, Q3 Total Market Inflation, Estimated Outlook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The good news is that our 8.6% increase in price mix in sales translated to 5.7 percentage points of operating margin improvement in the quarter. We also delivered 1.5 percentage points of productivity improvement, net of operational offsets, in the quarter. Our teams were able to deliver this level of net productivity even in the face of meaningful labor disruption. The level of base productivity we achieved in our plants and our production output were both challenged in Q3 due to omicron-related labor disruption., Price\\nMix, Operating Margin Improvement, Productivity Improvement, Labor Disruption, Base Productivity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, But with the labor situation now starting to stabilize, we expect these headwinds to abate as we progress through Q4. We also saw marginal benefits from A&P and adjusted SG&A savings in Q3. These factors combined to deliver adjusted operating margin of 13.7% for the third quarter. Turning to Slide 33, you can see our adjusted EPS bridge for the quarter., Labor\\nSituation, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted EPS Bridge, Slide 33, Q4 Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The operating profit drivers I just discussed resulted in a $0.06 decrease in adjusted EPS versus Q3 of last year. The primary operating profit headwind was the 15.4% inflation rate. The other major headwind in Q3 was the unfavorable operating efficiencies related to labor disruptions in our operations that I just mentioned. The tailwinds for the quarter were the significant price mix benefits and realized productivity that we delivered., Inflation\\nRate, Operating Profit Headwinds, Labor Disruptions, Price Mix Benefits, Realized Productivity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We also had lower SG&A and A&P costs in the quarter. Q3 EPS was also favorably impacted by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt and by a very strong quarter from Ardent Mills. Given the nature of Ardent\\'s business, it can benefit from volatile market conditions. Although Ardent income is recorded below operating margin in our financial statements, it is a cash-generating business that has performed well in this highly inflationary environment., Lower\\nSG&A and A&P Costs, Q3 EPS, Weighted Average Interest Rate, Ardent Mills Performance, Cash-\\nGenerating Business, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As you\\'ve seen in our materials this morning, the highly inflationary environment has caused us to reduce our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. However, we believe it\\'s important to provide some additional details on how we view the underlying earnings power of our portfolio, which we believe is strong. On a pro forma basis, we estimate that fiscal \\'22 adjusted EPS approximate $2.65 versus the updated guidance of $2.35 we\\'re sharing today. So, what does that $2.65 represent? First, as you can see on the chart, it incorporates the impact of the updated market inflation estimate we\\'re now expecting in Q4, driving a reduction in our previous EPS estimate of about $0.18., Underlying Earning Power, Fiscal \\'22 Adjusted EPS, Market Inflation Estimate, Q4 Performance, Pro\\nForma Basis, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The $2.65 also reflects estimated favorability of approximately $0.03 versus the previous full year EPS estimate for Ardent Mills. Beyond those items, the $2.65 reflects our estimate of all the pricing lags we faced this fiscal year. As you\\'ve heard us discuss in recent quarters, the reality of a CPG food business is that inflation hits the P&L before a corresponding pricing response can be executed with customers. Generally, that lag is about 90 days., Ardent\\nMills EPS Estimate, Pricing Lags, Fiscal Year EPS, Q4 Performance, CPG Food Business, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We\\'ve estimated the impact of our pricing lags net of elasticities for fiscal year \\'22. We believe that the full year impact of these lags is approximately $0.30. This estimated impact excludes our foodservice and international segments, as we only quantified it for the domestic retail businesses. Of course, it\\'s important to understand what this estimate represents., Pricing\\nLags Estimate, Fiscal Year \\'22 Impact, Domestic Retail Businesses, Foodservice Segment,\\nInternational Segment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, It is not our fiscal year \\'23 EPS guidance. We will provide more insight on our expectations for fiscal \\'23 after fiscal year \\'22 ends. But it is our estimate of what adjusted EPS might have been in fiscal \\'22 if price increases were effective at the same time that inflation actually hit our P&L, better demonstrating the underlying earnings power of the business. Slide 35 breaks down our revised inflation expectations a bit further., Fiscal\\n\\'22 EPS Estimate, Price Increases, Underlying Earning Power, Inflation Expectations, Slide 35, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As you can see, the expected inflation rate for Q4 is the biggest delta compared to our previous expectations. If you look at the chart on the right, Q4 inflation is expected to be approximately 26% versus two years ago. Clearly, an unprecedented level of market inflation that we are managing through. Slide 36 goes into more detail on where we saw this inflation impact on our supply chain most severely in the third quarter and where the bulk of the incremental 100 million of new inflation is coming from., Q4\\nInflation Rate, Supply Chain Impact, Slide 36, Market Inflation, Managing Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As Sean and I have both mentioned, transportation and proteins were particularly challenging in Q3, and remained so as we started Q4. Dairy has also been a headwind versus our prior expectations. Let\\'s talk a bit more about each of these. Beginning with transportation, Q3 costs were heavily impacted by driver and truck availability, which resulted in more inflationary pressures from spot market usage and rates., Transportation Costs, Driver Availability, Truck Availability, Dairy Headwind, Q4 Impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Additionally, as you are all aware, fuel prices were driven up significantly during the quarter due to unforeseen worldwide events. With respect to proteins and dairy, we also saw Q3 inflation at rates higher than previously forecasted. Meat-based proteins are difficult to hedge, and current industry freezer inventory positions are at multi-year lows. This supply dynamic limits our ability to build our freezer stock inventory, which is our typical coverage strategy., Fuel\\nPrices, Unforeseen Worldwide Events, Protein Inflation, Dairy Inflation, Meat-Based Proteins, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, For a bit more perspective on cost, our total meat-based protein spend in fiscal \\'21 approximated $675 million. For fiscal \\'22, we now estimate total meat-based protein market inflation of approximately 50%, which is approximately $340 million of additional market cost in this one commodity area, driving nearly 40% of our total gross materials inflation in fiscal \\'22. In summary, these three categories alone are estimated to drive $0.16 of the incremental gross cost inflation we\\'re now expecting for Q4. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, we stayed the course on our balanced capital allocation approach this quarter., Meat-\\nBased Protein Inflation, Total Spend in Fiscal \\'21, Total Meat-Based Protein Market Inflation, Gross\\nMaterials Inflation, Balanced Capital Allocation Approach, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As outlined on Slide 37, we reduced net debt by approximately $240 million in Q3, getting our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 4.2 times. As more of our pricing actions flow through our balance sheet in the fourth quarter, we expect this leverage ratio to drop to approximately 3.9 times. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and to our long-term net leverage target of roughly 3.5 times. I\\'ll wrap up with a repeat of the updated guidance that Sean walked you through., Net Debt\\nReduction, Net Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio, Q4 Impact, Credit Rating, Updated Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Our new fiscal \\'22 and Q4 guidance are shown on Slide 38. As you\\'ve heard from us this morning, we expect our strong top-line momentum to continue with benefits from our pricing actions and favorable elasticities, driving organic net sales growth of approximately 7% in Q4 and approximately 4% for the full year, up from approximately 3% in our previous guidance and up from approximately flat in our original fiscal \\'22 guidance. Because of the incremental inflation we have discussed today and the additional lag in the pricing actions, we are estimating Q4 EPS to approximate $0.64, a strong increase of 18.5% versus the prior year. This results in EPS for fiscal year \\'22 of approximately $2.35, down from approximately $2.50., Q4\\nGuidance, Top-Line Momentum, Organic Net Sales Growth, EPS Growth, Fiscal Year \\'22 Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We also now expect market inflation for the year to approximate 16%, up from approximately 14%. And we expect adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15.5% in Q4 and approximately 14.5% for the full year. We remain confident in the brand strength and underlying earnings power of our business. Following the Conagra Way playbook, we continue to invest in our brands to create innovative products that resonate with consumers, and we believe these investments have positioned our portfolio well to manage through this challenging environment., Market\\nInflation, Adjusted Operating Margin, Brand Strength, Investments in Brands, Conagra Way Playbook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We look forward to diving deeper into the progress we have made and the future opportunities we see at our upcoming investor day scheduled for July 28th in New York City. You will also hear from our new supply chain leader, Ale Eboli, who will review the strategic actions we are planning to drive further efficiencies in our supply chain. We will also communicate our algorithm for longer-term financial performance. We look forward to seeing many of you then., Investor\\nDay, Supply Chain Strategies, Financial Performance, Ale Eboli, Long-Term Financial Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you for listening, everyone. That concludes my prepared remarks today. I\\'ll now hand it back to the operator for questions., Thanking\\nListeners, Conclusion of Remarks, Handing Back to Operator, Questions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our results for the quarter, our updated outlook for the remainder of the year and why we believe that Conagra continues to be well positioned for the future. I\\'d like to start by giving you some context for the quarter., Context\\nfor Quarter, Discussion of Results, Updated Outlook, Belief in Company\\'s Positioning, Future\\nProspects, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, First, as you all know, the external environment has continued to be highly dynamic. But our team remained extremely agile in the quarter and executed the Conagra Way playbook. We navigated the ongoing complexity and delivered strong net sales growth anchored in elevated consumer demand that continued to exceed our ability to supply, inflation-driven pricing actions and lower-than-expected elasticities. While our net sales exceeded our expectations, margin pressure in the second quarter was also higher than expected driven by three key factors., External\\nEnvironment, Agility of Team, Net Sales Growth, Margin Pressure, Key Factors, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, First, while we anticipated elevated inflation during the second quarter, it was higher than our forecast. Second, we experienced some additional transitory supply chain costs related to the current environment. And third, in the face of elevated consumer demand that continue to outpace our ability to supply, we elected to make investments to service orders and maximize product availability for our consumers. We expect margins to improve in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the levers we pulled and continue to pull to manage the impact of inflation., Anticipated Inflation, Transitory Supply Chain Costs, Investments in Service Orders, Elevated\\nConsumer Demand, Expected Improvement in Margins, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll always look to our cost savings programs to offset input cost inflation. However, given the magnitude of the cost increases, our actions also include additional inflation-driven pricing. We communicated pricing to customers again in December. For the year, we\\'re once again reaffirming our adjusted EPS outlook, but our path to achieve that guidance has evolved., Cost\\nSavings Programs, Inflation-Driven Pricing, Communication with Customers, Adjusted EPS Outlook,\\nEvolution of Guidance Path, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re increasing our organic net sales guidance based on stronger-than-expected consumer demand and lower-than-anticipated elasticities. We\\'re also updating our margin guidance given the increase in our gross inflation expectations for the year and the timing of the related pricing actions. Taken together, we continue to believe that elevated consumer demand, coupled with additional pricing and cost savings actions, will enable us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of about $2.50. So with that as the backdrop, let\\'s jump into the agenda for today\\'s call., Stronger-\\nThan-Expected Consumer Demand, Lower-Than-Anticipated Elasticities, Update on Margin Guidance,\\nElevated Consumer Demand and Additional Actions, Adjusted Diluted EPS Outlook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll start with an overview of the quarter before going into more detail on our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year. I\\'ll also share some of our thoughts on the structural changes we\\'re seeing in consumer behavior, particularly with younger consumers. We believe these changes are further evidenced in the long-term potential of Conagra Brands. Let\\'s dig into the quarter., Overview\\nof Quarter, Outlook for Second Half of Fiscal Year, Thoughts on Consumer Behavior, Long-Term\\nPotential of Conagra Brands, Digging into the Quarter, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 7, our team delivered solid Q2 results. On a two-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the second quarter increased by more than 5% and adjusted EPS grew by nearly 1%. As I noted earlier, we delivered these results in the face of a highly dynamic and challenging operating environment. Input cost inflation came in higher than expected in the quarter., Solid Q2\\nResults, Increased Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EPS Growth, Highly Dynamic Operating Environment,\\nInput Cost Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In addition, we made some strategic decisions to service the heightened consumer demand we continue to experience. As the entire industry incurred transitory costs associated with labor shortages, supply issues on material and transportation costs and congestion challenges during our Q2, we chose to invest in our supply chain and service orders. This deliberate decision ensured we could deliver food to our customers and consumers especially during the holiday season. Maintaining physical availability is an important part of building trust with customers and maintaining consumer loyalty., Strategic\\nDecisions, Consumer Demand, Transitory Costs, Supply Chain Investments, Physical Availability and\\nTrust Building, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The bottom line is that amid the supply disruption seen across the industry, we remain focused on building for the long term. While the net result of these factors was a negative impact on our margins during the quarter, we\\'re confident that our purposeful approach better positions our portfolio for the future. I want to take this opportunity to thank our tremendous supply chain team. They\\'ve been resilient in navigating this environment, allowing us to remain agile and deliver for our customers and consumers., Long-Term\\nFocus, Supply Disruption, Negative Impact on Margins, Purposeful Approach, Resilient Supply Chain\\nTeam, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, I continue to be impressed by our team\\'s commitment and I\\'m grateful for their ongoing dedication. Looking at Slide 10. You can see that our strong performance in the second quarter was broad based. Total Conagra retail sales were up 14.8% on a two-year basis in the quarter, with double-digit growth in each of our domestic retail domains frozen, snacks and staples., Strong\\nPerformance, Broad-Based Growth, Total Conagra Retail Sales, Double-Digit Growth in Each Domain,\\nOngoing Dedication, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Household penetration was also up this quarter, building upon the significant number of new consumers we\\'ve acquired over the past two years. Total Conagra household penetration was up 59 basis points on a two-year basis and our category share increased 41 basis points. In addition to increasing household penetration and acquiring new consumers, we are retaining our existing consumers, as demonstrated by our repeat rates. Shoppers continue to discover our incredible products and their tremendous value proposition., Household\\nPenetration, New Consumers Acquired, Category Share Increase, Repeat Rates, Product Discovery, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As the chart on the right of Slide 11 shows, our consumers keep coming back for more. As we execute our Conagra Way playbook, innovation remained a key to our success across the portfolio in Q2. Slide 12 highlights the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new product and modernizing our portfolio. During the second quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year ago period., Innovation, Consumer Loyalty, Conagra Way Playbook, Disciplined Approach, New Product Development, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to invest in new product quality and it\\'s supporting our innovation launches with deeper, more meaningful consumer connections. Once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including snacks, sweet treats, sauces and marinades and frozen vegetables. Slide 13 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce continued to yield strong results. We again delivered strong quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business and e-commerce accounted for a larger percentage of our overall retail sales than our peers., Investment in New Product Quality, Consumer Connections, Innovation Launches, E-Commerce Growth,\\nPeer Comparison, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the second quarter, just as we did in the first quarter of 2022 and throughout fiscal 2021. As we mentioned earlier, our strong net sales growth was driven by elevated consumer demand, favorable elasticities and inflation-driven pricing actions. On Slide 14, you can see the extent of our pricing actions in the first half of the fiscal year. During this period, our on-shelf prices rose across all three domestic retail domains., E-commerce sales growth, Consumer demand, Pricing actions, Inflation, Elasticities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And, as Dave will discuss shortly, the pricing flowed through the P&L. As you can see on Slide 15, price elasticity has been fairly low. It\\'s been favorable to our expectations. Consumers continued to see the tremendous value of our products relative to other food options, a concept I will elaborate on in a few minutes., Consumer\\nperception, Product value, Pricing elasticity, Sales growth, Profitability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now, let\\'s turn to the path ahead. You can see on Slide 17 we currently expect gross inflation to be approximately 14% for fiscal 2022 compared to the approximately 11% we anticipated at the time of our first quarter call. This is a large increase and we\\'re taking actions to offset the increase while still investing in the long-term health of our business. To help manage our increasing inflation, we\\'re taking incremental pricing actions, including list price increases and modified merchandising plans., Inflation, Pricing actions, Sales growth, Gross inflation, Business investment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Many of these actions have already been announced to our customers. As a reminder, there is a lag in timing between the impact of inflation and our ability to execute pricing adjustments based on that inflation. As a result, the incremental price increases will go into effect in the second half of the year with the most significant impact during the fourth quarter. While it\\'s easy to get caught up in the quarter-to-quarter impact of inflation and pricing, it\\'s important to keep focused on the big picture., Inflation, Pricing actions, Sales growth, Timing, Focus, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The long-term success of our business is driven by how consumers, particularly younger consumers, respond to our products. And when you take a step back to evaluate the broader environment and how our portfolio delivers against the needs of the modern consumer, we believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned for the future. As we\\'ve detailed many times before, Conagra\\'s on-trend portfolio filled with modern food attributes is winning with younger consumers. And our confidence is underpinned by the many changes we\\'re seeing in consumer behavior that are proving to be structural, especially given that these changes are driven by younger consumers that represent the most significant opportunity for long-term value creation., Consumer\\nbehavior, Modern food attributes, Structural changes, Long-term value creation, Younger consumers, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Younger consumers represent a large and growing part of the U.S. population and they want to optimize the value that they get for the money they spend on food. A large part of optimizing their food spending includes shifting more dollars from eating away from home to eating at home. As they make that trade, they\\'re choosing national brands., Younger\\nconsumers, Food spending, Optimization, National brands, Eating habits, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And we believe Conagra is ideally positioned to experience an outsized benefit from these behaviors given the relationship our brands are forming with younger consumers. Overall, Conagra is delivering superior relative value to consumers compared to both away-from-home options and store brands. Let\\'s take a closer look at these trends, starting with the population changes. Slide 20 highlights the demographic shift underway in the U.S., Demographic shift, Population changes, Consumer behavior, Brand formation, Value creation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Millennial and Gen Z consumers are a large and growing cohort. These consumers are starting to settle down, buy homes and start families. As we presented in the past, when people enter the family formation phase, they increase the amount of food they eat at home with an outsized increase in the consumption of frozen foods. And what we find particularly important about reaching Millennial and Gen Z consumers is that we believe they will remain more value focused than their predecessors., Millennials, Gen Z, Family formation, Food consumption, Value focus, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, First, let\\'s talk about the near term. As you can see in the chart on the left, Millennial and Gen Z consumers are earlier in their careers and earning less than the older generations of working-age people. This is natural, but it bodes well for food-at-home trends in the shorter term. We believe that even as foodservice bounces back, younger consumers will be value conscious in their food choices., Younger\\ngenerations, Career development, Earning potential, Food-at-home trends, Value consciousness, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Fewer younger consumers are expected to achieve the financial success of the generations before them. The data on the right suggests that Millennials are more likely to earn less than their parents. We believe this means that these savvy consumers will look to stretch their food dollars further even as they age. The data also shows that younger consumers are already eating more at home., Younger\\nconsumers, Financial success, Food spending, Eating habits, Stretching food dollars, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Compared to the population as a whole, Gen Z and Millennials have decreased restaurant visits more and sourced a larger percentage of their meals at home. As these younger consumers have made the shift to at-home eating, the data shows that they\\'re finding comfort in the quality, reliability and familiarity that national brands provide. We believe this makes a lot of sense. National brands provide value while replicating many of the on-trend flavors and modern food attributes that consumers are used to experiencing in away-from-home dining., Younger\\nconsumers, Eating habits, National brands, Value, Familiarity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, When consumers make trades like away-from-home to in-home eating, trust is paramount. In short, national brands, particularly modernized brands like those in our portfolio, deliver on this trust imperative and that\\'s because they offer superior relative value versus other food options. As consumers seek to stretch their household balance sheets in the face of broad-based inflation, one of the single largest levers available to them is the reduction in spending on food away from home as food-away-from-home prices are typically over three and a half times more expensive than food-at-home prices. This trade will likely become even more important for consumers as food-away-from-home prices have already increased faster than at-home prices in calendar 2021 and they are expected to increase at nearly twice the rate as at-home prices in calendar year 2022., Trust,\\nInflation, Food spending, Value, Portfolio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our aggressive modernization of the Conagra portfolio over the past several years has put us in a strong position to capitalize on these structural shifts. Our portfolio has shown its competitive advantage with excellent trial, depth of repeat and share gain performance. Overall, we believe Conagra is well positioned to leverage these shifts to create meaningful value for shareholders. And Slide 25 shows you the data to support our claim., Modernization, Portfolio, Competitive advantage, Value creation, Shareholder value, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Conagra is attracting more younger consumers than our peers and getting them to repeat at more attractive rates. By appealing to younger consumers now, we\\'re building superior consumer lifetime value. Importantly, the data shows that these new, younger buyers are stickier across our portfolio. We believe this comes back to the investments we\\'ve made and continue to make in our products and our brands., Younger\\nconsumers, Attractiveness, Lifetime value, Brand investment, Stickiness, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The Conagra Way has positioned us to win. As I discussed earlier, we\\'re reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $2.50 for the full year with a few updates on how we expect to get there. We\\'re increasing our organic net sales guidance to be approximately plus 3%, up from approximately 1%. We\\'re slightly adjusting our adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 15 and a half percent, down from approximately 16%., Conagra\\nWay, EPS guidance, Organic net sales, Adjusted operating margin, Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And we\\'re updating our gross inflation guidance to about 14%, up from approximately 11%. Now that I\\'ve highlighted our performance for the quarter and strong positioning for the future, I\\'ll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail on our financial performance., Gross\\ninflation guidance, Financial performance, Quarterly performance, Positioning for the future,\\nUpdate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Sean and good morning, everybody. I\\'ll start by going over some highlights from the quarter shown on Slide 28. As Sean mentioned earlier, there were a number of factors that influenced our results this quarter. First, we were encouraged to see that consumer demand for our products remain strong., Consumer\\ndemand, Quarterly highlights, Slide 28, Influencing factors, Financial performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, And second, elasticities were better than anticipated. However, we also continued to see inflation rise across a number of key inputs and the dynamic macro environment created challenging conditions for the supply chain. The team remained agile in response to these dynamics, including the decision to make additional investments during the quarter to meet the elevated demand and maximize the food supply to our consumers. Overall, our actions favorably impacted our top line during the quarter with organic net sales up 2.6% compared to the year ago period., Consumer\\ndemand, Elasticities, Inflation, Supply chain, Top line, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, An important part of the top line success we\\'ve realized throughout the pandemic is our ongoing commitment to the Conagra Way. We\\'ve remained focused on building and maintaining strong brands across the portfolio. We continued these efforts in the second quarter with continued product innovation and by further increasing our spending on advertising and promotion, primarily focusing on e-commerce investments. We show a breakdown of our net sales on Slide 29., Ongoing\\ncommitment, Building strong brands, Product innovation, Advertising and promotion, Net sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The 4.2% decline in volume was primarily due to the lapping of the prior-year surge in demand during an earlier stage in the COVID-19 pandemic as volume increased approximately 1% on a two-year CAGR. The second quarter volume decline was more than offset by the very favorable impact of brand mix and inflation-driven pricing actions we realized this quarter, driving an overall organic net sales growth of 2.6%. On last quarter\\'s call, we noted that the domestic retail pricing actions were just starting to be reflected on shelves at the end of the first quarter. Those increases were reflected in our P&L this quarter, driving the 6.8% increase in price mix., Volume\\ndecline, Brand mix, Inflation-driven pricing actions, Organic net sales growth, Price mix, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The divestitures of our H.K. Anderson business, the Peter Pan peanut butter business and the Egg Beaters business resulted in a 70-basis-point decline and foreign exchange drove a 20-basis-point benefit. Together, all these factors contributed to a 2.1% increase in total Conagra net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago. Slide 30 shows our net sales summary by segment both on a year-over-year and on a two-year compounded basis., Divestitures, Foreign exchange, Net sales growth, Segment net sales, Slide 30, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As you can see, we continue to deliver strong two-year compounded net sales growth in each of our three retail segments, which resulted in a two-year compounded organic net sales growth of 5.3% for the total company. You can see the puts and takes of our operating margin on Slide 31. We drove a 6.2 percentage point benefit from improved price mix, supply chain-realized productivity, cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition and lower pandemic-related expenses. Netted within the 6.2% are the additional investments we made to service orders and maximize product availability., Strong\\nnet sales growth, Two-year compounded organic net sales growth, Operating margin, Price mix, Cost\\nsynergies, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, These investments reflect the dynamic environment and actions we\\'ve taken to respond to it. This includes decisions to utilize more third-party transportation and warehousing vendors for some of our frozen products, incurring incremental cost to move product around our distribution network to better align with customer order patterns and delaying a plant consolidation productivity program to maximize current production. The 6.2% also includes transitory supply chain costs such as higher inventory write-offs and increased overtime to support operations. The 6.2 percentage point benefit was more than offset by an inflation headwind of 11 percentage points., Investments, Dynamic environment, Customer order patterns, Supply chain costs, Inflation headwind, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The second quarter gross inflation rate of 16.4% of cost of goods sold was approximately 100 basis points or $20 million higher than expected, driven by higher-than-anticipated increases in proteins and transportation, which are both difficult to hedge. The combination of the favorable margin levers, our choiceful supply chain investments and inflation headwinds resulted in adjusted gross margin declining by 483 basis points. Our operating margin was further impacted by 20 basis points due to our increased A&P investment during the quarter, as I mentioned earlier. You can see how these elevated costs impacted each of our reporting segments on Slide 32., Gross\\ninflation rate, Cost of goods sold, Adjusted gross margin, Operating margin, A&P investment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, While each segment was impacted, our Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted the most with adjusted operating margin down 707 basis points primarily due to outsized materials inflation and the additional investment incurred to service orders and get food delivered to consumers. We are confident that we will improve overall operating margins in the second half as we execute our additional pricing actions to offset the higher inflation rates. As you can see on Slide 33, our second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.64 was heavily impacted by the input cost inflation across our portfolio. Even though the benefits of our first quarter pricing flowed through the P&L this quarter, the incremental inflation we incurred in the second quarter created an additional headwind., Refrigerated & Frozen segment, Adjusted operating margin, Materials inflation, Additional\\ninvestment, Adjusted EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, In response, we announced additional pricing to customers in early Q3 during December. Although we have yet another lag before this pricing benefits the P&L, we expect to realize benefits from these pricing actions in late Q3 with most of the impact in Q4. Also, our Ardent Mills joint venture had another good quarter and delivered EPS benefit versus the prior year. We realized lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count due to our share repurchases in prior quarters., Additional pricing, P&L impact, Ardent Mills joint venture, Net interest expense, Share\\nrepurchases, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Slide 34. I want to unpack how Q2 adjusted EPS landed versus our expectations. Our second quarter adjusted EPS came in lower than we originally had anticipated due to two main factors. First, as previously mentioned, inflation came in higher by approximately 100 basis points of cost of goods sold or approximately $0.02 to $0.03 of EPS., Inflation, Adjusted EPS, Original expectations, Cost of goods sold, Main factors, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, While we have announced additional pricing actions for the second half to offset the incremental inflation, the timing of these benefits is naturally lagging behind the higher inflation. Second, the cost we elected to incur to service orders, coupled with the additional transitory supply chain costs I described earlier, led to another $0.02 to $0.03 impact on our adjusted EPS. We are forecasting these service and transitory cost dynamics to improve as the second half progresses. Looking at Slide 35, we ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.3x, which is in line with the seasonal increase in leverage expected for the second quarter., Additional pricing actions, Incremental inflation, Transitory supply chain costs, Adjusted EPS\\nimpact, Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We expect to generate strong free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year and expect to end the year with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.7 to 3.8 times. We remain committed to a longer-term net leverage target of approximately 3.5 times and to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. I want to close today by reviewing the factors driving the updated guidance we issued this morning, which is shown here on Slide 36. I\\'ll start by saying that we remain confident in our ability to achieve approximately $2.50 in adjusted EPS for the full fiscal year., Strong\\nfree cash flow, Net leverage ratio, Investment-grade credit rating, Updated guidance, Adjusted EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As the macro environment continues to be very dynamic, our expectations for the path to achieve that target have shifted. We are increasing our organic net sales growth guidance to approximately 3% to reflect our stronger-than-expected performance year-to-date as well as our incremental pricing actions in the second half. We are lowering our adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 15 and a half percent. We expect the incremental sales and pricing actions in the second half to offset the dollar impact of the incremental net inflation and other supply chain costs., Organic\\nnet sales growth, Adjusted operating margin, Incremental pricing actions, Net inflation, Supply\\nchain costs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We have increased our gross inflation expectations to approximately 14%, largely driven by higher estimated costs versus the previous estimate for proteins, transportation, dairy and resin. We will continue to monitor these input costs closely and will be quick to respond using all available margin levers. As Sean detailed, price elasticity has been favorable to our expectations so far. As we have explained previously, there is a lag in timing between when we experience inflation, take actions, including pricing, to offset the dollar impact of the inflation and when we see those actions flow through our financial results., Gross\\ninflation expectations, Input costs, Price elasticity, Timing of actions, Financial results, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, With respect to the additional pricing actions we have announced for the second half of fiscal \\'22, we expect to realize a small amount late in the third quarter and the full benefits from these price increases in the fourth quarter. We therefore expect our third quarter margins to be roughly in line with second quarter margins with an increase in operating margins in Q4 as the pricing catches up with inflation and the impact of the lag is reduced. Our guidance also assumes that the end-to-end supply chain will continue to operate effectively as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Before turning it over to the operator for Q&A, I would like to reiterate that confidence in our ability to reach our earnings goal is based on the strength of our business at its core to manufacture and deliver foods that people enjoy., Additional pricing actions, Operating margins, Supply chain, COVID-19 pandemic, Business strength, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 2, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, That concludes my prepared remarks today. Thank you for listening. I\\'ll now hand it back to the operator for questions., Business\\nstrength, COVID-19 pandemic, Operating margins, Supply chain, Earnings goal, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our results for the quarter, our updated outlook for the remainder of the year and why we believe that Conagra continues to be well-positioned for the future. Slide 5 lays out our key messages for today., First-\\nquarter fiscal 2022 earnings, Updated outlook, Company positioning, Key messages, Slide 5, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, First, as everyone is aware, the external environment is incredibly dynamic right now, and we see many of these challenges persisting. But despite the complex operating situation, the ongoing dedication, resilience and agility of our team enabled us to deliver solid Q1 results on the back of strong sales. We continue to benefit from our proven approach to brand building and the breadth of investments we\\'re making to increase consumer demand. These efforts drive brand health, which is evidenced by the continued strength of our sales, share and repeat rates across the portfolio., External\\nenvironment, Operating situation, Brand building, Consumer demand, Sales performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As a result, we believe our brands are well-positioned to continue managing through the current inflationary challenges and support ongoing inflation-justified pricing actions. Looking ahead, we\\'re reaffirming our EPS outlook for the year. However, we now see a slightly different path to achieving that EPS. We expect inflation to be higher than originally forecasted but we also see continued strength in consumer demand even above our original expectations., Inflation-justified pricing actions, EPS outlook, Consumer demand, Inflation forecast, Brand\\npositioning, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We believe that consumer demand, coupled with additional pricing and cost-saving actions, will enable us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of about $2.50. So with that as the backdrop, let\\'s jump right in. We know that our long-term performance is a function of the caliber and engagement of our team, and that has never been more true than today. I\\'m extremely proud of the team\\'s resilience and agility in adapting to the dynamic environment we\\'re currently experiencing., Consumer\\ndemand, Pricing actions, Cost-saving actions, Team performance, Dynamic environment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As a result of our team\\'s continued hard work and dedication, we\\'ve been able to successfully execute through sustained elevated demand and challenging supply conditions. First, as we\\'ve already mentioned, consumer demand has remained at higher levels than we expected due to macro forces, as well as the unique position of our portfolio. This is a great problem to have, but it increases the demands on our supply chain at a time when the industry is navigating labor shortages, material supply issues and transportation cost and congestion challenges. Taken together, these factors created an upper control limit on the amount of product we could produce and ship in Q1., Consumer\\ndemand, Supply chain challenges, Labor shortages, Material supply issues, Transportation cost and\\ncongestion, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, If we had the capacity to meet all of the demand, our numbers would likely have been even more impressive. However, our ability to deliver solid results amid this dynamic environment is a testament to our team\\'s ongoing commitment to executing the Conagra Way playbook each and every day. The Conagra Way playbook to portfolio modernization remains our North Star in any operating environment. Regardless of the external factors that may influence short-term demand and supply dynamics in any given quarter, we define long-term success as creating meaningful and lasting connections between consumers and our brands., Dynamic\\nenvironment, Team commitment, Conagra Way playbook, Portfolio modernization, Consumer connections, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We believe that our playbook is the most effective framework for delivering on that objective. Those of you who have followed us for a while will recall that our modern approach to brand building is more comprehensive than legacy industry practices. Instead of anchoring our brand building predominantly in broadcast advertising that pushes new messages on old products, we anchor our investments and our efforts first in developing new modern and superior items. Then once we\\'ve created these more modern and provocative products, we invest to drive the physical availability of those items in-store and online., Brand\\nbuilding, Modern approach, Investments, Product development, Availability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And finally, our investments to drive meaningful one-to-one communication to the right consumers at the right time, at the right place, enable us to remain salient and relevant. This comprehensive approach and unwavering commitment to modernizing and premiumizing our portfolio continues to pay off and enables us to better manage our brands within any environment. And as you can see on Slide 8, our team delivered solid results during the first quarter. As you know, our year-over-year growth rates were impacted by the elevated demand we experienced during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 when we were still in the early months of the pandemic., Investments, Communication, Portfolio modernization, Growth rates, Team performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Given this dynamic, we\\'ll reference some two-year figures throughout today\\'s presentation to provide more helpful context of what we believe is the underlying strength and trajectory of the business. As you can see, on a two-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the first quarter increased 7% and adjusted EPS grew by nearly 8%. Importantly, our solid performance in the first quarter was broad-based. Just take a look at Slide 9., Two-year\\nfigures, Business strength, Organic net sales, Adjusted EPS, Broad-based performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Total Conagra weighted dollar share grew 0.8 points on a two-year basis in the quarter with share gains in each of our domestic retail domains: frozen, snacks and staples. Innovation remained a key to our success across the portfolio in Q1. Slide 10 highlights the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and modernizing our portfolio. During the first quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year-ago period., Innovation, Share gains, Portfolio modernization, Disciplined approach, Two-year basis, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, This reflects not only the quality of the products launched, but also our efforts to support those launches with investments and capabilities that deliver deeper, more meaningful consumer connections. And as you can see, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including snacks, sweet treats, frozen vegetables and frozen meals. Our performance is a clear testament to the innovation and marketing engine at Conagra, and we believe the solid reputation we\\'ve built with customers and consumers. In addition to developing superior products, we also remain focused on physical availability during the first quarter through both brick-and-mortar and online., Innovation, Consumer connections, Product quality, Physical availability, Brand reputation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 11 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce continued to yield strong results. Once again, we delivered quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business, both against our peers and as a percentage of our overall retail sales. We outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the first quarter, just as we did throughout fiscal 2021. E-commerce sales now represent more than 9% of our total retail sales, more than double what they were just two years ago., Investments, Growth, E-commerce sales, Retail sales, Double, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we mentioned earlier, our solid top-line performance during the first quarter was driven by strong demand, robust brand-building investments and inflation-justified pricing actions. Slide 12 details the extent of our pricing actions to date. A few key points to keep in mind. First, we began implementing actions on some of our domestic retail products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to the inflation we began to experience last fiscal year., Inflation, Pricing actions, Brand-building investments, Top-line performance, Demand, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The majority of our domestic retail pricing actions, however, just started to hit the market at the end of Q1 in response to the inflation we spoke to you about on our Q4 earnings call in July. As a result, the benefit in the quarter is less than what we expect to see going forward. You can see this playing out in the consumption data from the last four weeks, all of which are part of our fiscal second quarter. During this period, our on-shelf prices rose across all three domestic retail domains., Inflation, Pricing actions, Consumption data, On-shelf prices, Fiscal second quarter, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Looking ahead, our original plans for the year included additional inflation-justified pricing in future periods. Given the heightened inflationary environment, however, we now expect to take incremental actions beyond those original plans. Many of these actions have already been communicated to our customers and the benefits will be weighted toward the second half of the fiscal year. We\\'ll keep you apprised, but it\\'s important that we stress that our pricing actions are not a blunt instrument., Inflation, Pricing actions, Original plans, Additional actions, Second half of fiscal year, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We take a fact-based approach to pricing within the portfolio. We use a data-driven approach to elasticities and thoughtfully execute actions to align with customer windows. As we look ahead, we remain confident in the fiscal 2022 EPS guidance we outlined on the fourth-quarter call, but we now expect to take a different path to achieving that guidance. As mentioned, we now expect inflation to be higher than originally forecasted., Pricing\\napproach, Data-driven approach, Elasticities, Fiscal 2022 EPS guidance, Inflation forecast, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, However, we believe that the combination of continued strength in consumer demand, incremental inflation-justified pricing and additional cost savings actions will enable us to offset the impact of that inflation. I\\'d like to briefly unpack these factors, starting with the update to our inflation expectations. As you can see on Slide 14, we currently expect gross inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal 2022, compared to the approximately 9% we anticipated at the time of our fourth-quarter call. The bulk of the incremental inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of proteins, edible fats and oils, grains and steel cans since our Q4 call., Inflation expectations, Consumer demand, Cost savings actions, Gross inflation, Protein costs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, I want to emphasize that this is our best current estimate of gross inflation for the full year and does not account for the impact of supply chain productivity improvements or hedging. Dave will provide more color on inflation and the various levers we\\'re able to pull to help offset its impact. Even in the face of this acutely inflationary environment, we remain squarely focused on continuing to invest in our brands and capturing the strong consumer demand. And we\\'re pleased to share that the consumer demand we experienced during the first quarter exceeded our prior expectations., Inflation, Supply\\nChain, Investment, Consumer Demand, Gross Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 15, our total company retail sales on a two-year CAGR basis were up nearly 7% in the first quarter with strong growth across our frozen, snacks and staples domains. And when you peel back the onion further you find even more evidence to underscore the durable strength of our top-line performance. The chart on the left side of Slide 16 demonstrates that we continue to grow our household penetration during the first quarter, building upon the significant new consumer acquisition we\\'ve achieved over the past year and a half. But what I believe is even more encouraging is the chart on the right., Retail Sales,\\nGrowth, Household Penetration, Consumer Acquisition, New Consumer, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We didn\\'t just acquire new consumers, we kept them. The data shows growth in repeat rates that demonstrates our new consumers discovered the incredible products and tremendous value proposition of our portfolio. We\\'re proud that our products are resonating with consumers and that those shoppers keep coming back for more. Importantly, our performance on these metrics, household penetration and repeat rates has not only been strong in the absolute but relative to the competition as well., Growth, Consumers,\\nRepeat Rates, Household Penetration, Competition, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also encouraged by the elasticity of demand for our portfolio, which has been better than previously expected. Slide 17 demonstrates that our pricing actions to date have had limited impact on demand. As I mentioned, most of our pricing actions taken to date began to appear on shelf at the end of Q1. And you can see how that dynamic is being reflected in the data for September, which is part of our second quarter., Demand, Pricing\\nActions, Elasticity, Q1, September, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to be cautiously optimistic that our elasticities will remain favorable as the full array of pricing enters the market. As evidenced by our strong penetration and repeat rates, a growing number of consumers have clearly discovered the convenience and value that our retail portfolio provides. Taken together, the net result of these factors I just detailed is the reaffirmation of our EPS guidance and margin and a few updates on how we expect to get there. We\\'re increasing our organic net sales guidance to be approximately plus 1%, up from approximately flat at the time of our Q4 call., Elasticity,\\nPenetration, Repeat Rates, EPS Guidance, Margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We are reaffirming our adjusted operating margin guidance to remain at approximately 16%. We\\'re updating our gross inflation guidance to about 11%, and we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $2.50. Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to briefly reinforce some of the longer-term tailwinds we believe will benefit us for years to come. This includes enduring trends that predate the COVID-19 pandemic and new consumer behaviors adopted over the past 18 months., Adjusted Operating\\nMargin Guidance, Gross Inflation Guidance, Adjusted EPS Guidance, Longer-term Tailwinds, Consumer\\nBehaviors, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As a reminder, we have a proven track record of successfully attracting millennial and Gen Z consumers at a higher rate than our categories as a whole. By attracting younger consumers now we create the groundwork for future growth. Not only do these younger generations offer the opportunity to drive lifetime value, they\\'re larger than the Gen X generation that immediately preceded them. Historically, younger adults have eaten at home less than older generations., Attracting\\nMillennials and Gen Z, Lifetime Value, Generational Trends, Eating Habits, Future Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The meaningful shift toward at-home eating tends to happen during the family formation years. In particular, we know that annual frozen category spend per buyer increases in households with young kids, and it increases further as the kids grow up. Importantly, almost half of millennials have yet to begin having kids, and we fully expect their consumption of Conagra products will grow along with the growth of their families. Another enduring trend is the growth of snacking, which has long been the fastest-growing occasion in food and shows no signs of slowing down., Tendency towards at-\\nhome eating, Family Formation Years, Frozen Category Spend, Growth of Snacking, Consumption Growth\\nwith Family Size, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We have a very strong $2 billion ready-to-eat snacks business that spans multiple subcategories where we either have the fastest-growing brand, the largest brand or both. The COVID-19 pandemic has only served to accelerate these existing trends and create additional long-term growth drivers. One of the primary drivers for more at-home eating is the shifting workplace dynamics that are meaningfully changing weekday eating behavior. This includes both the contracting workforce and the rise of remote work., Ready-to-Eat Snacks\\nBusiness, COVID-19 Pandemic, Workplace Dynamics, At-Home Eating, Long-term Growth Drivers, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As more people work from home or exit the workforce, the more likely these people are to eat at home, particularly on weekdays. Importantly, some aspects of remote workforce adoption are expected to be permanent. The way we work is changing and that\\'s driving changes in consumer eating habits as well. More time at home also means more time devoted to preparing meals., Work from Home, Exit\\nWorkforce, Eating Habits, Permanent Changes in Consumer Behavior, Preparing Meals, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Younger consumers are acquiring new skills and developing new food habits at a formative age. The behavioral science tells us that when people learn to cook at an early age, they continue to cook at elevated levels as they get older, and consumers of all ages are rediscovering their kitchens and cooking more at home. Across all these long-term tailwinds, we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to meet the needs of today\\'s consumers. Our frozen portfolio offers hyper convenient meals and sides perfect for the quick work lunch or family dinner., Younger Consumers,\\nNew Skills, Food Habits, Behavioral Science, Long-term Tailwinds, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our snacks and sweet treats portfolio caters to those looking to experience bold, anytime flavors at home while enjoying time with friends and family. And our staples portfolio offers the simple cooking aids and meal enhancers that both experienced and first-time cooks are seeking. In summary, Conagra\\'s portfolio has delivered against the recent behavioral shift better than the competition. And as we move beyond the pandemic and millennials and Gen Z-ers continue to age, we believe that our brands are well-positioned to become an even more regular part of their routines., Snacks and Sweet\\nTreats, Staples, Recent Behavioral Shift, Competition, Future Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now that I\\'ve highlighted our performance for the quarter and strong positioning for the future, I\\'ll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail., Performance, Future\\nPositioning, Detail, Quarterly Performance, Company Positioning, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everybody. I\\'ll start by going over some highlights from the quarter shown on Slide 21. As a reminder, our year-over-year comparisons reflect the lapping of extremely strong demand for at-home food consumption during the early months of the pandemic. For that reason, we are also including two-year comparisons for a number of important metrics to provide helpful context regarding the underlying health of our business., Highlights,\\nQuarterly Performance, Pandemic, Business Health, Context, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We are pleased with the overall results of the first quarter, which, as Sean discussed, reflected our ability to successfully navigate the current dynamic environment. Organic net sales declined by 0.4%, compared to a year ago and increased 7% on a two-year CAGR. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating profit both decreased year over year but were flat on a two-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the double-digit inflation experienced in the business during the quarter. I also want to highlight the increase in our advertising and promotional spend on both a one- and two-year basis., Overall Results,\\nDynamic Environment, Organic Net Sales, Adjusted Gross Profit, Advertising and Promotional Spend, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, These investments reflect our continued commitment to building and maintaining strong brands. Turning to Slide 22. I\\'d like to spend a few minutes discussing our net sales for the quarter. On an organic net-sales basis, the 0.4% decrease during the quarter was driven by a 2% decline in volume from lapping last year\\'s elevated demand., Strong Brands, Net\\nSales, Quarterly Performance, Volume, Demand, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This decline was almost entirely offset by favorable brand mix and the pricing actions we\\'ve taken to date in response to the inflationary environment. There are two items I want to call out on price/mix. First, as a reminder, the majority of our domestic retail pricing actions just started to hit shelves at the end of Q1. So the benefit in the quarter was limited compared to the benefits we expect to receive over the course of fiscal \\'22., Brand Mix, Pricing\\nActions, Inflationary Environment, Domestic Retail Pricing, Fiscal \\'22, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Second, our 1.6% benefit from price/mix laps a 70-basis-point benefit in the prior-year period that was associated with the true-up of fiscal \\'20 fourth-quarter trade expense accrual. Without that item, the current quarter\\'s price mix benefit would have been plus 2.3%. Divestitures resulted in a 110-basis-point decline in net sales during the quarter, and foreign exchange provided a 50-basis-point benefit. Together, these factors drove a 1% decline in total Conagra net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago., Price Mix,\\nDivestitures, Foreign Exchange, Total Conagra Net Sales, Year-Over-Year Comparison, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 23 shows our net sales summary by segment, both on a year-over-year and a two-year compounded basis. As you can see, we\\'ve had strong two-year compounded net sales growth in each of our three retail segments with a slight decline in our food service segment. Net sales for the entire company have increased 7% on a two-year CAGR basis. Our two-year annual sales growth rate for the domestic retail segments is tracking closely with the retail consumption growth achieved over the same period., Strong Growth, Two-\\nYear Compounded Net Sales Growth, Domestic Retail Segments, Food Service Segment, Overall Company\\nPerformance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to adjusted operating margin. Slide 24 details the puts and takes of our first-quarter results. First-quarter inflation was 16.6%, driving our adjusted gross margin decline of 530 basis points compared to a year ago. We delivered 550 points of benefit from our margin lever actions in the quarter, inflation-justified pricing, supply chain realized productivity, cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition and lower pandemic-related expenses., Inflation, Adjusted\\nGross Margin, Margin Lever Actions, Cost Synergies, Pandemic-Related Expenses, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, However, these benefits were more than offset by the very significant inflation. Note that the 16.6% inflation shown on the slide represents gross market inflation for Q1 and does not include hedging or sourcing benefits. We capture hedging as part of our realized productivity. For the first quarter, our net inflation inclusive of hedging was high single digits., Inflation, Gross\\nMarket Inflation, Net Inflation, Hedging, Sourcing Benefits, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our Q1 adjusted operating margin was also impacted by year-over-year changes to A&P and adjusted SG&A. As I previously mentioned, we continue to increase our investments in A&P in the quarter. The adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the quarter are shown on Slide 25. As a reminder, we expect our first quarter this fiscal year to benefit the least from our inflation-justified pricing actions., Year-Over-Year\\nChanges in A&P, Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted Operating Profit and Margin by Segment, Expected Benefits\\nfrom Inflation-Justified Pricing Actions, First Quarter Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, It\\'s also worth highlighting again that our adjusted operating profit is flat on a two-year basis. Over a two-year period, we have completely offset double-digit inflation while also increasing investment in the business. As you can see on Slide 26, our Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.50 was heavily impacted by inflation, as well as by a slightly higher tax rate. These headwinds were partially offset by strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count due to our share repurchases during the quarter., Adjusted Operating\\nProfit, Inflation, Adjusted EPS, Ardent Mills Joint Venture, Share Repurchases, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Slide 27. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of four times, which was in line with our expectations and reflects the seasonality of the business. Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were also both in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our capex increased year over year as we remain focused on continued capacity investments to maximize physical availability of our products., Net Debt-to-EBITDA\\nRatio, Cash Flow from Operations, Free Cash Flow, Capex, Focus on Capacity Investments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We also continued to return capital to shareholders during the first quarter. We repurchased approximately $50 million of common stock and paid approximately $132 million in cash dividends. As a reminder, the board of directors approved a 14% increase to our annual dividend in July. We paid our first dividend at the increased quarterly rate of $0.3125 per share or $1.25 per share on an annualized basis shortly after the conclusion of Q1., Returning Capital to\\nShareholders, Common Stock Repurchase, Cash Dividends, Annual Dividend Increase, Board of Directors\\nApproval, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As we have already detailed today, we continue to experience cost of goods sold inflation at a level that is both significant and in excess of the level projected at the time of our Q4 fiscal \\'21 earnings call. We now expect gross cost of goods sold inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal \\'22. We previously expected gross inflation of approximately 9%. This heightened inflationary pressure is coming from increases across many inputs, particularly proteins, edible fats and oils, grains and metal-based packaging., Inflation, Cost of\\nGoods Sold, Fiscal \\'22, Proteins, Edible Fats and Oils, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We are also seeing increasing costs in transportation given marketplace dynamics. We have strong plans in place to mitigate the impact of this inflation. First, we will leverage sourcing and hedging. Given our sourcing and hedging positions, we only expect two-thirds of the 200-basis-point increase in gross inflation to impact the fiscal \\'22 P&L., Inflation,\\nTransportation Costs, Sourcing and Hedging, Fiscal \\'22 P&L Impact, Mitigation Plans, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Regarding quarterly flow, we expect about half of the net impact from this heightened inflation to hit in the fourth quarter. We expect the other half to impact Q2 and Q3 about equally. As a reminder, the benefit of hedging actions is classified as realized productivity in our schedules. In addition to hedging and sourcing, we expect to have a number of drivers to help offset inflation in fiscal \\'22., Quarterly Flow, Net\\nImpact of Inflation, Fiscal \\'22 P&L Impact, Hedging and Sourcing, Offset Inflation Drivers, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As Sean already detailed, these drivers include higher-than-expected consumer demand, lower-than-expected elasticities of demand and incremental inflation-justified pricing beyond our original plan. As Sean noted, the benefits of our incremental pricing actions will be weighted toward the second half of the fiscal year. We are also taking additional actions to enhance supply chain productivity through the balance of fiscal \\'22. And as always, we will maintain a disciplined approach to cost control, which continues to be a hallmark of our culture., Consumer Demand,\\nElasticities of Demand, Incremental Pricing Actions, Supply Chain Productivity, Cost Control, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We now have additional cost savings actions planned beyond what was included as part of our initial guidance for the year. In summary, we intend to leverage our full range of margin drivers to offset the impact of inflation. We expect to realize the benefits from these drivers as the year progresses with the benefits weighted toward the second half of the year. We continue to expect margins to improve sequentially over the remainder of fiscal \\'22., Cost Savings\\nActions, Margin Drivers, Second Half Benefits, Sequential Improvement, Fiscal \\'22 Expectations, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The updated inflation expectations, the higher-than-expected consumer demand and the comprehensive actions we are taking to combat rising costs are all reflected in the updated fiscal \\'22 guidance we issued this morning. We remain confident in our original adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $2.50 for the year, but the path to achieve that guidance has changed. We now expect organic net sales growth of approximately 1% compared to our prior expectations of approximately flat growth. Also, we expect our adjusted operating margin to continue to be approximately 16% but sees some modest compression versus our original forecast., Inflation\\nExpectations, Consumer Demand, Fiscal \\'22 Guidance, Adjusted EPS Guidance, Operating Margin\\nCompression, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect the increase in dollar profit from higher net sales together with incremental cost savings to offset the incremental net inflation dollars. As I explained on last quarter\\'s call, this guidance is our best estimate of how we will perform in fiscal \\'22. But our ultimate performance will be highly dependent on multiple factors, including: first, how consumers purchase food as food service establishments continue to reopen and people return to in-office work and in-person school; second, the level of inflation we ultimately experience; third, the elasticity of demand impact as consumers respond to higher prices; and finally, the ability of our end-to-end supply chain to continue to operate effectively as the pandemic continues to evolve. Before turning it over to the operator for Q&A, I want to reiterate Sean\\'s comments regarding our confidence in the resiliency of our business., Inflation Offset,\\nFiscal \\'22 Guidance, Consumer Behavior, Supply Chain Resilience, Confidence in Business, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2022, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our ability to deliver solid results amid such a dynamic environment reflects the continued dedication of our team, as well as the strength of our brands and the Conagra Way playbook. Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. I\\'ll now pass it to the operator for questions.\\xa0, Strength of Brands,\\nConagra Way Playbook, Team Dedication, Dynamic Environment, Q&A Session, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, our expectations for fiscal 2022, and our perspective on how the Conagra Way playbook positions us for continued success in this dynamic environment. Slide 5 lays out the key points we\\'re going to cover today., Strong Results,\\nFiscal 2022 Expectations, Conagra Way Playbook, Dynamic Environment, Q&A Session, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you saw in our release, we reported very strong results for fiscal 2021 and we could not have done so without our people executing the Conagra Way with excellence. Their dedication enabled us to capitalize on an unprecedented time of consumer demand. Over the last year, we acquired and retained multiple years\\' worth of new consumers, and we grew share across categories, all while continuing to invest in the future. This translated into strong growth across the portfolio., Strong Results,\\nConagra Way Execution, Consumer Demand, Portfolio Growth, Investment in Future, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We saw continued strength in frozen and snacks, as well as increased relevancy for our large staples business. The work we\\'ve done modernizing and premiumizing our portfolio continues to pay off. We believe our brands are healthier than ever and well-positioned to manage through the current inflationary challenges. Dave and I will both share more about our approach to managing rising input costs later in the presentation., Strength in Frozen\\nand Snacks, Relevancy of Large Staples Business, Portfolio Modernization and Premiumization,\\nInflationary Challenges Management, Approach to Managing Rising Input Costs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, But I can tell you now that we\\'re taking aggressive actions on a number of fronts. It\\'s also important to note that our plans provide for continued brand-building investments to drive consumer demand and further enhance brand health. Our business remains very strong, but we are revising our fiscal \\'22 guidance to reflect the lag effect associated with the aggressive mitigating actions we are taking. Essentially, we see fiscal \\'22 as a tale of two halves with the lag effect concentrated in the first half and particularly in Q1., Aggressive Actions,\\nBrand-Building Investments, Fiscal \\'22 Guidance Revision, Lag Effect, First Half Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We expect many of our actions will start to flow through the P&L in Q2, setting up a second-half adjusted EPS in line with what was assumed for H2 within our prior guidance. Given our resiliency over the last year and the compelling consumer trends we\\'re continuing to track, we remain confident in the underlying strength of the business and the opportunities ahead for long-term value creation. As a result, this morning, we announced a 14% increase to our annual dividend, reflecting our board\\'s continued confidence in our outlook. Finally, we plan on hosting an investor meeting next spring to provide an update on our progress and discuss fiscal \\'23 and beyond., Confidence in\\nBusiness Strength, Dividend Increase, Long-Term Value Creation, Second-Half Adjusted EPS, Investor\\nMeeting, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Be on the lookout for more information regarding the event. We hope you can join us. So with that as the backdrop, let\\'s jump into the agenda for today\\'s call. We\\'ll start with our business update and then cover our priorities and value-creation opportunities in fiscal 2022., Business Update,\\nFiscal 2022 Priorities, Value-Creation Opportunities, Event Information, Agenda for Call, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 7, we ended fiscal 2021 with a strong fourth quarter that was in line with our guidance. As you know, our Q4 growth rates were impacted by the unprecedented demand we experienced in 2020 when at-home food consumption surged due to the onset of the pandemic and organic net sales increased 21.5%. Given this dynamic, we\\'ll reference some two-year figures throughout today\\'s presentation to provide more helpful context on the underlying strength and trajectory of the business. And as you can see, on a two-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased by more than 4% and our two-year adjusted EPS grew by more than 22%., Strong Fourth\\nQuarter, Pandemic Impact, Two-Year CAGR Basis, Organic Net Sales Growth, Adjusted EPS Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, On a full-year basis, our organic net sales, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted EPS were all up materially versus fiscal 2020. Continued execution of the Conagra Way playbook served as the foundation for our strong fiscal 2021 performance. Within our industry, success is defined by creating meaningful and lasting connections between consumers and brands. We believe that our playbook is the most effective framework for delivering on that objective., Fiscal 2021\\nPerformance, Conagra Way Playbook, Organic Net Sales Growth, Adjusted Operating Margin Growth, Brand\\nConnection, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our modern approach to brand building is based on three tenets. First, it all starts with developing superior products through perpetual modernization. Second, we ensure the physical availability of our items, both in-store and online. And third, we drive the mental availability of our products to ensure we remain salient and relevant with consumers., Modern Brand\\nBuilding, Product Perpetual Modernization, Physical Availability, Mental Availability, Consumer\\nRelevance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The foundation of the Conagra Way to brand building is our people. Our exceptional results this past fiscal year reflect our team\\'s dedication to executing the Conagra Way each and every day. I would like to pause and say a heartfelt thank you to Conagra\\'s amazing team for rising to the occasion to support each other, our business, our communities, our customers, and our consumers. I\\'m extremely proud of the team\\'s resilience in responding to the volatile environment throughout the year., People, Dedication,\\nResults, Teamwork, Resilience, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We know our long-term performance is a function of the caliber and engagement of our team. That\\'s why we\\'re continuing to invest in our current employees and keeping the door open to talented new additions. In fiscal \\'21, our team\\'s engagement was clearly evident in their intense focus on capturing opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, the pandemic created a unique environment for new consumer acquisition, and we were able to capitalize by having modern products available when and where consumers wanted them., Team Caliber,\\nEmployee Engagement, New Consumer Acquisition, Modern Products Availability, Pandemic Environment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We estimate that over the course of the last fiscal year, we gained the equivalent of more than four years\\' worth of incremental new buyers. COVID effectively amplified new product trials at a level rarely seen in our industry. In the chart on the left, on Slide 10, you can see the increase in household penetration across our portfolio during fiscal 2021, clear evidence of the magnitude of our new consumer acquisition. But what\\'s even more encouraging is the chart on the right., New Consumer\\nAcquisition, Household Penetration, Portfolio Growth, COVID Impact, Chart Analysis, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We didn\\'t just acquire new consumers. We kept them. The data shows that our new consumers discovered the tremendous value proposition our portfolio provides, and we\\'re proud that our products are repeatedly appearing in pantries and freezers across America. Importantly, our performance over the last year was not only strong in the absolute, it was strong relative to the competition., New Consumer\\nRetention, Portfolio Value Proposition, Competitive Performance, Absolute Strength, Relative\\nStrength, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We performed better than our peers in terms of household penetration and repeat rates and we continued to gain share. Keep in mind that we delivered these results despite hitting an upper control limit on the amount of product we could produce in certain categories. If we had additional capacity, these numbers would likely be even more impressive. Our disciplined approach to modernization and innovation across our product portfolio is key to our success., Household\\nPenetration, Repeat Rates, Product Production Limits, Modernization, Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 11, we delivered an impressive innovation slate in fiscal \\'21. Our performance on innovation launched and sold in fiscal \\'21 surpassed the record performance we set in fiscal \\'20. And importantly, our innovation outperformed the competition. This strong outperformance is why even during the height of the pandemic, customers continued to ask for our new products., Innovation,\\nPerformance, Competition, Pandemic Impact, Customer Demand, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, This is a clear testament to the innovation engine at Conagra and the solid reputation we built with customers and consumers. Slide 12 highlights a handful of our important launches in fiscal \\'21. We continued our successful Gardein co-branding strategy with the launch of Marie Callender\\'s pot pie with Gardein protein. We continued to modernize and premiumize Birds Eye with the launch of vegetable bakes that are as good as any side dish you can order from a Chicago steakhouse., Innovation Engine,\\nReputation, Co-Branding Strategy, Product Launches, Modernization, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We began modernizing the Hungry-Man brand with the launch of the Double Meat platform that satisfies the hungriest of appetites. We also continued to work on Duncan Hines with the Instagrammable EPIC line of baking kits along with our keto-friendly mixes. And we found even more ways to keep evolving our Healthy Choice Power Bowls with the launch of these vegetarian and vegan options. I\\'m particularly excited about the Birds Eye breaded vegetables platform we launched in fiscal \\'21., Modernization, Brand\\nLaunches, Product Expansion, Social Media, Vegetarian and Vegan Options, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, It\\'s already started to take off with three of the cauliflower wings products being among the best-selling SKUs in the frozen vegetable category this year. If you haven\\'t tried them, you\\'re missing out. We supported the launch with a robust advertising campaign to drive awareness and mental availability. This campaign included digital, social, and TV advertising., Frozen\\nvegetables, Cauliflower wings, Sales, Advertising campaign, Marketing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In addition to mental availability, we remain focused on the physical availability of our products in Q4, whether through brick-and-mortar or online. Slide 14 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. Growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business continued in fiscal 2021, both against our peers and as a percentage of our overall retail sales. We consistently outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the year., Physical\\navailability, E-commerce, Investments, Growth, Retail sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, E-commerce sales now represent nearly 8% of our total retail sales. And importantly, our success in fiscal 2021 was broad-based. Just take a look at Slide 15. Total Conagra retail sales grew an impressive 11.7% on a two-year basis in the fourth quarter with contributions from each of our retail domains., E-commerce sales, Total retail sales, Growth, Domains, Contributions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, On a two-year basis, we delivered double-digit growth rates in retail sales across our frozen and snacking domains and a solid 5.2% growth rate in staples. Let\\'s dig into each domain a bit more, and let\\'s start with frozen on Slide 16. Over the last two years, our frozen retail sales have surged across desserts, single-serve meals, and multi-serve meals. We\\'ve also seen consistent growth in retail sales of frozen vegetables., Retail\\nsales growth, Double-digit growth rates, Frozen domain, Staples, Growth in retail sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, All in, our strategic frozen business grew 13.5% over the two-year period ending in fiscal 2021. And importantly, our buyers repeatedly returned to our frozen products. As you can see on Slide 17, consumer repeat rates for our leading frozen brands have been stronger than for the competition. Turning to Slide 18., Strategic\\nfrozen business, Growth, Buyers, Consumer repeat rates, Leading frozen brands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our snacks business has seen similar success, delivering strong two-year retail sales growth of 21% in fiscal \\'21, led by increases of more than 25% across hot cocoa, microwave popcorn, ready-to-eat pudding, and meat snacks. As with frozen, consumer repeat rates for a number of our leading snack brands beat those of competition during the fiscal year. Staples was also a meaningful contributor to our success. On Slide 20, you can see the strength of our staples portfolio., Snacks\\nbusiness, Retail sales growth, Consumer repeat rates, Leading snack brands, Staples portfolio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Staples retail sales increased 5.2% over the past two years, spurred by steady growth across key staples categories. Having increasingly rediscovered the joys of cooking last year, consumers reengaged with our staples products in a meaningful way. As you can see on Slide 21, the solid performance from staples was not isolated. We saw strong two-year growth rates across many of our largest staples brands., Staples\\nretail sales, Growth, Key staples categories, Consumer rediscovery, Strong growth rates, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Overall, we\\'re pleased by the performance across our retail business, both within the quarter and over the fiscal year. And as fiscal \\'22 begins, we believe our branded portfolio is stronger than ever. So let\\'s talk about what we see looking ahead. We have a unique opportunity in fiscal \\'22 to leverage our current momentum and maximize long-term value-creation potential., Retail business performance, Branded portfolio strength, Momentum leveraging,\\nLong-term value creation, Fiscal \\'22 outlook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, New behaviors and habits created during the pandemic resulted in an elevated and sustained level of at-home eating. Shoppers are engaging or reengaging with our products now more than ever, creating a larger, high-quality consumer base. To sustain this engagement, we plan to continue making investments in the physical and mental availability for our products. This includes building additional capacity to fulfill consumer demand, making further strategic e-commerce investments, pursuing efficient and thoughtful marketing campaigns, and introducing a robust fiscal \\'22 innovation slate., At-home\\neating, Consumer base, Investments, Marketing campaigns, Innovation slate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we invest in our brands to create new and stronger connections with our consumers, we will also strategically navigate the inflationary environment that accelerated quickly during Q4 and continues today. We\\'re aggressively pulling on all our margin levers to minimize the inflation-related profit lag during the first half. Regardless of near-term cost challenges, we plan to stay focused on the long-term priorities of our business, including continued investments to further support our brands. Our objectives are ultimately focused on driving long-term value creation achieved by pursuing growth in frozen and snacks and maintaining our staples portfolio as a reliable contributor., Investments, Inflation navigation, Margin levers, Long-term priorities, Growth and value creation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s spend a few minutes on our fiscal \\'22 innovation plans for each of the domains. I\\'m excited to provide you a preview of what we have in store. Starting with frozen, once again, we have high expectations for our innovation slate. Slide 24 highlights some of the frozen products that will be rolled out during the year., Fiscal\\n\\'22 innovation plans, Frozen products, Slide 24, Innovation slate, Domains, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hungry-Man has responded very well to recent innovations. We\\'re extending its new Double Meat platform with this Double Chicken Bowl, which is sure to satisfy any big, bold appetite. Our broad snacks portfolio also provides us with plenty of opportunities to innovate. And here is just a sample of our fiscal \\'22 slate., Hungry-\\nMan, Double Meat platform, Double Chicken Bowl, Snacks portfolio, Fiscal \\'22 slate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Among the products on deck, household favorite Duncan Hines will soon be offering additional EPIC kits with versions of classic cookie mixes that combine many of the brand\\'s delicious ingredients. Our highly relevant staples portfolio is also receiving a new slate of innovation as shown on Slide 26. Notably, our great P.F. Chang\\'s brand is launching a variety of new restaurant-inspired products., Duncan\\nHines, EPIC kits, Staples portfolio, P.F. Chang\\'s brand, Slide 26, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Also, as more consumers seek plant-based foods, Gardein continues to expand its portfolio with new offerings, including a new line of plant-based chili. Overall, we\\'re confident that the investments we\\'re making in product innovations across our portfolio will produce strong ROIs. Ultimately, long-term brand health is dependent on the type of perpetual modernization that we\\'re committed to here at Conagra. Before I turn things over to Dave to walk you through the financials, I want to quickly touch on our thoughts around inflation and our updated guidance for fiscal 2022., Product\\ninnovations, Plant-based foods, Gardein, ROIs, Long-term brand health, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dave will discuss the cost environment in more detail, but I want to reinforce that we are aggressively pulling on all of our levers to navigate the current inflationary environment. We began executing our aggressive response plan in fiscal 2021, given the inflation we were already seeing and talking to you about in Q3. The incremental inflation that arose as Q4 unfolded called for additional actions, and you can be assured that we\\'ve begun to respond accordingly. As I\\'ve shared in my remarks, we\\'re also not pulling back from investing in the business., Inflationary environment, Aggressive response plan, Incremental inflation, Business investments,\\nCost environment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We remain squarely focused on long-term value creation. But I also know that a more short-term focused question on all of your minds is, will Conagra take list pricing increases? And the short answer is yes. In fact, we began implementing pricing actions on some of our products in the fourth quarter related to the initial inflation we experienced. The very early read on the data from those actions is that our elasticities look good so far, and we have more pricing coming., Long-term\\nvalue creation, List pricing increases, Pricing actions, Elasticities, Data read, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Because our pricing is being implemented strategically and thoughtfully, we\\'re cautiously optimistic that our elasticities will remain strong as our full array of pricing enters the market in fiscal \\'22. As I mentioned last quarter and earlier in my presentation, we expect the negative impact of the cost inflation to hit our financials before the beneficial impact of our responsive actions, including our pricing. This timing mismatch is expected to be particularly impactful in H1 and more specifically in Q1. The resulting pressure on our first-half margins impact our full-year profit., Strategic\\npricing, Elasticities, Cost inflation, Timing mismatch, First-half margins, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And as you saw in the release, we\\'re updating our fiscal \\'22 guidance as a result. Organic net sales growth is expected to be roughly flat to fiscal \\'21. This results in a CAGR over the three years ending fiscal \\'22 of approximately 3.5%, compared to our original target of 1% to 2%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 16%, and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $2.50., Fiscal\\n\\'22 guidance, Organic net sales growth, CAGR, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Although the substantial increase in inflation over the last few months has negatively impacted our profit guidance for the year, we remain confident in the underlying strength of the business. Even with the lag effect I\\'ve discussed, our full-year guidance delivers significant improvements compared to our fiscal \\'19 starting point. Importantly, we expect that the impacts of our aggressive mitigating actions will cause second-half adjusted EPS to rebound to be in line with what was assumed for H2 within our prior guidance. We\\'re excited about the path the business is on, and we\\'re ready for another dynamic year ahead., Underlying strength of the business, Full-year guidance, Mitigating actions, Second-half adjusted\\nEPS, Dynamic year ahead, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks for your time, everyone. Dave, over to you., Time,\\nDave, Over, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I\\'ll start with some highlights from the quarter and full-year fiscal \\'21, which are shown on Slide 30. Before we get into the details, a reminder that our year-over-year results for the fourth quarter reflect the lapping of the onset of the pandemic in March, April, and May of fiscal \\'20 and the unprecedented surge in consumer demand during that time. Additionally, our Q4 fiscal \\'20 included a 53rd week, which also impacts comparisons to the year-ago period., Highlights from the quarter and full-year fiscal \\'21, Year-over-year results for the fourth\\nquarter, Onset of the pandemic, Consumer demand, 53rd week, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Overall, we are pleased with our performance as our results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. We delivered strong growth for the full fiscal year, including a 5.1% increase in organic net sales; adjusted operating profit of nearly $2 billion, up 7.4% versus fiscal \\'20; and operating margin of 17.5% for the year, an increase of more than 100 basis points versus fiscal \\'20; an adjusted EBITDA increase of 6.5%; and adjusted EPS growth of 15.8% for the year. Turning to Slide 31. You can see the net sales bridge for the fourth quarter and the full year., Strong growth, Organic net sales, Adjusted operating profit, Operating margin, Adjusted\\nEBITDA, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our 10.1% decrease in organic net sales during the quarter was driven by a 12.8% decline in volume due to the comparison to last year\\'s demand surge. The impact of the volume decline was partially offset by a 2.7% benefit from favorable mix and the initial pricing actions we took in response to the elevated inflationary environment, which I will describe in further detail shortly. Divestitures drove a 150-basis-point decline to net sales for the quarter, and we faced an additional headwind of 560 basis points from the lapping of last year\\'s 53rd week. Finally, we experienced a 50 basis point benefit from foreign exchange during the quarter., Organic net\\nsales, Volume decline, Favorable mix, Inflationary environment, Divestitures, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Combined, these factors drove a 16.7% decline in net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago. The bottom half of the slide highlights the drivers of our net sales growth for full-year fiscal \\'21 versus the prior year with an increase in organic net sales of over 5% driven by volume growth and favorable price mix actions. Slide 32 outlines our net sales summary by segment. In the fourth quarter, net sales in our three retail segments declined on both a reported and organic basis due to lapping last year\\'s surge in demand., Net sales\\ngrowth, Volume growth, Favorable price mix actions, Segment performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Conversely, our Foodservice segment grew considerably this quarter as restaurant traffic began to recover. For the full fiscal year, the strong performance in our three retail segments during the first three quarters of the year more than offset the decline in Q4, while our Foodservice segment was negatively impacted by reduced demand for away-from-home eating for most of the year. Slide 33 shows the puts and takes of our fourth-quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin. As you can see, our team did a great job pulling on our margin levers in the quarter, including taking price increases in several retail categories driving favorable mix throughout the portfolio, capturing $20 million of synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition, managing our COVID-19-related costs, which were $36 million in the quarter and continuing to drive strong supply chain productivity., Foodservice\\nsegment growth, Retail segment performance, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted operating margin,\\nCOVID-19-related costs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Despite these efforts, however, we were unable to fully offset cost of goods sold inflation in the quarter. COGS inflation continued to accelerate as the quarter progressed, ultimately landing at 8.6%, which was above the Q4 expectations we shared at the end of Q3. We also increased our A&P by 27% in the quarter as we continue to identify opportunities for strong ROIs on these investments, particularly within e-commerce. Finally, SG&A was a slight margin headwind in the quarter as SG&A dollars decreased at a lower rate than our reported net sales., Cost of goods\\nsold inflation, Acceleration of COGS inflation, A&P investments, SG&A expenses, Reported net sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Cost control and a disciplined approach to SG&A remain a hallmark of our culture here at Conagra. On Slide 34, we detail the operating profit and margin for our segments for the quarter and the full year. Each of our three retail segments declined versus last year\\'s fourth quarter, driven by the lapping of last year\\'s surge in demand and 53rd week, as well as increased cost of goods sold inflation. However, each retail segment reported higher adjusted operating profit than the fourth quarter of fiscal \\'19, demonstrating the sustained progress we have made., Cost control,\\nSG&A expenses, Operating profit and margin, Retail segment performance, Adjusted operating profit, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As I noted earlier, our adjusted EPS of $0.54 was in line with our expectations despite higher-than-expected inflation. The decline in adjusted operating profit and the impact of last year\\'s 53rd week affected our results by $0.23 and $0.05, respectively, shown here on Slide 35. These headwinds were partially offset by strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count resulting from our Q3 share repurchase. Slide 36 summarizes our net debt at fiscal year end and EBITDA and cash flow performance for the fiscal year., Adjusted EPS,\\nInflation impact, Operating profit decline, Net interest expense, Share repurchase, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We ended the year with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.6 times, which is in line with our fiscal \\'21 target. We took advantage of our strong balance sheet throughout the year to increase our investment in the business and return capital to shareholders. During fiscal \\'21, we increased CAPEX by more than $130 million compared to the prior year and funded important capacity and productivity projects. We also repurchased nearly $300 million worth of shares and paid $475 million in dividends in fiscal \\'21., Net debt to\\nEBITDA ratio, Investment in the business, Capital expenditure, Share repurchase, Dividends paid, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we closed the sale of our Egg Beaters liquid egg business at the end of the fourth quarter. Given the timing of the closure, this sale had a minimal impact on our Q4 results, but we expect there to be an annualized net sales impact of roughly $40 million going forward. This will primarily be reflected in our refrigerated and frozen segment with small effects on our international and foodservice segments. We estimate that the sale will have a total annualized impact on our EPS of approximately $0.01., Sale of Egg\\nBeaters business, Minimal impact on Q4 results, Annualized net sales impact, Impact on refrigerated\\nand frozen segment, Total annualized impact on EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As Sean mentioned, we are pleased with our current position in the market and are confident in our ability to continue executing the Conagra Way to drive profitable growth as we look ahead. However, we have experienced an acceleration of inflation since Q3. And due to the timing lag between when this inflation hits our P&L and when the benefits of our pricing and productivity actions take effect, we do not expect to fully offset the impact of these cost increases in time to meet our prior fiscal \\'22 EPS projections. We do expect, however, second-half fiscal \\'22 EPS to be in line with what we assumed for the second half in our prior guidance., Current market\\nposition, Acceleration of inflation, Prior fiscal \\'22 EPS projections, Second-half fiscal \\'22 EPS,\\nTiming lag between P&L and pricing actions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We are therefore updating our guidance as shown on Slide 37. For fiscal \\'22, we now expect organic net sales growth approximately flat to fiscal \\'21, adjusted operating margin of approximately 16%, and adjusted EPS of approximately $2.50. While this guidance is our best estimate of how we will perform in fiscal \\'22, our ultimate performance will be highly dependent on four critical factors: first, how consumers purchase food as restaurants, offices, and schools continue to reopen; second, the level of inflation we ultimately experience; third, the elasticity impact as consumers respond to higher prices; and finally, the ability of our end-to-end supply chain to continue to operate effectively. Slide 38 shows the progression of our fiscal \\'22 inflation expectations, the continued acceleration being the biggest driver of the change in our guidance., Fiscal \\'22 guidance\\nupdate, Organic net sales growth, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted EPS, Critical factors\\nimpacting performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, When we initially gave our fiscal \\'22 targets at our Investor Day in April of 2019, our models assumed an annual inflation rate of around 3%. At the time of our third-quarter call in April of 2021, we expected fiscal \\'22 inflation to come in at twice that level around 6%. Importantly, as of the Q3 call, we still saw a path to deliver our fiscal \\'22 targets. Not only is our brand health strong as evidenced by the strong consumer demand, we know how to pull on all margin levers., Inflation rate,\\nFiscal \\'22 targets, Brand health, Margin levers, Q3 call, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, That said, there is a limit to how much cost increase we can absorb in the short term given the timing lag that Sean and I have discussed. And as all of you know, inflation has continued to rise sharply since April. We now currently expect fiscal \\'22 inflation to come in around 9%. The difference between the 6% we expected a few months ago and the 9% we expect today equates to approximately $255 million in additional costs during fiscal \\'22., Cost increase,\\nTiming lag, Fiscal \\'22 inflation, Additional costs, Impact on fiscal \\'22, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The bulk of this inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of edible fats and oils, proteins, packaging, and transportation since the timing of our Q3 call. While we are able to hedge some of our inputs, others, particularly certain proteins, are not easily hedged. As Sean mentioned, we have various levers at our disposal that we are actively and strategically pulling to manage this inflation, but the profit lag effect is real. For example, certain pricing actions can take 90 days to enact or a cost savings initiative may not be actionable until later in the year when a contract is up for review., Inflation,\\nCost of inputs, Hedging, Profit lag effect, Pricing actions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, So while we anticipate being able to successfully manage inflation over time, the continued sharp increases to input costs we are currently experiencing will take some time to overcome. And given our disciplined approach to managing the business for the long term, we will not reduce investments to meet the guidance target at the expense of the long-term health of our business. Slide 40 lays out the change in our adjusted EPS expectations in a bit more detail. We are updating our fiscal \\'22 adjusted EPS guidance for three items., Anticipated\\ninflation management, Input cost increases, Long-term investments, Adjusted EPS guidance update,\\nSlide 40 detail, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, First, consistent with our prior divestitures, we are removing $0.01 for the Egg Beaters divestiture that we announced today. Second, the largest driver of the change is the significant $0.41 per share increase in inflation since Q3 that I just discussed. And finally, we have identified many ways to manage and offset this increased inflation, including additional productivity and cost savings initiatives, as well as substantial pricing actions that Sean and I have discussed. Again, the bulk of these margin offsets will start to hit our P&L in the second quarter and continue to increase in the second half, which is why we expect second-half EPS to be in line with what we assumed for second-half EPS in our prior fiscal \\'22 guidance., Inflation increase,\\nDivestiture impact, Margin offsets, Second-half EPS, Pricing actions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 41 lays out some of the key assumptions that underlie our fiscal \\'22 expectations. On the top line, we expect organic net sales growth to be stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first. We expect children to return to in-person schooling and more employees to start returning to in-office work in the fall. So while we expect continued strong demand for our products, we also expect COVID-19-related volume benefits to start to slow at the end of our first quarter., Organic net\\nsales growth, Second-half growth, COVID-19 impact, Slide 41 assumptions, Volume benefits, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Additionally, we have good acceptance from customers on our pricing actions so far, but we expect the majority of our pricing to start hitting the market at the end of Q1. We expect the timing of the scale-up to benefit the second half. We also expect our second-half operating margins to be better than the first half. This is driven by our expectation that Q1 will be the most pressured quarter of the year., Pricing\\nacceptance, Timing impact, Second-half margins, First-half pressure, Q1 pressure, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Q1 is expected to have the highest inflation rate of the year and benefit the least from pricing. At the same time, we have planned strong investments behind A&P and innovation for the first quarter. As the year progresses, we expect margins to improve as the inflation rate decelerates and the impacts of our margin lever actions take hold. As you heard Sean discussed, we also plan to continue maintaining strong brand-building support throughout the year to sustain the long-term health of the business., Inflation\\nrate, Pricing investments, Margin improvement, Brand-building support, First quarter planning, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Slide 42. I think it\\'s important to highlight that we expect the actions we are taking in fiscal \\'22 to create some tailwinds heading into fiscal \\'23. As we mentioned, we expect our second-half EPS to be in line with what we assume for second-half EPS in our prior guidance. So as we head into fiscal \\'23, we expect our profitability trend to be in line with our prior expectations., Fiscal \\'22\\nactions, Second-half EPS, Fiscal \\'23 outlook, Profitability trend, Slide 42 highlights, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect our brand building and innovation actions to help maintain retail demand above pre-COVID-19 levels. At the same time, we expect to retain the consumers we have attracted during the pandemic while continuing to attract more. Next, the pricing and productivity actions we are taking will have year on year -- year-over-year benefits in fiscal \\'23 until we lap them. We also plan to continue executing our realized productivity programs to benefit our longer-term margins., Brand building\\nand innovation, Retaining consumers, Pricing and productivity actions, Year-over-year benefits,\\nLonger-term margins, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finally, while we expect to have reductions in COVID-19-related costs in fiscal \\'22, we believe there will be additional opportunities to reduce these costs even further in fiscal \\'23. Turning to capital allocation. As noted in our release this morning, our board of directors has approved a 14% increase to our annual dividend, which is summarized on Slide 43. I\\'m pleased that our strong balance sheet and our confidence in the long-term health and profitability of the business have put us in a position to raise our quarterly dividend to $0.3125 or $1.25 on an annualized basis beginning in September., COVID-19 cost\\nreductions, Capital allocation, Dividend increase, Long-term health, Slide 43 highlights, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This new dividend level represents a 50% payout ratio based on our fiscal \\'22 EPS guidance, which is in line with our longer-term targets. Before I close, I also want to provide some brief color on our tax asset in the disclosure you will see in our upcoming 10-K filing. As some of you remember, when we sold our private label business in 2016, we incurred a tax capital loss of approximately $4 billion that we could apply as a carryforward to offset capital gains generated through fiscal year-end \\'21. We always held true to the principle that we would not divest assets solely because of the existence of the asset, but our team has repeatedly looked for opportunities to maximize the asset\\'s use., Dividend\\npayout ratio, Fiscal \\'22 EPS guidance, Tax assets, Carryforward benefits, Asset maximization, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Since 2016, we utilized approximately half of the asset as we divested businesses that either weren\\'t a strategic fit with our portfolio or were valued in excess of our internal expectations by another party. We also utilized a portion of the asset in connection with the Q4 fiscal \\'21 restructuring of our ownership in Ardent Mills. And before year end, when the carryforward expired, we took additional actions that we believe should allow us to utilize a portion of the remaining capital loss carryforward in future periods. We are currently engaged with the IRS regarding these actions and plan to continue to update our disclosure on this matter as the process unfolds., Tax asset\\nutilization, Asset divestment, Carryforward benefits, Restructuring, IRS updates, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, It\\'s important to note that there is no guarantee that we will be successful in achieving this favorable treatment of the tax asset. However, if we are successful, we could have some additional opportunity for future tax efficiency as we continue to strategically manage our portfolio of brands and investments. That concludes our prepared remarks for today\\'s call. Thanks to everyone for listening., Tax asset\\ntreatment, Future tax efficiency, Strategic brand management, Investment portfolio, Conclusion, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll now pass it back to the operator who can open the line for questions., Tax asset\\nmanagement, Strategic brand management, Investment portfolio, Conclusion, Operator opening, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong third-quarter results, our perspective on how Conagra is succeeding in the current environment, and how we are well-positioned to drive future growth from behavioral tailwinds. So let\\'s get started., Strong\\nresults, Perspective on current environment, Succeeding in current environment, Future growth,\\nBehavioral tailwinds, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our business continued to perform well, both in the absolute and relative to competition during the third quarter. Our ability to deliver for stakeholders during this pandemic is not only a testament to our team\\'s ability to adapt to the current environment but a reflection of the work we\\'ve done to transform our business over the past five-plus years. Our ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook, perpetually reshaping our portfolio and capabilities for better growth and better margins, has enabled us to rise to the occasion during the COVID-19 pandemic and has positioned the business to excel in the future. During the third quarter, we continued to build on our momentum and invested across the company to further strengthen the business., Business\\nperformance, Adaptation to current environment, Transformation of the business, Investment in the\\ncompany, Momentum and growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, This included ongoing investments in physical availability to ensure our products are accessible, online and in stores, and mental availability to ensure we\\'re making the right connections with our consumers. As I\\'ve said previously, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented an incredible consumer trialing opportunity. Our innovation and marketing approach has enabled us to secure not only strong trial but also strong repeat rates and market share gains. Based on the evidence we are seeing, which I will summarize today, we expect to emerge from the pandemic with structurally higher volumes and share driven by the stickiness of the COVID-driven demand., Investments in\\navailability, Consumer trialing opportunity, Innovation and marketing approach, Emergence from\\npandemic, Structurally higher volumes and share, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, But to be clear, we are not relying on these benefits to achieve our fiscal 2022 organic net sales guidance. Given our confidence in the longer-term value creation opportunities of our business, we opportunistically repurchased approximately $300 million of shares in the quarter. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation, which includes investing in our business, maintaining solid investment-grade credit ratings, executing smart M&A, and returning capital to shareholders via share repurchases, and paying an attractive dividend. Our decision to repurchase shares demonstrates our willingness to capitalize on occasions when we believe we\\'re undervalued., Share\\nRepurchases, Capital Allocation, Dividend, Investment-Grade Credit Ratings, Undervaluation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we navigate the current environment, we\\'re seeing input cost inflation accelerate in many of our categories and across the industry. Dave will detail multiple levers we have to manage this inflation. And finally, we are again reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance. I\\'ll unpack these items a bit further in a moment, but I want to start by acknowledging our frontline team., Inflation, Cost Management, Guidance, Frontline Team, Acknowledgement, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our supply chain is a vital component of our success, and I want to commend our team once again for their extraordinary execution amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I\\'m extremely proud of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members whose dedication has enabled our industry-leading performance. We remain focused on keeping employees safe while meeting the needs of our communities, customers, and consumers; and I\\'d like to thank everyone at Conagra for making this possible. Let\\'s get into the business update., Supply\\nChain, COVID-19 Pandemic, Team Execution, Employee Safety, Business Update, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As the table on Slide 8 shows our organic net sales growth of 9.7% exceeded our expectations in the quarter, despite the winter storm in February causing a small temporary disruption in the supply chain. We also delivered adjusted operating margin of 16% and adjusted EPS of $0.59, both in line with our quarterly guidance. This strong performance was driven by our continued execution of the Conagra Way playbook. The foundation of everything we do is building superior products with modern attributes, great taste, and contemporary packaging., Organic\\nNet Sales Growth, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted EPS, Conagra Way Playbook, Product Execution, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our third-quarter results demonstrate the continued strong performance of our new innovation, which is being accepted by customers and sought after by consumers. Once we have the product right, we need to make sure that consumers and customers have access to it across all channels. As we will detail today, this is exemplified by our investments in transportation to ensure physical availability amid elevated demand. And finally, we support the mental availability of our products to ensure we connect with consumers in the right place, at the right time, and with the right messages., New\\nInnovation, Product Availability, Transportation, Consumer Connection, Mental Availability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the third quarter, we supported our brands with continued investments in e-commerce and digital marketing. Our playbook is not just a slogan. It\\'s the framework we use to run the business, and it continues to deliver great results. During the third quarter, we grew retail sales 13.8%, with each of our domains, frozen, staples, and snacks, outpacing the industry., Investments in E-commerce, Digital Marketing, Brand Growth, Retail Sales Growth, Industry\\nOutpacing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As a result, we grew share in each of our domains. Our strong broad-based growth and share gains were fueled by both our superior penetration and repeat purchase rates in the quarter. Slide 11 shows that our household penetration rate during the third quarter was on average double that of our top 15 peers, and we outpaced those same peers in terms of repeat purchase rate. As I mentioned a minute ago, the Conagra Way playbook starts with building superior products., Growth,\\nShare Gains, Penetration Rate, Repeat Purchase Rate, Product Quality, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, When we began this journey over five years ago, we recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio, but it had to be modernized, so we set out to aggressively do just that. And you\\'ll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales come from products launched within the preceding three years. As you can see on Slide 12, our innovation performance has consistently exceeded our 15% goal over the last two fiscal years and through the last 52 weeks, and our fiscal \\'21 innovation is performing even better than prior-year innovation. Compared to last year\\'s launches, the products we introduced through the third quarter this fiscal \\'21 have achieved 66% more sales per UPC and 53% more distribution points per UC than during the comparable time period last year., Innovation\\nPerformance, Goal Achievement, Product Launches, Sales Growth, Distribution Points, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And as you can see on Slide 13, many of our new innovations are leading their categories. Looking ahead, we\\'re starting to see strong customer acceptance our fiscal \\'22 innovation. Customers trust our innovation track record and rely on our new products to drive consumer trial and overall category growth. Slide 14 shows just a few of our exciting innovations that will begin shipping in fiscal 2022., Innovation\\nLeadership, Customer Acceptance, Category Growth, New Products, Fiscal \\'22 Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Critical to our ability to sustain our growing relevancy with consumers is the physical availability of our products, whether through brick-and-mortar or online, and Slide 15 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. Conagra has outpaced total edible retail sales in e-commerce growth each quarter throughout the pandemic, and we have grown share in e-commerce across 76% of our brands over the past year. As we\\'ve discussed before, we believe that e-commerce investment is a high-ROI opportunity to deliver our message to consumers. Slide 16 details some of the specific benefits to expanding our e-commerce platform., Physical\\nAvailability, E-commerce Growth, Share Gains, ROI Opportunity, Specific Benefits, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, E-commerce shoppers over-index to younger millennial consumers. When consumers start to shop online, they\\'re likely to continue the behavior and become heavy users of a brand, and online shoppers, in general, have higher brand loyalty than those shopping in-store. All of this demonstrates the opportunity for superior lifetime value that\\'s being generated by our e-commerce investment and growth. Now, let\\'s turn briefly to each of our retail domains and start with frozen on Slide 17., E-commerce\\nShoppers, Millennial Consumers, Brand Loyalty, Lifetime Value, Retail Domains, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 12% on both a one- and two-year basis in the quarter, which is an acceleration from the second quarter. And Slide 18 demonstrates our growth in frozen accelerated on a sequential basis across many of our leading brands and categories. Our snacks business also continued to deliver strong growth throughout the third quarter. As you can see on Slide 19, we generated double-digit retail sales growth on a year-over-year and two-year basis in snacking, led by impressive increases across popcorn, sweet treats, and meat snacks., Frozen Retail\\nSales, Growth Acceleration, Snacks Business, Leading Brands, Double-Digit Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And as consumers continued snacking at elevated rates, we capitalized with strong Q3 velocity growth across our leading brands. Our staples portfolio also delivered solid results in Q3, including 15% retail sales growth, led by double-digit quarterly growth across key staples categories. And as Slide 22 shows the broad-based growth we delivered in the third quarter exceeded the already strong growth we delivered in the second quarter. People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic, and new younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking., Velocity\\nGrowth, Leading Brands, Staples Portfolio, Double-Digit Growth, Broad-Based Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we\\'ve discussed before, the current environment has resulted in consumers trying or reengaging with our staples products and coming back again and again. Overall, I\\'m very pleased with our end market performance across the portfolio this quarter. And it\\'s even more impressive, given the fact that we delivered these results despite continued supply constraints resulting from sustained elevated demand outpacing our ability to supply. And that takes us to what we see looking ahead., End Market\\nPerformance, Supply Constraints, Demand Outpacing Supply, Quarterly Results, Looking Ahead, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we try to understand where consumer trends are going, it\\'s always helpful to look back at lessons from recent history. During the \\'08/\\'09 recession, we saw consumers shift from primarily consuming meals sourced away from home to meal sourced in home. While this shift is not surprising during the heart of a recession, it\\'s important to recognize that the change in behavior, although event-driven, lasted well past the recovery. And we believe that a good portion of that change in behavior was driven by the formation of new habits., Consumer\\nTrends, Lessons from History, Shift to Home-Sourced Meals, Formation of New Habits, Lasting Behavior\\nChange, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Psychology experts assert that it takes on average 66 days for a new behavior to become habitual. As you all know, we are nearly 400 days into the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumers have adapted to at-home eating and formed new habits that we expect to sustain well beyond the current conditions. And early data supports our hypothesis., Psychology\\nExperts, Behavior Habitualization, COVID-19 Pandemic, Adaptation to At-Home Eating, Early Data\\nSupport, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, If you take a sampling of data from states that have been the most open based on the mobility of their residents throughout the pandemic, what you\\'ll find is the two-year growth rates in retail sales are materially higher than pre-pandemic and fairly consistent as states reopen and stay open. So while people are starting to leave their homes more frequently, they are still choosing to eat at home. Consumers are largely maintaining the habits they\\'ve acquired over the past 400 days, just like psychology predicts. And while we\\'re poised to benefit from sustained elevated at-home eating, we are not resting on our laurels or taking our consumers for granted., Retail Sales\\nGrowth, At-Home Eating Habits, Psychology Predictions, Sustained Elevated Demand, Benefiting from\\nTrends, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re continuing to invest behind our brands to create connections with consumers. Slide 27 shows just one fun example of our innovative approach to brand building. We listen to our communities and identify the trends that resonate with them. As an example, the Slim Jim community online was built on memes., Brand\\nBuilding, Innovative Approach, Community Engagement, Trend Resonance, Online Memes, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Given that fact, DOGE and Dogecoin were a natural fit for our brand. Since joining the online conversation about the Do Good Everyday sentiment of Dogecoin, we\\'ve tapped into another channel for Slim Jim to engage with its community. We\\'ve seen a market uptick in audience interaction, including direct engagement and advocacy from the person that created Dogecoin, as you can see on this slide. Not only is this community hungry for our product and new innovation, but they\\'ve also been quick to rally behind the brand playing a large part in Slim Jim being crowned the champion of Adweek\\'s March Adness Bracket of the top 64 brands., Dogecoin,\\nOnline Conversation, Community Engagement, Brand Awareness, Marketing Uptick, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, On its way to the title, Slim Jim defeated Doritos, Pepsi, Amazon, Wendy\\'s, M&M, and OREO in head-to-head matchups. We\\'re excited about this, and you should be on the lookout for additional crypto-themed activations in the future. And Slim Jim is just one example of how we\\'re connecting with the consumer. Since the onset of COVID-19 last March, we\\'ve gained the equivalent of more than four years\\' worth of incremental new buyers., Slim Jim,\\nDoritos, Pepsi, Amazon, Wendy\\'s, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, COVID has effectively supercharged new trial at a level rarely seen in our industry. Importantly, we\\'re winning with younger consumers. Nearly half of our new buyers are millennials and Gen Z. The steady trends shown on Slide 29 demonstrate that these new buyers are even more likely to repeat purchases across many of our key brands., COVID-19, New\\nTrial, Younger Consumers, Steady Trends, Repeat Purchases, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, They are discovering our modernized portfolio and developing new habits that include our products. And as you can see on Slide 30, we\\'re outpacing our peers in terms of repeat rate as consumers are flocking to our brand more than to those of our top competitors across all of our domains. And we continue to believe that we are very well positioned to capture the benefits of consumer behavior post-pandemic. Let\\'s start with frozen., Consumer\\nBehavior, Modernized Portfolio, New Habits, Repeat Rate, Post-Pandemic Positioning, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The adoption of remote work provides a structural increase in the demand for frozen food compared to pre-COVID levels. Importantly, some aspects of the remote workforce adoption are expected to be permanent. And this shift to remote work has the biggest impact on lunch and dinner occasions, the meals with the largest exposure to frozen foods. Our portfolio of brands and products uniquely meet these consumers\\' needs., Remote Work,\\nDemand Increase, Permanent Shift, Meal Occasions, Brand Portfolio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our frozen portfolio over-indexes in these occasions by offering hyper-convenient meals and sides perfect for a quick lunch or family dinner. In addition to enjoying more food cooked together at home and including frozen as a key part of those meals, consumers are making what we believe is a significant and lasting shift to at-home entertainment. People increased their time spent watching digital video by over 40% in 2020. Recent studies and our understanding of habit formation tell us that this shift toward at-home entertainment is likely to continue post-pandemic., Frozen\\nPortfolio, Quick Lunch, Family Dinner, At-Home Entertainment, Post-Pandemic Habits, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, When consumers, particularly the younger generations, move their entertainment to the home, they increase the number of at-home snacking occasions. And during those occasions, consumers are choosing our brands time and time again. And as I\\'ve already touched on younger groups are engaging more and more with our staples segment as they learn how to cook at home. As the chart on the left demonstrates, young adults are increasingly moving from urban areas to smaller cities and suburbs, where there are fewer options for eating away from home., Younger\\nGenerations, At-Home Snacking, Brand Choice, Urban to Suburban Migration, Learning to Cook at Home, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And as the chart on the right demonstrates, these young consumers, Gen Z, and millennials, are increasingly engaging with Conagra\\'s staples portfolio as they discover their kitchens. Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal \\'22 guidance. As I said earlier, we\\'re not incorporating expectations about the stickiness of COVID-driven demand in our reaffirmation of the organic net sales guidance. However, as we have detailed today, we are increasingly confident that we will benefit from the stickiness of the pandemic-driven demand., Young\\nConsumers, Staples Portfolio, Fiscal \\'22 Guidance, Pandemic-Driven Demand, Stickiness, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And as Dave will discuss, while the current inflationary environment provides us more of a challenge on margin than we were originally expecting, we will be pulling on all of our margin levers to manage through the current environment and remain focused on delivering our profitability targets. So to summarize, we continued to deliver solid execution during the third quarter, and our business remains strong in the absolute and relative to peers. While inflation is accelerating, we have multiple levers to manage inflation and drive margin improvement. And we\\'re continuing our execution of the Conagra Way playbook, which includes investments to capitalize on significant behavioral tailwinds., Margin Levers,\\nInflation Management, Business Execution, Conagra Way Playbook, Behavioral Tailwinds, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I\\'ll start my remarks by calling out a few third-quarter performance highlights, which are captured on Slide 37. As we have detailed this morning, the business continued to perform very well throughout the third quarter. Strong execution from the supply chain and outstanding performance by our teams across the company enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales during the third quarter while meeting margin and earnings targets as we continued to strategically invest in the business while managing inflation., Business\\nPerformance, Execution, Investment Strategy, Margin Management, Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Overall, reported and organic net sales for the quarter increased 8.5% and 9.7% respectively compared to the same period a year ago. Adjusted gross margin increased 12 basis points to 27.5%, and adjusted operating margin increased 31 basis points to 16% in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.9% to $566 million in the quarter, while adjusted diluted EPS grew to $0.59, up 25.5%. Slide 38 illustrates the drivers of our 8.5% net sales growth versus the same period a year ago., Net Sales\\nGrowth, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The 9.7% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 6.1% increase in volume connected to the continued increase in at-home food consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A favorable price/mix impact contributed a 3.6% increase to organic sales growth. As Sean mentioned, our organic sales growth was impacted a bit from the February winter storms that impacted our ability to deliver product for a short time during the quarter. Our strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impact of a 1.2% decrease associated with the divestitures of the Lender\\'s, H.K., At-Home Food\\nConsumption, COVID-19 Pandemic, Price/Mix Impact, Divestitures, Winter Storms, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Anderson, and Peter Pan businesses, as well as the exit of the private label peanut butter business. As a reminder, we completed the divestiture of our Peter Pan business on January 25, which was approximately two months into our fiscal third quarter. Turning to Slide 39. You will find a summary of our net sales by segment., Divestitures,\\nPrivate Label Peanut Butter Business, Net Sales by Segment, Fiscal Third Quarter, Peter Pan\\nBusiness, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, In the third quarter, we saw continued growth in each of our three retail segments on both a reported and organic basis as the continuation of elevated demand for at-home food consumption benefited these segments. Our foodservice segment was negatively impacted by reduced demand away from home. Importantly, innovation momentum in our retail segments continued throughout the quarter. Slide 40 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the third quarter versus the prior year., At-Home Food\\nConsumption, Demand, Innovation Momentum, Adjusted Operating Margin Bridge, Foodservice Segment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As you can see, our adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 16%, in line with our guidance range for the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin increased by 12 basis points in the quarter versus the same period a year ago as our margin levers of mix, cost management, fixed cost leverage, and pricing more than offset the combination of inflation and COVID-related costs. Included in the 180 basis points of COVID-related costs is 60 basis points of additional transportation investments that we made during the quarter. I\\'ll discuss those in more detail in a moment., Adjusted\\nOperating Margin, Adjusted Gross Margin, COVID-Related Costs, Transportation Investments, Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, A&P increased 11.8% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher e-commerce marketing investments, particularly for the refrigerated and frozen segment. And finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable to our operating margin by 30 basis points versus a year ago as net sales grew at a faster pace than SG&A. I\\'d now like to touch on certain transportation investments we made in the quarter. These are incremental transportation costs incurred on top of the core transportation inflation we experienced, so we\\'ve included these in our COVID-19-related costs in the margin bridge., E-commerce\\nMarketing Investments, Adjusted SG&A Rate, Transportation Investments, COVID-19-Related Costs, Core\\nTransportation Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, These investments had a negative impact on our margins, but they helped us deliver more profit dollars. As you can see by Q3 organic net sales exceeding guidance, demand was higher than we expected during the quarter. To adequately service this demand, we made the decision to invest approximately $15 million in the quarter. This meant aggressively seeking out every available truck and adjusting how we ship to customers., Demand,\\nInvestments, Margins, Guidance, Shipping, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, To best service demand for certain brands, we had to bypass our normal distribution network and ship directly to customers. While we incurred additional costs to implement these actions, which impacted our operating margin, this enabled us to minimize out of stocks, maximize on-shelf availability and maximize profit dollars. COVID has provided a period of significant elevated consumer trial of our brands, and our innovation has outperformed expectations, allowing us to gain share with existing and new consumers. Investing to keep product on shelves to support this momentum and to support our retail customers while they manage tighter inventory levels was an easy business decision for us., Demand,\\nInnovation, Operating Margin, COVID, Investments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, While we expect demand to remain elevated for the foreseeable future, we believe we will be in a position to start rebuilding inventory over the next two quarters, which we believe will start removing the need for these incremental investments. I want to take a moment to comment on the input cost inflation we\\'re seeing in the market and provide an overview of what we\\'re doing to navigate it. As you can see on Slide 42, inflation increased 3.9% in the third quarter. This was higher than our 3.5% estimate and reflects the broad-based impact on the cost of materials, manufacturing and transportation, and logistics., Demand,\\nInventory Rebuilding, Input Cost Inflation, Slide 42, Navigating Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We expect the rate of inflation to continue to accelerate over the next few quarters. Fortunately, we have a variety of levers that can be used to offset this pressure, including pricing. We have already mobilized our inflation-justified pricing plans with some actions already in market, others communicated to customers, and some yet to come. History shows us that price adjustments are more likely to be accepted in the market when industrywide and broad-based input cost inflation occurs, and that\\'s the environment we see today., Inflation,\\nPricing, Levers, Market Acceptance, History, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We will also leverage our capabilities beyond just pricing to offset margin pressure, including overall mix management, cost savings measures such as our ongoing supply chain realized productivity programs, and the optimization of our fixed cost leverage. In short, we will continue to closely evaluate the impact of inflation on our business and are confident in our ability to utilize our entire tool kit to manage through this environment. Turning to Slide 43. You can see an outline of our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the quarter., Leveraging\\nCapabilities, Mix Management, Cost Savings, Optimizing Fixed Costs, Managing Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We are very happy with the continued profit growth in our retail business in the quarter, which more than offsets the decline in foodservice. Slide 44 summarizes the drivers of our third-quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. In the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 increased by 25.5% compared to the same period a year ago. The growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion, as well as reduced interest expense driven by lower debt., Profit Growth,\\nRetail Business, Slide 44, Drivers of EPS, Margin Expansion, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 45 summarizes Conagra\\'s net debt and cash flow information. We ended the third quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at our longer-term target of 3.5 times, which is down from 4.8 times a year ago. With our balance sheet in a stronger position and given our strong operating cash flow, we have increased our investments in the business. Our year-to-date capex increased over $130 million compared to last year to fund important capacity and productivity projects., Net Debt, Cash\\nFlow, Investments, Capex, Slide 45, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The combination of the improved balance sheet and strong free cash flow generation has enabled us to return additional capital to shareholders via our recently increased dividend, as well as by executing our first share repurchases since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased 8.8 million shares for $298 million, demonstrating our willingness to capitalize on occasions when we believe we are undervalued. Looking forward, we will continue to be focused on executing a balanced capital allocation policy focused on driving sustainable value creation. We remain committed to maintaining solid investment-grade credit ratings as we use the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet to opportunistically play offense as compelling investment opportunities arise in the future., Dividend,\\nShare Repurchases, Capital Allocation, Credit Ratings, Sustainable Value Creation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 46 summarizes our current outlook. As we\\'ve said throughout our comments today, Conagra\\'s business is performing well, and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to generate continued strong performance in the quarters ahead. For the fourth quarter, we expect organic net sales to decline approximately 10% to 12% as we lap the 21.5% growth in Q4 a year ago. Our Q4 guidance represents a strong two-year growth rate of approximately 7% to 9.5%., Current\\nOutlook, Optimism, Quarterly Guidance, Organic Net Sales, Two-Year Growth Rate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As a reminder, reported net sales will also be impacted by last year\\'s 53rd week. We expect fourth-quarter operating margin to be in the range of 14% to 15%. This estimate includes the combination of continued transportation investments to support product availability at similar levels to Q3, the lag in timing between our pricing actions, and the expected acceleration of inflation, as well as a continuation of the A&P investment increase that started in Q2. As a reminder, our fiscal fourth quarter is historically our lowest operating margin quarter given seasonality and as just mentioned, does not include a 53rd week., Reported Net\\nSales, Operating Margin, Transportation Investments, Pricing Actions, Fiscal Fourth Quarter\\nSeasonality, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Given these sales and margin factors, we expect to deliver fourth-quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.55. Our fourth-quarter guidance also continues to assume that the end-to-end supply chain operates effectively during this period of heightened demand. And finally, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal \\'22 guidance metrics. As Sean mentioned, the benefits of the stickiness of COVID-related demand are not required to reach our fiscal \\'22 organic net sales guidance., Adjusted EPS,\\nEnd-to-End Supply Chain, Fiscal \\'22 Guidance Metrics, Stickiness of COVID-Related Demand, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, While the current inflationary environment provides us more of a challenge on margin than we were originally expecting, we remain focused on utilizing our entire tool kit to deliver our profitability targets, which we are reaffirming today. When we report Q4 results in early July, we plan to provide more detail on our fiscal \\'22 expectations. That concludes my remarks this morning. Thanks for listening., Inflationary\\nEnvironment, Profitability Targets, Fiscal \\'22 Expectations, Q4 Results, Tool Kit, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 3, Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions., Questions,\\nOpening, Operator, Passing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our second-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong second-quarter results as well as our perspective on how Conagra is positioned to continue to succeed in both the current environment and beyond., Strong\\nResults, Perspective, Current Environment, Succeeding, Beyond, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, So, let\\'s get started. I\\'m very pleased with our strong results for the second quarter. Our business continue to perform well both in the absolute and relative to peers. Our success to date in fiscal 2021 is not only a testament to our team\\'s ability to adapt to the current environment but a reflection of the work we\\'ve done to transform our business over the past five-plus years., Strong\\nResults, Business Performance, Fiscal 2021, Transformation, Team\\'s Ability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook perpetually reshaping our portfolio and capabilities for better growth and better margins has enabled us to rise to the occasion during the COVID-19 pandemic. And that has positioned the business to excel in the future. During the second quarter, we continue to build on our momentum and our Q2 results exceeded our expectations across the board. We had strong, broad-based sales growth, our margin expansion is ahead of schedule, and I\\'m proud to announce that we\\'ve reached our deleveraging targets earlier than originally planned., Ongoing\\nExecution, Conagra Way Playbook, Portfolio and Capabilities, Q2 Results, Deleveraging Targets, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In keeping with our Conagra Way playbook, we continue to optimize the business for long-term value creation during the quarter. We made targeted investments in both production capacity and marketing support to drive the physical and mental availability of our products. We also remained committed to sculpting our portfolio through smart divestments with the agreement shortly after the second quarter closed to sell Peter Pan Peanut Butter. Peter Pan is a very good business, but it\\'s not an investment priority for Conagra given our other portfolio priorities., Optimization, Investments, Portfolio Priorities, Divestment, Value Creation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance for all metrics. And none of this would be possible without our exceptional team, particularly our frontline workers. So, before we dive into the details of the quarter, I want to recognize everyone responsible for the continued extraordinary work of our supply chain. I\\'m extremely proud of the thousands of hardworking Conagra team members whose dedication has enabled our industry-leading performance., Guidance, Team, Supply Chain, Performance, Industry Leading, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We remain focused on keeping employees safe while meeting the needs of our communities, customers, and consumers. And I\\'d like to thank everyone at Conagra for making this possible. With that, let\\'s get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our second-quarter results exceeded our expectations across the board., Focused, Safety, Communities, Customers, Consumers, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We delivered organic net sales growth of 8.1%, adjusted operating margin of 19.6%, and adjusted EPS of $0.81. These results enabled us to reach our fiscal \\'21 net leverage ratio target of 3.6 times ahead of schedule. During the second quarter, we continued to drive significant growth across our retail business. Total Conagra retail sales grew 10.4% year over year with strong growth across each of our snacks, frozen, and staples portfolios., Growth, Sales, Margin, EPS, Fiscal 21 Net Leverage Ratio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our results were driven by continued success in expanding our presence with consumers and gaining share. Total Conagra household penetration grew 14 basis points versus a year, ago and our category share increased 26 basis points. Critical to our ability to sustain our growing relevancy with consumers is the physical availability of our products, whether through brick and mortar or online. And Slide 9 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results., Success, Presence, Share, Availability, Investments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the chart on the left, you can see the step-change in e-commerce growth for total edibles that has occurred since the onset of the pandemic. But what\\'s really impressive about this chart is the sustainability of our e-commerce performance. We\\'ve retained a massive portion of the e-commerce sales we gained at the onset of the pandemic, and our results have outpaced total edible e-commerce growth each quarter. As a result of our sustained success, e-commerce continued its recent trend of steadily increasing as a percentage of our total retail sales as you can see on the right., E-commerce Growth, Sustainability, Retained Sales, Percentage Increase, Total\\nRetail Sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, While e-commerce growth both on an absolute basis and as a percent of overall sales is not a new dynamic for Conagra, this growth has accelerated during COVID-19. In addition to our continued progress in e-commerce, our new innovation generated strong performance during the second quarter. When we began this journey over five years ago, we\\'ve recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio, it just had to be modernized. So, we set out to aggressively do just that., E-commerce Growth, New Innovation, Portfolio Modernization, Performance, Journey, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And you\\'ll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales come from products launched within the preceding three years. As you can see on Slide 10, our innovation performance has continued to exceed our 15% goal. What\\'s equally important is the consistency of our innovation performance. Investments we\\'ve made over the last five years in our innovation capabilities enabled us to continue launching new products since the pandemic began., Innovation Performance, Retail Sales, Goal Achievement, Consistency, Investments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Customers trust our innovation track record and rely on our new products to drive consumer trial and overall category growth. Slide 11 drills down on the strength of our recent innovation performance compared to last year\\'s first half launches. The products we introduced in the first half of this year have achieved 37% more sales per UPC, and 28% more distribution points per UPC during the comparable time period. Product performance highlights include Marie Calendars boast the No., Trust, Innovation Performance, Sales Growth, Distribution, Product Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, 1 branded new item in frozen indulgent single-serve meals. Duncan Hines has delivered the top 3 highest velocity new items in the single-serve baking, and our modernized Hungry Man brand is outpacing category growth by more than two times. After a strong first half of fiscal \\'21, we will introduce even more new products that will build distribution in the second half. Expect to hear more about our upcoming product launches at CAGNY next month., Branded New Item, Frozen Indulgent Meals, Velocity, Modernized Brand, Upcoming\\nProduct Launches, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning now to Slide 12, total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 8.3% versus a year ago thanks to strong growth in each of our four main frozen categories. Importantly, our terrific frozen vegetables business returned to strong growth in the quarter as we brought on our additional capacity investments online. Slide 13 digs a bit deeper into our largest frozen brand, Birdseye. Birdseye is a cornerstone of the important frozen vegetable segment with a No., Total Frozen Retail Sales, Strong Growth, Main Frozen Categories, Additional\\nCapacity Investments, Birdseye Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, 1 position in the category, more than twice the category share of the closest branded competitor. Recall that Birdseye previously faced some supply constraints as we worked to bring new capacity online. And last quarter, I noted that shipments for the brand were a bit ahead of consumption as retailers started rebuilding their inventories. As you can see in the charts on Slide 13, Birdseye returned to form in Q2 as expected., Birdseye Performance, Supply Constraints, Category Share, Inventory Rebuilding, Q2\\nPerformance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In addition to strong retail sales growth of 7.2% in quarter, Birdseye gained an impressive 261 basis points of share from Q1 to Q2. Continuing to Slide 14, you can see how Birdseye has attracted and retained more new buyers than our competition since the pandemic began. Frozen vegetables category remains highly relevant to consumers and we believe the steps we\\'ve taken over the past several quarters to modernize the Birdseye brand and expand capacity have positioned us well to build on our category leadership. Turning now to another area of strength, our leading portfolio of frozen single-serve meals had another terrific quarter., Birdseye Performance, Retail Sales Growth, New Buyers, Category Leadership, Frozen\\nSingle-Serve Meals, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 15, Conagra has outperformed peers, driven category growth, and attracted new buyers since the start of the pandemic. As the chart on this slide shows, we have three of the top brands in this category from both the trial and repeat perspective. Our snacks business also continued to see strong growth in the quarter. As you can see on Slide 16, we delivered double-digit retail sales growth on a year-over-year and two-year basis in snacking led by impressive results across the popcorn, sweet treats, and meat snacks., Peer Performance, Category Growth, New Buyers, Snack Sales Growth, Top Brands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re not just growing, we\\'re winning versus the competition. Slide 17 shows how we grew share year over year in popcorn, meat snacks, hot cocoa, and ready-to-eat pudding and gelatin in the quarter. Our staples portfolio also delivered solid results in Q2. Historically, this portfolio has served as a -- primarily as a source of cash for us but it hasn\\'t been looked at as a growth engine., Growing vs Competition, Share Gain, Staples Portfolio, Quarterly Results,\\nHistorical Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, But Slide 18 shows how staples remained highly relevant to consumers in the quarter as people continue to rediscover cooking and the utility, relevance, and value of products in our portfolio. Our basket of the total staples category grew retail sales by 12.7% in the second quarter. People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic and new, younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking. Many of the brands on this slide including PAM, RoTel, and Hunt\\'s are cooking utilities and ingredients., Staples Relevance, Quarterly Results, Basket Growth, Cooking Utilities, New\\nConsumers, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we\\'ve discussed before, the current environment has resulted in consumers trying or reengaging with our products and coming back again and again. And that takes us to what we see going forward and how our business is uniquely set up to win. Our execution of the Conagra Way playbook over the last five-plus years enabled us to deliver strong performance prior to the onset of COVID. And we firmly believe that our reshaped portfolio, modernized products, and enhanced capabilities have been foundational to our ability to excel during these highly dynamic times., Consumer Behavior, Business Performance, Conagra Way, Portfolio Reshaping, Dynamic\\nMarket, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We all know that the COVID pandemic has driven an increase in at-home eating overall. But for Conagra, it has also meant an acceleration of the consumer trial, adoption, and repeat purchase rates of our products. Our results have been strong on both in absolute and relative basis. These dynamics have driven meaningful levels of incremental cash flow for our business., At-Home Eating, Consumer Trial, Adoption, Repeat Purchase Rates, Incremental Cash\\nFlow, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, They\\'ve also enhance the ROI of our previous disciplined investments in portfolio, capabilities, and the physical and mental availability of our products. Importantly, the Conagra Way is perpetual. While we\\'ve adapted to the current environment and deliver superior results, we also continue to look to the future and make smart investments to further strengthen our business. Our investments include continuing to modernize our products and packaging, increasing production capacity when category dynamics warrant, supporting on-shelf availability, and increased e-commerce share, and raising consumer awareness., ROI of Investments, Conagra Way, Modernization of Products, Production Capacity,\\nE-commerce Share, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, To be clear, these investments are not a reaction to the near-term environment but to see as rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business and our disciplined execution of the Conagra way. We believe that Conagra is in a strong position to continue to win now and for years to come. We expect that our investments, coupled with consumer adoption and the proven stickiness of our products will result in Conagra continuing to deliver long-term profitable growth. In summary, we continue to see solid execution across our portfolio aligned with the Conagra way playbook in Q2 which enabled us to deliver results that exceeded our expectations., Investments, Long-term Growth, Consumer Adoption, Product Stickiness, Portfolio\\nExecution, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our business remains strong in the absolute and relative to competition. And we expect Conagra to be in an even better position post-COVID as a result of our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation. And with that, I\\'ll turn it over to Dave., Business Strength, Competition, Investment, Innovation, Post-COVID Position, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Today, I\\'ll walk through the details of our second-quarter fiscal \\'21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. I\\'ll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the quarter which were captured on Slide 22., Performance Highlights, Q3 Outlook, Slide 22, Q&A, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As Sean mentioned, outstanding execution by our teams across the company enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, margin, profitability, and deleveraging during the second quarter while we continued to invest in the business. Reported and organic net sales for the quarter were up 6.2% and 8.1%, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. We continued our strong margin performance from Q1 as Q2 adjusted gross margin increased 139 basis points to 29.9%. Adjusted operating margins increased 250 basis points to 19.6%., Net Sales, Margin, Profitability, Deleveraging, Investment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.7% to $712 million in the quarter. And our adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.6% to $0.81 for the second quarter. Slide 23 breaks out the drivers of our 6.2% second-quarter net sales growth. As you can see, the 8.1% increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by a 6.6% increase in volume related to the growth of at-home food consumption., Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Net Sales Growth, Volume Growth, At-home\\nFood Consumption, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The favorable impact of price mix which was evenly driven by favorable sales mix and less trade merchandising also contributed to our growth. The strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impacts of foreign exchange and a 1.7% net decrease associated with divestitures. The Peter Pan peanut butter business is still part of Conagra Brands and thus included in our organic results. We expect the sale of Peter Pan to be completed in Q3 at which point it will be removed from organic net sales growth., Price Mix, Sales Mix, Foreign Exchange, Divestitures, Peter Pan Peanut Butter, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I will discuss the estimated impact of this divestiture shortly. Slide 24 summarizes our net sales by segment for the second quarter. On both the reported and organic basis, we saw continued significant growth in each of our three retail segments: grocery and snacks, refrigerated and frozen, and international. The net sales increase was primarily driven by the increase of at-home food consumption as a result of COVID-19, which benefited our retail segments but negatively impacted our food service segment., Net Sales Growth, Segment Performance, At-home Food Consumption, COVID-19 Impact,\\nDivestiture Impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The grocery and snack segment experienced strong organic net sales growth of 15.3% in the quarter. The segments we\\'re getting net sales growth outpaced its growth in consumption as retailers continued to rebuild inventories. Our refrigerated and frozen segment delivered organic net sales growth of 7.8%. This growth is a testament to our continued modernization and innovation efforts and illustrates the increasingly important role refrigerated and frozen products play in meeting the evolving needs of today\\'s consumers., Grocery and Snacks, Refrigerated and Frozen, Consumption, Innovation,\\nModernization, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to the international segment. Quarterly organic net sales increased 9.1%. This segment experienced particularly strong growth in both Canada and Mexico. This quarter, our food service segment reported a 21.4% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by a volume decrease of 25.3% due to less restaurant traffic as a result of COVID-19., International Segment, Food Service Segment, COVID-19 Impact, Volume Decrease, Net\\nSales Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 25 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the quarter versus the prior-year period. As you can see, in the second quarter, our adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Strong supply chain realized productivity, favorable price mix, cost synergies associated with Pinnacle Foods acquisition, and fixed cost leverage combined to drive 440 basis points in adjusted operating margin improvement more than offsetting the impact of cost of goods sold inflation and COVID-related costs in the quarter. Collectively, these drivers resulted in a 139 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin versus the same period a year ago., Adjusted Operating Margin, Price Mix, Cost Synergies, COVID-related Costs,\\nAdjusted Gross Margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, A&P increased 4.7% on a dollar basis primarily due to increases in e-commerce marketing A&P was flat on a percentage-of-sales basis this quarter versus Q2 a year ago. Finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable by 110 basis points primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales, the Pinnacle cost synergies, and temporarily reduced spending as employees work from home and significantly reduce their travel. I want to give you some additional perspective on our margin expansion. As I just mentioned, operating margin expanded 250 basis points for the quarter well ahead of our expectations., A&P Growth, SG&A Rate, Margin Expansion, E-commerce Marketing, Cost Synergies, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Of this 250 basis point expansion in operating margin this quarter, approximately 60 basis points reflects our ongoing progress toward achieving our fiscal \\'22 margin target of 18% to 19%. We also saw an approximate 180 basis point margin benefit from price mix in the quarter primarily driven by mix, and to a lesser extent, favorable pricing in lower-trade merchandising. We expect to retain some of this benefit going forward, but exactly how much remains uncertain at this point. Additional 10 basis points of net margin expansion came from favorable fixed cost leverage across the entire P&L and COVID-related SG&A benefits, mostly offset by COVID-related cost of goods sold., Margin Expansion, Price Mix, Fixed Cost Leverage, COVID-related Benefits, COVID-\\nrelated Costs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We do not expect this net benefit to repeat next year. Slide 26 summarizes our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the second quarter. Our three retail segments, all operating profits increased by double-digit percentages versus the same period a year ago. Each retail segment benefited from higher organic net sales and strong supply chain-realized productivity., Retail Segments, Operating Profits, Organic Net Sales, Supply Chain Productivity,\\nSlide 26, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In the foodservice segment, however, operating profit decreased due to the COVID-related impacts of lower organic net sales and higher input costs that more than offset the impacts of favorable supply chain-realized productivity and cost synergies. Overall, we\\'re pleased with the continuation of the strong Q1 margin results into the second quarter which are anchored by core productivity and benefits from the Pinnacle acquisition we expected to see. Turning to Slide 27. We\\'ve outlined the drivers of our second-quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth versus the same period a year ago., Foodservice Segment, Operating Profit, COVID-related Impacts, Supply Chain\\nProductivity, Cost Synergies, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, EPS increased 28.6% to $0.81. The growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion, and also benefited from a decrease in net interest expense as we\\'ve continued to reduce debt as prioritized. Slide 28 highlights our significant progress on the overall synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal \\'19. We captured an incremental $27 million in savings during the most recent quarter bringing total cumulative synergies to $246 million., EPS Growth, Adjusted Operating Profit, Net Sales Increase, Margin Expansion,\\nSynergy Capture, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As a reminder, the majority of total synergy to date have been in SG&A. Cost-of-goods-sold synergies have started to be a bigger portion of our synergy cash for the last two quarters and we expect them to make up a majority of our synergies going forward. We remain pleased with the team\\'s progress in capturing synergies and remain on track to achieve our fiscal \\'22 synergy targets. Slide 29 shows the strong progress we\\'ve made to date to achieve our deleveraging targets., Synergy Capture, SG&A Synergies, Cost of Goods Sold Synergies, Deleveraging\\nTargets, Slide 29, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal \\'19 through the end of the second quarter fiscal \\'21, we have reduced total gross debt by $2.3 billion resulting in net debt of $9.2 billion. We are pleased to report that at the end of the second quarter, we achieved our net leverage ratio target of 3.6 times, down from five times at the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition and 3.7 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal \\'21. Strong, consistent improvements in debt reduction, coupled with robust earnings enabled us to achieve this net leverage ratio target ahead of schedule. Looking ahead, we will continue to be focused on executing a balanced capital allocation policy., Debt Reduction, Net Leverage Ratio, Capital Allocation, Earnings, Schedule, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings as we continue to be opportunistic using our balance sheet to drive shareholder value such as our increased investment in capex and the recent 29% dividend increase. Slide 30 summarizes our outlook. As Sean and I have both said throughout this presentation, we believe in the strength of Conagra\\'s future. While we\\'re confident in the quarters ahead and that Conagra will continue to excel beyond the COVID-19 environment, the sustained impact of COVID-19 remains dynamic and continues to make near-term forecasting with specificity a challenge., Investment-grade Credit Ratings, Balance Sheet, Capex Investment, Dividend\\nIncrease, Slide 30, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect a continuation of elevated retail demand and reduced foodservice demand compared to historic pre-COVID-19 demand levels. We are currently seeing both of these trends continue in the third quarter to date. For the third quarter, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of plus 6% to 8%. We expect Q3 operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%, implying a year-over-year increase of 30 to 80 basis points., Elevated Retail Demand, Reduced Foodservice Demand, Organic Net Sales Growth, Q3\\nOperating Margin, Year-over-Year Increase, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This estimate includes an expected acceleration of our AMC investment in e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2, reducing the estimated year-over-year Q3 operating margin expansion. As a reminder, Q3 operating margins are historically lower than Q2 operating margins given the leverage impact on the seasonality of sales. Given these sales and margin factors along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third-quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.60. Our third-quarter guidance also continues to assume that the end-to-end supply chain operates effectively during this period of heightened demand., AMC Investment, E-commerce Marketing, Q3 Operating Margin, Sales Seasonality,\\nBelow-the-Line Items, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As outlined in our earnings release, our third quarter guidance does not yet include any impacts from the pending sale of the Peter Pan business. We are selling the business for approximately $102 million and the expected annualized impact of the divestiture is a reduction of approximately $110 million of net sales and $0.03 of adjusted EPS. Lastly, we are reaffirming all metrics of our fiscal \\'22 guidance which also excludes the impact of the pending sale of Peter Pan. We look forward to presenting again next month at CAGNY where we will provide another update on our progress in executing the Conagra Way., Third Quarter Guidance, Pending Sale of Peter Pan Business, Net Sales Reduction,\\nAdjusted EPS Impact, Fiscal \\'22 Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 2, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We hope you\\'ll join us. Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks this morning. I\\'ll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions., Remarks, Join Us, Questions, Operator, Closing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. I hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy. Today, I\\'m going to unpack the quarter for you and then share our perspective on how the evolving consumer environment is shaping longer-term demand for our products., Good Morning, Earnings Call, Quarterly Results, Consumer Environment, Longer-term\\nDemand, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, So let\\'s get started. Building upon our impressive momentum at the end of last year, we\\'re off to a strong start in Q1. We exceeded our expectations and saw broad-based strength across the portfolio. We will detail today we believe our business is well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results, both in the near and long term., Strong Start, Broad-Based Strength, Portfolio, Near Term, Long Term, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The transformation we\\'ve undertaken over the past five years by following our Conagra Way playbook to perpetually reshape our portfolio and capabilities for growth and better margins has proven critical in enabling us to respond to the changing dynamics in the current environment. Our modernized portfolio, commitment to innovate, and agile culture have allowed us to respond to the increased consumer demand and changing preferences today and position us to deliver meaningful growth into the future. Our robust performance has also helped us to get ahead of our expected deleveraging cadence. As Dave will detail later, we expect to reach our net leverage ratio target of 3.5 times to 3.6 times by the third quarter of fiscal 2021., Conagra Way, Portfolio, Innovation, Culture, Deleveraging Cadence, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Paying down debt has been a capital allocation priority in recent quarters, but you also know that we are committed long term to a balanced capital-allocation approach. Given our progress on deleveraging and because we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business, our board has increased our quarterly dividend by 29% to $1.10 on an annualized basis. And as I\\'ll discuss more, we also continue to invest in the business. Our performance reflects the great work our team has accomplished during these challenging times., Paying Down Debt, Capital Allocation Priority, Long-term Outlook, Dividend\\nIncrease, Business Investment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In particular, I want to recognize the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members on the front lines. Their extraordinary efforts in simultaneously keeping employees safe and maximizing our supplies have made it possible for us to continue to meet the needs of our communities, customers, and consumers, and I couldn\\'t be prouder of them. Let\\'s get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our execution in the quarter enabled us to exceed our expectations across the board., Team Members, Safety, Supplies, Business Update, Execution, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We delivered organic net sales growth of 15%, adjusted operating margins of 20.2%, adjusted EPS of $0.70. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.7 times compared to 4.0 times at the end of Q4. During the first quarter, we continued to drive significant growth in each of our three retail segments. Total Conagra retail sales grew 12.9% year over year, driven by double-digit growth in snacks, frozen, and staples., Organic Net Sales Growth, Adjusted Operating Margins, Adjusted EPS, Net Leverage\\nRatio, Retail Segments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Importantly, our higher-margin, non-promoted volume contributed significantly to this growth. And not only did we grow at a great rate, we expanded our presence with consumers and gained share. We increased household penetration by 100 basis points and category share by 30 basis points. Slide 9 demonstrates how our investments in e-commerce over the last several years continued to yield results in the quarter., Higher-Margin Volume, Growth Rate, Consumer Presence, Household Penetration,\\nE-Commerce Investments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Strengthening our e-commerce capabilities has been an area of focus for us, and we\\'re seeing the fruits of our labor. Our e-commerce retail sales have recently demonstrated impressive growth and, over the past five quarters, have consistently outpaced total industry e-commerce growth. First quarter also saw continued strong innovation momentum. Our steadfast commitment to the Conagra Way playbook has enabled us to consistently exceed our goal of having 15% of total retail sales each year coming from products launched within the past three years., E-commerce Capabilities, E-commerce Retail Sales, Innovation Momentum, Conagra Way\\nPlaybook, Total Retail Sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And of course, as our overall sales continue to increase, this percentage of sales represents a larger absolute dollar amount. Even during these challenging times, we remain committed to delivering innovation to our customers and consumers. Our growth is rooted in innovation, and we are driving category performance. Slide 11 highlights two examples in big growth areas: frozen and snacks., Increasing Sales, Absolute Dollar Amount, Innovation, Category Performance, Growth\\nAreas (Frozen and Snacks), Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s take a look at the frozen single-serve meals category. As compared to our fiscal \\'17, this category experienced a $575 million increase in retail sales during the 52-week period ended August 30. Our innovation in frozen single-serve meals over the past three years is unmistakable. We\\'ve generated almost 100% of that category\\'s growth over the same period., Frozen single-serve meals, Retail sales, Innovation, Growth, Category, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve applied this proven strategy to our snacks portfolio and are seeing similar category-driving growth. Slim Jim has consistently gained share and has the top position in dollar sales for meat snack innovation. And to top it all off, our new Slim Jim Savage stick has the No. 1 velocity in all meat snacks., Snacks portfolio,\\nCategory growth, Share gain, Velocity, Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Given this track record, our innovation success has earned tremendous credibility with our customers. And our most recent slate of innovation is enabling us to further enhance that credibility. Slide 12 shows some of the highlights, offerings packed with modern food attributes and bold, on-trend flavors. Some of these began launching in Q4, and we\\'re pleased with their early end-market performance., Innovation,\\nCredibility, Customers, Modern food attributes, Bold flavors, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We will continue to roll these out throughout the year. We\\'re also excited about the innovations shown here on Slide 13. We\\'re using our broad portfolio to extend high-growth brands beyond their legacy forms. By leveraging our existing capabilities, we\\'re extending Gardein and Healthy Choice into attractive categories with large profit pools: soups, jerky, and salad dressing., Innovation, Portfolio\\nextension, Growth brands, Legacy forms, Profit pools, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And these two success stories are even going one step further, co-branding single-serve frozen meals. Slide 14 shows some examples of what else we have on deck for the balance of fiscal \\'21. Clearly, we are not slowing down on our innovation agenda. I\\'d now like to take a moment to touch on recent performance in our three domestic retail domains, starting with frozen., Frozen meals, Co-\\nbranding, Retail domains, Innovation agenda, Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 15 shows our impressive performance in total frozen during the quarter. This business is over $5 billion in annual retail sales, and it grew 13.5% in the quarter with double-digit growth in single-serve meals, multi-serve meals, and plant-based meat alternatives. With respect to frozen vegetables, recall that last quarter, we were supply constrained in Birds Eye. Demand was in excess of our available capacity, exacerbated by a brief plant shutdown to keep our employees safe and healthy., Frozen meals, Retail\\nsales, Growth, Plant-based meat alternatives, Supply chain, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'m pleased to report that during the first quarter, our Birds Eye plants are at full capacity and, as the quarter progressed, we qualified external manufacturers to supplement our capabilities. While our consumption in frozen vegetables grew 0.7% in the quarter, our shipments grew at a much faster rate as retailers started rebuilding inventories. Sitting here today, Birds Eye, which holds the No. 1 position in the category and has over twice the category share compared to the closest branded competitor, is very well-positioned as we enter the important holiday season., Birds Eye, Frozen\\nvegetables, Capacity, Inventory, Holiday season, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to snacks. Snacks business delivered another impressive quarter of growth, 14.6% versus the previous year and 22.7% on a two-year basis. In meat snacks, we are working to maintain our growth and capabilities by investing in expanded capacity at our Troy, Ohio plant. To be clear, this investment is not a reaction to the near-term environment but a decision made pre-COVID and rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business., Snacks, Growth,\\nCapacity, Investment, Longer-term outlook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our meaningful staples results, as shown on Slide 17, demonstrate that this domain remains extremely relevant. Our staples business grew retail sales 11.6% year over year with strong performance across our portfolio of iconic brands. I\\'d now like to turn to our perspective on the evolving environment and what we see going forward. While we hope and expect that the most acute and severe impact of COVID-19 is behind us, we believe that recent shifts in consumer behavior, coupled with macroeconomic trends, suggest that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time., Staples business,\\nRetail sales growth, Consumer behavior, Macroeconomic trends, Elevated at-home eating, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also believe that we are very well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. I\\'ll unpack these points a little bit more, but we see consumers experiencing and making lifestyle changes driven by COVID-19 that suggests the arrival of a sustained shift in eating habits. We also know from prior recessions that an economic downturn typically leads to a permanent increase in at-home eating, even when economic growth returns. These consumer trends affect everyone in our industry, but we believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit substantially from this environment., Consumer trends,\\nLifestyle changes, Sustained shift in eating habits, Economic downturn, Industry benefits, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our portfolio is well developed in the eating occasions that have seen the most significant and sustained shift to at-home eating, and our portfolio delivers against the cooking behaviors that consumers are adopting. We\\'re attracting more new buyers than our peers, and consumers are choosing to stick with Conagra and come back for more. With our proven track record of innovation, we believe we will continue to attract new consumers and deliver food that meets their evolving needs. Let\\'s drill down on some of the proof points that underpin these expectations, starting with why we believe at-home eating will remain elevated., Elevated at-home\\neating, Consumer preferences, Innovation, New buyer acquisition, Proof points, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you know, the vast majority of our sales are sourced from the United States. And unfortunately, the U.S. economy has been greatly affected by the pandemic. Unemployment in the U.S., United States\\neconomy, Pandemic impact, Unemployment, Sales sources, Economic effects, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, remains high, the pace of new job growth is decelerating and many U.S. households have limited savings. To understand how this recession may impact Americans\\' eating habits going forward, we looked back at how behavior changed in the wake of the last recession. Slide 20 shows the percent of eating occasions that have been sourced at-home in the U.S., Recession impact,\\nEating habits, Job growth deceleration, Limited savings, Behavior change, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, since 2007. As you can see, the \\'08 recession was a catalyst for a 200-basis-point increase in at-home eating occasions, from 80% to 82% over the course of four years. Importantly, that rate held steady long after the recession ended, even when the economy returned to growth and employment hit record levels. With the COVID-19 disruption, we\\'ve already seen another 200-basis-point increase to 84% in the four months from March to June 2020., Recession impact,\\nEating habits, Basis points, Employment, Economic growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, History as a guide, the increased percentage of at-home eating occasions should persist even when economic growth returns. And as Slide 21 shows, as consumers are saving money in their food budgets, they are using their dollars and time differently. They\\'re preparing to be at home for an extended period of time. Consumers are investing in their houses, their home gyms, their entertainment systems and their kitchens., Consumer behavior,\\nSavings, Food budgets, Home preparation, Investments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the chart on the right, you can see that consumers are also spending more time cooking. Data is showing that consumers are tackling more complex mediums. In other words, they\\'re upgrading their culinary skills. We don\\'t expect these upgrades to homes, at-home entertainment, kitchens and cooking skills to go away anytime soon., Consumer behavior,\\nCooking skills, Home upgrades, At-home entertainment, Kitchen improvements, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, This all leads to one conclusion: more time at home, and, as a result, more consumption of food at home. The pivot to remote work is also a meaningful development. The significant workplace disruption we\\'ve experienced over the past several months has given way to a new normal remote workforce. The chart on the left of Slide 22 shows how even baseline projections see office vacancies remaining elevated over the coming years., More time at home, Consumption of food at home, Remote work, Office vacancies, Baseline\\nprojections, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Furthermore, on the right, we can see how remote workforce adoption has significantly increased. More working from home means more lunch is eaten at home and real opportunity for a portfolio like ours. And while we\\'re well past the initial spike of stock-up behavior when COVID first emerged in the U.S. in March, at-home eating occasions have remained elevated, even increasing over the most recent two weeks of data., Remote workforce\\nadoption, More lunch eaten at home, At-home eating occasions, Stock-up behavior, Elevated office\\nvacancies, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As the chart on Slide 23 shows, we\\'re continuing to see a double-digit percent increase in total industry sales at retail versus the prior year. During our first quarter, food and beverage industry sales rose an impressive 14%. While we don\\'t know exactly how these growth rates will trend going forward, we do know that we\\'re entering the cold and flu season and that winter weather could limit the appeal of outdoor restaurant dining in many parts of the country. All of these factors give us reason to believe that the elevated levels of at-home eating should persist., Industry sales, Total industry sales, Food and beverage industry sales, Cold and flu\\nseason, Elevated levels of at-home eating, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit. Let\\'s start with Slide 24. Total at-home meals have increased almost 6% in the three months ending July 2020. That\\'s almost seven billion meals., Total at-home meals, Increase in at-home meals, Benefit of Conagra, Slide 24, July 2020, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, When you take a closer look at this growth by daypart, the increases in meals and dollars are skewing toward lunch and dinner. And as you know, Conagra is well-developed in both of these dayparts. The chart on the right shows that, in fact, our portfolio overindexes in dinner and is almost at parity for lunch compared to the overall mix. And whether a consumer wants to cook from scratch to put those newly developed culinary skills to the test, or heat, and eat, Conagra\\'s diverse portfolio can deliver a solution for every need in every daypart., Lunch, Dinner,\\nDaypart, Consumer behavior, Conagra\\'s portfolio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, So we are very well-positioned for when and how people are eating more at home. On Slide 25, you can see the benefits. Over 80% of our categories have been growing in line or faster than the industry. And as I mentioned earlier, we\\'ve been gaining share within those categories., More at-home eating,\\nBenefits of Conagra, Growth in categories, Share gain, Slide 25, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, This is further demonstrated by Slide 26, which shows we\\'re attracting new buyers at a faster rate than any of our peers. Slide 27 shows that the buyers we\\'re attracting overindexed to the coveted millennial and Gen X generations. As you might expect, we\\'re seeing substantial millennial expansion in frozen, but, just as importantly, we\\'re seeing their expansion in snacks and staples as well. Because of this, we\\'re creating the groundwork for future growth above the category and above our peers., Attracting new\\nbuyers, Slide 26, Buyers attracted, Millennial expansion, Gen X generations, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re attracting younger generations and building superior consumer lifetime value. And not only are more consumers trying our products, they\\'re liking them and coming back for more. Take a look at the chart on Slide 28. New trier repeat rates for our consumers, whose first trial was in March or April, have remained steady at above 50%., Attracting younger\\ngenerations, Consumer lifetime value, New trier repeat rates, Slide 28, March or April, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, That stickiness can be seen further in the chart on Slide 29. Not only are repeat rates sustaining, but the depth of repeat is improving. More consumers are choosing to repurchase a Conagra product two or more times compared to where we were a year ago. When you compare us to our peers, we are at the front of the pack., Stickiness, Repeat\\nrates, Depth of repeat, Slide 29, Peer comparison, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 30 shows that we rank above nearly all of our peers in the total percentage of repeat purchasers, demonstrating the improved stickiness of our brand loyalty. So in summary, executing our disciplined Conagra Way playbook over the last five years has grown our portfolio, grown our capabilities and positioned us to meet the evolving needs of our consumers while earning the confidence of our customers. We believe that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time as consumers seek affordable and convenient meals that meet the needs of their new normal, and we are confident that Conagra is well-positioned to see sustained benefit. And with that, I\\'ll turn it over to Dave., Stickiness, Brand\\nloyalty, Growth of portfolio, Capabilities, Consumer needs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I\\'ll walk through our first-quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for questions. Let\\'s look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, we started fiscal \\'21 on a strong note., Financial\\nperformance, First-quarter results, Outlook, Slide 33, Questions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Elevated demand across our retail segments, coupled with effective execution, enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, profitability, free cash flow, and deleveraging. Compared to the same period a year ago, net sales and organic net sales for the first quarter were up 12.1% and 15%, respectively. Adjusted gross margin increased 244 basis points to 30.7%. Adjusted operating margin increased 450 basis points versus the same period a year ago, reaching 20.2% for the quarter., Elevated demand, Net\\nsales, Organic net sales, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted operating margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted EBITDA increased 34.5% to $647 million, and adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70, exceeding our first-quarter guidance. Slide 34 outlines the drivers of our first-quarter net sales versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the 15% increase in organic net sales was driven by a double-digit increase in volume, as well as favorable impacts from price/mix. Favorable pricing and sales mix both contributed to the growth in the quarter., Adjusted EBITDA,\\nAdjusted EPS, Net sales, Organic net sales, Price/mix, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Price/mix also included a benefit of approximately 70 basis points from a favorable change in estimate associated with a prior-period trade expense accrual. The organic net sales increase more than offset headwinds from divestitures and foreign exchange. As we pointed out in the past, the impact from divestitures continues to diminish sequentially as we anniversary the divestiture closing dates. Including the impact of the recently announced divestiture of HK Anderson, the full-year impact of divestitures is expected to approximate 100 basis points., Price/mix, Organic\\nnet sales, Divestitures, Foreign exchange, Full-year impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Slide 35. You\\'ll find a summary of net sales by segment for the first quarter. We saw continued strong growth in each of the company\\'s three retail segments on both a reported and organic basis. The net sales increase was primarily driven by consumers increasing their at-home food consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which benefited our three retail segments but negatively impacted the foodservice segment., Net sales, Retail\\nsegments, COVID-19 pandemic, Foodservice segment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In the quarter, our grocery & snacks segment reported organic net sales growth of 20.7%. This segment benefited as consumers continue to purchase convenient, shelf-stable products to enhance their at-home eating experience. Segment growth in shipments this quarter exceeded growth in consumption as retailers began rebuilding inventories on brands, such as Hunt\\'s, PAM, Duncan Hines, and Vlasic. The refrigerated & frozen segment also experienced strong growth in the quarter., Grocery & snacks\\nsegment, Organic net sales growth, Segment growth, Shipments, Inventory rebuilding, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The 19% increase in organic net sales is a testament to our innovation and modernization efforts and the role our portfolio plays in meeting the needs of today\\'s consumers. This segment also experienced shipment growth greater than consumption growth in the quarter, primarily as a result of Birds Eye. As Sean mentioned, we increased capacity in frozen vegetables during the quarter, enabling retailers to start replenishing their inventories. The international segment\\'s 13.1% organic net sales growth came in stronger than we forecasted with each of the segment\\'s regions posting growth higher than projected, primarily from COVID-related demand., Innovation and\\nmodernization efforts, Portfolio, Shipment growth, Capacity increase, International segment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our foodservice segment reported a 20.3% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by a volume decrease of 24.2% due to lower restaurant traffic. This marks an improvement from last quarter as some restaurant traffic began to rebound. Slide 36 outlines the drivers of the 450 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the first quarter. Our margin levers, such as realized productivity, price/mix, operating leverage, and synergies, drove a 610-basis-point increase in the quarter., Organic net sales\\ndecline, Volume decrease, Adjusted operating margin expansion, Margin levers, Realized productivity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The specific drivers of this increase are: supply chain realized productivity of 290 basis points, price/mix of 250 basis points, cost of goods sold synergy of 90 basis points, and operating leverage of 60 basis points. Also, the net impact of divestitures, FX, and other items negatively impacted operating margin by 80 basis points. Cost of goods sold inflation was approximately 3.1% in the quarter, which negatively impacted gross margin by 220 basis points. We incurred approximately $34 million in cost of goods sold directly related to our COVID-19 response which negatively impacted gross margin by 150 basis points., Supply chain realized\\nproductivity, Price/mix, Cost of goods sold synergy, Operating leverage, Net impact of divestitures,\\nFX, and other items, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our A&P rate was favorable by 20 basis points in the quarter due to the favorable sales leverage. As on a dollar basis, we spent approximately the same amount as last year\\'s first quarter. Finally, our SG&A rate was favorable by 190 basis points. Approximately 160 basis points was related to the combination of fixed-cost leverage on higher net sales and reduced spending related to COVID-19 as employees worked from home and did not travel., A&P rate, SG&A rate,\\nSales leverage, Fixed-cost leverage, COVID-19 impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The remaining 30-basis-point improvement was driven by synergies, partially offset by normal SG&A inflation and increases in stock-based compensation expense. We have certainly seen a margin benefit driven by the current environment, but it\\'s also clear to see that we have made great progress improving the underlying operating margin of the business. Slide 37 shows our adjusted operating profit and margin summary by segment in the first quarter. Our total company-adjusted operating profit increased 44.2% to $541 million in the quarter., Synergies, SG&A\\ninflation, Stock-based compensation expense, Adjusted operating profit, Margin summary, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Importantly, all four of our segments reported margin expansion in the quarter. These results demonstrate the tremendous operating margin improvement in our domestic retail and international segments. While the foodservice segment saw a decline in operating profit dollars, the segment reported a 28-basis-point increase in adjusted operating margin. This was aided by lower inventory write-offs and less trade spending in the quarter., Margin expansion,\\nOperating profit dollars, Adjusted operating margin, Inventory write-offs, Trade spending, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 38 highlights that our adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70 in the quarter, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion. Turning to Slide 39. You will see a summary of our synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition in fiscal \\'19. After exceeding our fiscal \\'20 goal of $180 million, we have continued our strong synergy progress in the beginning of fiscal \\'21., Adjusted EPS, Net\\nsales increase, Margin expansion, Synergy capture, Fiscal \\'20 goal, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In Q1, we captured an incremental $35 million in savings, bringing total cumulative synergies through the end of the first quarter to $219 million. To date, the majority of our synergies have been in SG&A, and we expect the majority of the remaining synergies to be reflected in cost of goods sold. We\\'re very pleased with our progress and are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitment. Slide 40 shows the strong progress we\\'ve made to improve our balance sheet and cash flow., Synergies, Cumulative\\nsynergies, SG&A, Cost of goods sold, Balance sheet and cash flow, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal \\'19 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal \\'21, we have reduced total gross debt by more than $1.9 billion, resulting in total net debt of $9.2 billion. As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.7 times, down from four times at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal \\'20. Given our income, we are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6 times by the third quarter of fiscal \\'21. In addition, we remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings., Gross debt reduction,\\nNet debt, Net leverage ratio, Investment-grade credit ratings, Targeted leverage ratio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Also, our cash flow remains very strong. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operating activities increased $78 million or 37% compared to the prior year. At the same time, we increased our investment in the business by increasing capex by $39 million or 36%. Supply chain investments and cost savings and capacity projects made up most of our year-over-year spend as we continue to optimize our network and drive brand growth., Cash flow, Operating\\nactivities, Capex, Supply chain investments, Brand growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This has led to our free cash flow increasing $39 million, 38% to last year\\'s first quarter. As a result of our strong cash flows and progress reducing debt, we have greater financial flexibility to both invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. This, coupled with consistent successful execution of our strategic priorities and our ongoing confidence in the long-term strength of the business, led our board to approve a 29% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share or $1.10 per share on an annualized basis. This action is consistent with our commitment to maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation., Free cash flow, Debt\\nreduction, Dividend increase, Capital allocation, Strategic priorities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As we return cash to shareholders, we are also increasing our investments in the business, as evidenced by the 36% increase in Q1 capex I just mentioned. Turning to Slide 42. You will find a summary of our outlook. As you\\'ve heard both Sean and me share this morning, we believe there is much to look forward to in the quarters ahead., Investments in the\\nbusiness, Capex increase, Outlook, Shareholder returns, Business growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, However, the dynamics surrounding COVID-19 continue to make forecasting with specificity a challenge. What we can share is that we anticipate a continuation of elevated retail demand throughout the second quarter. We are, therefore, providing second-quarter guidance, as noted in the release and on this slide. We expect organic net sales growth of plus 6% to plus 8% in the second quarter., COVID-19 dynamics,\\nRetail demand, Second-quarter guidance, Organic net sales growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect adjusted operating margin in the second quarter to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. Relative to Q1 operating margin, we expect less operating leverage benefit, and we expect to increase our marketing support, both above the line and below the line. We believe there are opportunities to increase brand-building investments where capacity permits. Given these operating margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver second-quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.70 to $0.74., Adjusted operating\\nmargin, Marketing support, Brand-building investments, Below-the-line items, Adjusted diluted EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect to reach our leverage target of 3.5 to 3.6 times by the third quarter of this fiscal year. Of course, our ability to achieve these targets assumes continued performance end to end by our supply chain. Finally, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal \\'22 targets this morning. Note that the impact of the HK Anderson divestiture is small enough that we will not be adjusting our fiscal \\'22 EPS targets for the divestiture., Leverage target,\\nSupply chain performance, Fiscal \\'22 targets, HK Anderson divestiture, EPS targets, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2021, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. I\\'ll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions., Conclusion, Remarks,\\nQuestions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy., Good morning, Fiscal\\n2020 earnings call, Safety and health, Conagra Brands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, On today\\'s call, we\\'re going to address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results, our expectations for fiscal 2021 and our perspective on why Conagra is uniquely positioned to succeed in this new environment. But first, I want to provide some context around what has brought us to this point., Fiscal 2020 results,\\nFiscal 2021 expectations, Conagra\\'s position, Context, New environment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Over the past five years, we have been purposefully architecting one of the largest transformations in the food industry. When we embarked on this process, we made major strategic decisions on where to compete and how to win. After decades as a food conglomerate, we transformed into a pure play branded food company with a portfolio focused on competing in three domains: frozen, snacks and staples., Food industry transformation, strategic decisions, portfolio focus, competing\\ndomains, company transformation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We committed to perpetually reshaping our portfolio for better growth and better margins, and established a disciplined approach rooted in a playbook that we call the Conagra Way. This relentlessly principle-based playbook is filled with repeatable and scalable processes that focus on modernizing our iconic brands through superior food, contemporary packaging and strong, consistent marketing investment. The Conagra Way is not just a way to build brands, but an operating model that has helped cultivate our agile, motivated and highly energized culture., Portfolio reshaping, disciplined approach, Conagra Way, brand modernization,\\ncultural cultivation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As I\\'ll describe in more detail in a moment, fiscal 2020 saw unprecedented performance as we built upon the extraordinary progress we have made over the past five years. We further strengthened our business, including getting legacy Pinnacle back on track, and delivered strong financial results. During the fourth quarter in particular our transformation was put to the test, and you are seeing the fruits of our labor., Fiscal 2020 performance, business strengthening, legacy Pinnacle, financial\\nresults, fourth quarter test, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our modernized portfolio and agile culture enabled us to respond to the increased consumer demand driven by COVID-19. At this point, the degree to which demand will return to historical norms is still uncertain and the timing of the changes in consumer demand is also uncertain. However, we believe that demand will likely remain elevated in the near term given both consumer perceptions about returning to work and eating outside the home as well as the fact that consumers are discovering and rediscovering the pleasures, conveniences and tremendous value proposition of dining at home., Portfolio response, consumer demand, COVID-19 impact, near-term outlook, cultural\\nvalue proposition, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dave will cover the financials in more detail, but I want to let you know that we continue to be on track to deliver our fiscal 2022 algorithm, and we remain committed to achieving our leverage target of 3.5 times to 3.6 times by the end of fiscal 2021., Fiscal 2022 algorithm, leverage target, financial commitment, end of fiscal 2021, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we\\'ll detail today, we believe our portfolio is optimally positioned to succeed in the new normal. We are focused on making the right investments to ensure that we can continue to safely and reliably meet consumers\\' needs in fiscal \\'21 and the longer term. In today\\'s presentation, we will cover our business update, the behavioral shifts we have seen and how Conagra is well positioned to benefit from these shifts and what we expect going forward in terms of our near-term outlook and the opportunity to create long-term value., Portfolio positioning, investment priorities, consumer needs, near-term outlook,\\nlong-term value creation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Beginning with our business update. Before I get into the numbers, I would like to recognize that our extraordinary results have only been possible because of the thousands of hardworking Conagra team members on the front lines across North America. Here at Conagra, we talk about infusing a refuse to lose attitude, and never before have we seen our team make such extraordinary efforts. The team\\'s commitment has enabled us to meet the elevated demand from our customers and the communities we serve and deliver the strong results that we are announcing today. I couldn\\'t be more proud of all that they\\'ve accomplished. To all of our team members, thank you. Great job all around., Business update, team recognition, demand fulfillment, customer and community\\nservice, pride and appreciation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, During the fourth quarter, we experienced significant growth across our core operating metrics, including 21.5% growth in organic net sales and a 108.3% growth in adjusted EPS. These results helped to contribute to our rapid progress in reducing our leverage, and I\\'m proud to say that we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 4.0 times, down from 4.8 times in the third quarter. As you can see on slide 9, our growth was not confined to one area, but was driven by strong retail sales across our portfolio, spanning staples, frozen and snacks. Our strong growth in e-commerce continued to accelerate both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we\\'ve done over the past several years to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly paid off. As consumers increasingly adopt online grocery shopping, our share of e-commerce sales has steadily increased., Core operating metrics growth, leverage reduction, retail sales, e-commerce growth, share\\nof e-commerce sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 11 highlights that our disciplined approach to innovation is clearly working. Our absolute sales on new innovation introduced this year increased 43% compared to our innovation slate of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, we stated at our initial Investor Day that our goal was to have 15% of total sales coming from products launched within the past three years. Well, today I\\'m proud to say that we\\'ve consistently performed above that level. In a few minutes, we\\'ll provide you some of the new innovation that we have in store for fiscal 2021 as we seek to build upon this success., Disciplined innovation, new product sales growth, innovation slate, total sales\\npercentage, new innovation for fiscal 2021, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we\\'ve discussed previously, frozen is an increasingly important domain for consumers, especially in today\\'s environment. For the fourth quarter, total Conagra frozen retail sales grew 26.2% over last year, with strong growth across each frozen category, including single serve meals, vegetables, multi-serve meals and plant based meat alternatives. And as slide 13 shows, as we grew we also gained share in the important frozen meals category during the quarter, continuing a trend we\\'ve seen for some time now. The Conagra Way playbook continues to pay off., Frozen retail sales growth, category growth, share gain, frozen meals category, Conagra\\nWay playbook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And while the trends have remained strong, there\\'s even more opportunity, particularly in frozen vegetables. Birds Eye faced some unique dynamics in the quarter. As I said earlier, the category remained extremely relevant for consumers. We continue to see robust demand for frozen vegetables, and our retail sales up 26.5% during the quarter. Importantly, Birds Eye holds the top position in category share and has 2 times the share of the next branded player. Given the incredible surge in demand we experienced during the fourth quarter and our number one brand position, we hit a ceiling on capacity., Birds Eye sales growth, frozen vegetable demand, category relevance, brand share,\\ncapacity constraints, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Furthermore, we made the decision to temporarily close a plant during the quarter due to COVID-19 which further constrained capacity. The good news is, the plant is safely back up and running flat out. In addition, we have made the strategic decision to bring on more external partners to fulfill demand and rebuild inventory. These investments in our supply chain will allow us to efficiently meet the elevated demand we are seeing today and expect to see going forward. This is an important example of that investment, and I will expand on this in a few minutes., Capacity constraints, plant closure, supply chain investments, demand fulfillment,\\nexternal partnership, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to snacks. Recall that our snacks business over-indexes to convenience stores which saw softer traffic due to COVID-19 during our Q4. Also, the seeds category was impacted by the postponement, and in many areas of the country cancellation, of baseball and softball seasons. Baseball and seeds go hand in hand, and the loss of these opportunities had a negative impact on the category. Even despite these discrete headwinds, the snacks business delivered a terrific 20.1% year-over-year growth and a 26.4% growth on a two year basis., Snacks business growth, convenience store traffic, seeds category impact, baseball and\\nsoftball seasons cancellation, snacks business performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And on slide 16 you can see our performance in staples, a category that is more relevant than ever before. Our total staples business grew an incredible 46.3% for the quarter. The six brands to the right are our largest staples brands, accounting for over 50% of our staples sales at retail pre COVID, and each experienced considerable growth in the quarter. These businesses are proving to be a distinct benefit to our portfolio., Staples business growth, brand performance, category relevance, portfolio benefits, slide\\n16 performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, So while we\\'re pleased with our results for the quarter and the year, we are particularly excited about what the quarter has taught us about the opportunity that lies ahead as consumers have shifted their behaviors and eating habits., Consumer behavior, eating habits, quarterly results, yearly performance, opportunity\\nahead, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 18 shows some of the key ways in which we\\'re seeing consumers\\' behavior shift in response to COVID-19. Many consumers are rediscovering the enjoyment associated with at home eating, whether it\\'s making fun baked goods, cooking with the family or enjoying a movie night with some snacks. Numerous consumers are also discovering new things about food during this time. Many are learning how to truly cook for the first time or discovering they can recreate restaurant favorites at home. We believe that many of these activities have staying power and are likely to persist even after a post COVID world in whatever new normal we settle into. We also believe our broad and refreshed portfolio of innovative products is best suited to meet consumers\\' needs as they engage in these food behaviors., Consumer behavior shift, at-home eating, rediscovering enjoyment, new food discoveries,\\nstaying power, portfolio suitability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And slide 19 shows the strong growth during the quarter across our iconic brands, demonstrating how well suited our portfolio is to meet these behaviors. Our ability to meet the changing consumer needs is balanced across our three domains. Slide 20 shows how household penetration grew during the quarter in staples, snacks and frozen., Strong growth, iconic brands, portfolio suitability, changing consumer needs, household\\npenetration, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And, as we\\'ve been able to modernize and innovate our iconic brands we are attracting younger consumers. Slide 21 shows that new consumers to our brands over-index in the younger millennial and Gen X market segments. Driving new trial is always a key focus for us. The investments that we\\'ve made over the past five years in updating our food with bold on trend flavors and modern food attributes were promised on the belief that if we can get people to try our food, they will come back for more, and that is exactly what\\'s happening., Attracting younger consumers, new trial focus, investments in modernization, bold flavors\\nand food attributes, consumer repeat business, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 22 shows the continuously improving repeat rates from consumers who tried our foods for the first time in March when the pandemic really started to accelerate in the US. The improved repeat rates are broad based across many of our iconic brands. Importantly, when we attract new triers to our brands, they are coming back to purchase again more often than they did a year ago. It\\'s worth noting that this trend holds true for the big three Pinnacle brands, validating our work over the last 12 months., Repeat rates, consumer trial, brand repeat business, improved repeat rates, trend\\nvalidation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And slide 24 shows we\\'re not just seeing an increase in repeat buyers, but we\\'re seeing an increase in the frequency at which they return. Customers are not just coming back for more; they\\'re coming back time and time again. And [Technical Issues] to the strength of our trial and repeat results, on an absolute basis, we are outperforming our peers in terms of new trials., Increase in repeat buyers, frequency of return, trial and repeat results, absolute\\nperformance, technical issues, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s take frozen as an example. Slide 25 demonstrates how our Banquet, Healthy Choice and Marie Callender\\'s brands are leading frozen single serve peers in new buyer acquisition. And, as slide 26 shows, these new frozen buyers are disproportionately coming from the millennial and Gen X market segments, similar to what we see in total Conagra trends. And like the total Conagra trends we discussed, not only are we attracting new buyers, but we\\'re seeing higher repeat rates in our frozen segment than our peers. Similarly, despite the supply constraints we faced that I noted earlier, Birds Eye continued to lead its category in terms of both new consumers and repeat purchases compared to peers during the quarter., Banquet, Healthy Choice, Marie Callender\\'s, frozen single serve, millennial and Gen X\\nmarket segments, supply constraints, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, All of these trends have important implications for our value creation opportunity as we look ahead. We believe the dynamic environment in which we find ourselves provides a unique window of opportunity to maintain the current momentum such that we maximize our long-term value creation potential. To make that possible, we need to make investments focused on doing everything in our power to ensure the physical availability of our products., Momentum, value creation opportunity, investments, product availability, long-term\\npotential, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Instead of choosing to simply accept the elevated demand as transitory and focus on maximizing near-term margins, we have chosen to bolster the long-term earnings potential of our Company. We plan to accomplish this through investing in the key areas you see on this slide which include increasing capacity, both internal and external; innovation; inventory; e-commerce; and safety. By investing behind today\\'s elevated trial rates, we will build relationships with new consumers and maximize consumer conversion. The lifetime value of these consumers easily justifies these actions., Investing, capacity increase, innovation, inventory, e-commerce, safety, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 31 shows some highlights of our fiscal \\'21 innovation slate. Some of these items began launching in Q4, and we will continue to roll out these new products throughout the year. Overall, we are confident that the investments we are making will produce strong ROIs. They will also maximize our long-term value creation and ultimately shareholder value., Innovation slate, new product launches, ROIs, long-term value creation, shareholder\\nvalue, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to our guidance on slide 32. We know that you would like as much information about our expectations for the year as possible. Given the very dynamic nature of the external environment, forecasting the full year right now is more difficult than normal. As of today, therefore, we\\'re providing Q1 guidance. We hope that when we report Q1 results, we will be in a position to give you a further update on our outlook. While we don\\'t expect the next few months to drive as much change as the past few, we expect to know a lot more by then., Guidance, external environment, Q1 guidance, Q1 results, future outlook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dave is going to go into more depth regarding the guidance, so I\\'ll just hit the highlights here. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect to deliver organic net sales growth of 10% to 13%, adjusted operating margin of 17% to 17.5%, adjusted EPS of $0.54 to $0.59. As I said earlier, we remain on track to reach our fiscal 2022 targets outlined on this slide as well as our deleveraging ratio., Organic net sales growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EPS, fiscal 2022 targets,\\ndeleveraging ratio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Before we open up for Q&A, I\\'d like to say a few words about diversity and inclusion at Conagra., Diversity, inclusion, Conagra, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We are deeply saddened by the recent events we\\'ve seen unfold across our nation. It\\'s heartbreaking and unacceptable that racism and racial injustices continue to exist around the world. Our goal at Conagra is to work together in a constructive manner where everyone has a voice and has the opportunity to be heard., Racism, racial injustices, Conagra, nation, voice, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, D&I is not only part of our value system at Conagra, it\\'s a business imperative. We serve a wide cross section of the population, and therefore it makes clear sense our organization represents the consumers we serve. D&I has always been a focus for Conagra Brands. But like many others, we can and we\\'ll up our game. We are working with an external diversity and inclusion consultancy to help us identify specific opportunities that will have the most impact. We\\'re also hosting listening sessions with employees throughout the organization., D&I, value system, business imperative, consumers, opportunities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Overall, we are determined to be part of the solution, and we look forward to continuing to share reports of our progress along the way., determined, solution, progress, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Before I discuss the details of the quarter, I want to take a moment to wish you all well. I hope you and your families are continuing to stay healthy and safe., wish, health, safety, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll kick off this portion of the call by pointing out a few highlights for the quarter and the full fiscal year which are captured on slide 34. Overall, we\\'re very pleased with our performance for Q4 and the fiscal year. As Sean discussed earlier, in the fourth quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented demand in our retail businesses, which more than offset the softer foodservice demand. This increased retail demand, combined with our strong execution, enabled us to exceed the most recent full year fiscal \\'20 guidance for total Company sales, profit and free cash flow metrics., Q4, fiscal year, COVID-19, retail, foodservice, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The key takeaways for Q4 and fiscal \\'20 are: organic net sales increased 21.5% in the fourth quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Adjusted operating margin increased almost 400 basis points for the fourth quarter and over 100 basis points for the full year. Adjusted EPS more than doubled in the fourth quarter and grew 13% for the full year. And adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6% for the full year to just under $2.3 billion, helping to reduce the leverage ratio to 4.0 times at the end of fiscal \\'20., Q4, fiscal year, organic net sales, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Let\\'s start with the net sales bridge on slide 35. As you can see, our 21.5% organic net sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by 21% volume growth, with price/mix contributing 0.5 percentage point. Divestitures were a 310 basis point headwind in the quarter. This headwind will diminish sequentially as we continue to anniversary the divestiture closing dates going forward. Foreign exchange was a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter, with the weakening of the Mexican peso representing about two-thirds of the headwind. This was a bit higher than we were expecting for Q4. Finally, the 53rd week added 810 basis points for the quarter, which was more of a net sales tailwind than we expected due to the elevated COVID related demand at the end of the quarter, taking total reported net sales growth to plus 25.8% for Q4 versus a year ago., net sales bridge, organic net sales growth, volume growth, price/mix, divestitures, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to slide 36, you see our sales summary by segment. In the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, we saw strong growth across our three retail focused businesses. Our Grocery & Snacks segment reported very strong organic net sales growth of 40.4%. The grocery business proved to be a significant asset as consumers reengaged with convenient shelf-stable products to facilitate and enhance the at home eating experience., retail focused, organic net sales growth, Grocery & Snacks, fiscal year, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued to perform very well in the quarter. The segment reported organic net sales growth in each quarter of this fiscal year and has now had positive organic net sales growth in 11 of the last 12 fiscal quarters. This consistency shows that our modernization efforts have been working and are sustainable., Refrigerated & Frozen, organic net sales growth, quarterly performance, modernization\\nefforts, consistency, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The International segment\\'s 19.8% organic net sales growth was due to strong growth in Canada and better than expected growth in the Mexican and export businesses due to the pandemic. Foodservice reported an organic net sales decline of 31.5%, which was better than expected as many restaurants continued to serve customer consumers with curbside pickup, drive-through or partial capacity., International, Canada, Mexico, foodservice, decline, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 37 outlines the progress we\\'ve made on our Q4 adjusted operating margin versus the prior year. Throughout the quarter, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and COGS synergies continued to be effective. We also benefited from value-driven operating leverage in the quarter, approximating 100 basis points. These tailwinds were partially offset by increased COVID related costs, dilution from significant Foodservice operating margin declines and a 170 basis point headwind from inflation, resulting in a net gross margin improvement of approximately 110 basis points., Q4 adjusted operating margin, gross margin expansion, realized productivity, pricing,\\nmix, COGS synergies, value-driven operating leverage, COVID related costs, inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Given the already increased demand for food at home, we chose to pull back a bit on A&P in the quarter. That, coupled with increased net sales, drove a 100 basis point improvement to operating margin. While adjusted SG&A expense increased 5.7% in Q4 versus a year ago, net sales grew much faster, resulting in a 180 basis point tailwind to operating margin., t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to slide 38, you can see that our adjusted operating profit was $562 million in the quarter, an increase of 63.5%. Adjusted operating margin increased just below 400 basis points to 17.1%. This chart clearly summarizes the outstanding operating margin improvement during Q4 in our domestic retail and international segments. This was partially offset by our Foodservice segment, which had significantly lower operating profit due to the 32% organic net sales decline, unfavorable fixed cost leverage on that sales decline, higher inventory write-offs and higher input costs., t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to slide 39, we\\'ve summarized the various drivers of adjusted diluted EPS in Q4 versus a year ago. As you can see, our adjusted EPS increased $0.39 in the quarter, representing growth of over 100% from the same quarter last year. While the increase in EPS is primarily driven by the increase in operating profit associated with the net sales and margin increases, we also had higher income from Ardent Mills as COVID related demand was a net benefit. We also estimate a $0.05 per share benefit from the 53rd week., t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to slide 42. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in Q2 fiscal \\'19 through the end of the fourth quarter and fiscal \\'20, we\\'ve reduced net debt by nearly $2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we reduced gross debt by $271 million and net debt by $725 million, improving our leverage ratio to 4.0 times at the end of Q4, down from 4.8 times at the end of Q3., t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, What\\'s not shown on this slide but is important to note is that we improved the funded status of our pension plans during fiscal \\'20 by $80 million, with the total underfunded status declining to approximately $50 million. For context, the pension plans\\' underfunded status were approximately $565 million at the end of fiscal \\'17, a reduction of over $500 million. This significant improvement was driven by planned pension contributions, lump sum payments to participants and actual returns on plan assets exceeding expectations., t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 4, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, everyone. That concludes my comments. I\\'ll now pass it back to Sean., Pass,\\nComments, Sean, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are staying safe during this unprecedented time., Thanks,\\nGood morning, Fiscal 2020, Safety, Conagra Brands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Today, I\\'m going to address two main topics; our response to COVID-19 and its impact on our business as well as the underlying trends that we saw in the third quarter, which ended just before the impact of COVID-19 started. Rest assured that we\\'re taking all necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees and our ability to safely and reliably meet consumers\\' needs. For the most recent status of our efforts to respond to COVID-19, please visit conagrabrands.com., Response, COVID-19, Business, Safety, Precautions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll continue to provide updated information on our site as the situation evolves. As I\\'ll describe in more detail in a moment, we\\'ve taken a number of steps to ensure our supply chain continues to operate well. We\\'re incredibly proud of our teams who have been producing and delivering without disruption. While we all remain focused on executing through this rapidly evolving situation, I don\\'t want to lose sight of the fact that we\\'ve made significant progress against the operational objectives we established for fiscal 2020., Supply\\nchain, Operational objectives, Progress, Execution, Fiscal 2020, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In many ways, our progress against these objectives is enhancing our ability to navigate this crisis. Recall at the outset of fiscal 2020, we set out to execute on integration, synergy capture and deleveraging, drive strong consumption growth in Frozen and Snacks, improved trends in Hunt\\'s tomatoes and Chef Boyardee and the trend in the Legacy Pinnacle business and drive innovation and growth in Gardein. I\\'m proud to say that through the third quarter, we remained squarely on track with all of these objectives., Progress, Integration, Synergy capture, Consumption growth, Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And from a financial standpoint, the third quarter results are in line with the expectations we provided at CAGNY. As we previously described, industry softness, which started in December in foodservice and pivoted to retail in January put pressure on consumption trends in several of our key categories, which more than offset share gains., Industry\\nsoftness, Consumption trends, Share gains, Financial standpoint, CAGNY, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As expected, consumption trends recovered in February, prior to COVID-19 impact. It\\'s important to keep in mind that our third quarter ended on February 23rd. At that time, there were very few reported cases in the U.S., and notably no widespread change in behavior., Consumption trends, COVID-19 impact, Third quarter, Behavior, Recovery, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we all know, that has changed significantly in recent weeks. From the second week of our fiscal fourth quarter to-date, we\\'ve experienced the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 as consumers have stocked up on food and shifted rapidly to eating more at home. Given the quality of our brands and the categories we participate in, Conagra is well-positioned to serve consumers during this time of disruption and extraordinary demand., COVID-19\\nimpact, Consumer behavior, Home cooking, Brand quality, Disruption, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our team is hard at work, in close coordination with our customers to ensure that consumers have access to the food they need to stay safe at home. At this point, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 impact is still uncertain. However, I can tell you that we expect to exceed our prior full-year guidance for total Company sales and profit metrics, assuming the end-to-end supply chain continues to operate effectively., Supply\\nchain, Sales, Profit, Customer coordination, Uncertainty, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We will provide more detail on the impact of COVID-19 in a moment, but first we would like to walk you through the highlights of the third quarter. During the third quarter, our performance was in line with the updated expectations that we provided at CAGNY. Organic net sales growth decreased 1.7% while our adjusted operating margin was 15.7% and our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.47 for the quarter., Performance, COVID-19 impact, Organic net sales growth, Operating margin, EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we noted at CAGNY, we saw category softness in January that was greater than anticipated. At the time we told you that our more recent data was improving and we expected to bounce back and that\\'s exactly what happened., Category\\nsoftness, Improvement, Data, Bounce back, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 7, Total Conagra retail sales returned to growth in the final four weeks of February and sustained a normal rate into the first week of Q4. Clearly, even before the current disruption due to COVID-19, we were well on track and had already seen the expected rebound in consumption trends. Not only did we see growth of 0.9% in the four weeks ended February 23rd but what we saw in the week ended March 1, which is in our fiscal fourth quarter, reaffirmed this return to consumption growth., Consumption trends, Retail sales, Growth, COVID-19 disruption, Track, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And, during the quarter, we continued to deliver on integration, synergies, and deleveraging. On integration, we have been converting Legacy Pinnacle plants over to SAP. And through Q3, this multi-year process has been progressing on plan. We captured $33 million in incremental synergies, increasing our total through the end of Q3 to $145 million and we made further progress on reducing our net debt position by paying down $450 million of debt during the quarter., Integration, Synergies, Deleveraging, Debt reduction, Progress, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 9 demonstrates our continued success in the important Frozen category. As both graphics demonstrate, we maintained strong growth during the quarter across our Frozen portfolio both for Total Conagra Brands and Legacy Conagra Brands. As we will discuss later in the presentation, Total Conagra\\'s Frozen growth has been driven by both Legacy Conagra and Legacy Pinnacle. Slide 10 shows the outsized performance of Conagra\\'s Frozen Meals within the category., Frozen\\ncategory, Growth, Portfolio, Performance, Meals, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Not only did we have yet another quarter of gaining share of shelf and share of sales, but we also did so at an accelerated rate. Our Snacks segment reported solid growth in the third quarter. Total Snacks were up 2.9% during the quarter and 8.7% on a two-year basis. Our results were led by our Meat Snacks and Seeds businesses which delivered growth of 8.4% and 5.9% respectively., Gaining\\nshare, Shelf share, Sales growth, Segment growth, Meat Snacks, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And as Slide 12 shows, we continued to gain share in many of our Snack categories in Q3. Another key objective for fiscal 2020 was to improve trends in Hunt\\'s tomatoes and Chef Boyardee. As you can see on Slide 13, that\\'s just what we\\'ve done., Gain\\nshare, Share trends, Hunt\\'s tomatoes, Chef Boyardee, Improved trends, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Over the five-week period ended February 23rd, Hunt\\'s tomatoes and Chef Boyardee gained 2.2% and 4.5% in dollar sales growth respectively, and both brands also grew share of retail sales over that same period as outlined on Slide 14. It\\'s worth noting that these trends for Hunt\\'s tomatoes and Chef Boyardee continued into the first week of our fiscal fourth quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19., Hunt\\'s\\ntomatoes, Chef Boyardee, Sales growth, Share trends, COVID-19 impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 15 shows a milestone for Conagra as we bend the trend on Legacy Pinnacle on both a one-year and a two-year basis. Recall that in December 2018, we outlined a number of actions that were needed to get Pinnacle back on track. We also indicated that we did not expect to see the impact of those actions until the second half of fiscal 2020, which as you can see here is exactly what has occurred., Legacy\\nPinnacle, Trend reversal, Actions taken, Second half fiscal 2020, Impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 16 shows how we\\'ve been able to bend the trend in the Big 3 Legacy Pinnacle brands by implementing the Conagra Way playbook. We started with Wish-Bone where the missteps came from several executional issues including a label change, which we quickly addressed to stabilize the brand. As a result, we saw an immediate spike in retail sales before returning to more normal levels., Bending\\ntrend, Legacy Pinnacle brands, Conagra Way playbook, Wish-Bone brand, Executional issues, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Birds Eye, which is our biggest brand, took a little longer as the playbook required us to remove lower performing SKUs, which negatively impacted sales and distribution. Notably, Birds Eye is now contributing to our growth as the innovation we launched in the first half of fiscal 2020 builds momentum with more innovation to come., Birds Eye\\nbrand, Playbook implementation, SKU removal, Innovation launch, Momentum build-up, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, With respect to Duncan Hines, we\\'ve made great progress on reframing the brand as a sweet treat but recognize that there\\'s more work to be done. We\\'re focused on introducing more on-trend innovation as we trim lower performing SKUs. While it will take time to return this brand to growth, we\\'re confident in the ongoing implementation of the Conagra Way playbook., Duncan\\nHines brand, Reframing brand, On-trend innovation, SKU trimming, Conagra Way playbook\\nimplementation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Another Legacy Pinnacle brand that has benefited from the Conagra Way is Gardein, which is accelerating at very strong rates. As a reminder, we\\'ve made significant investments to expand Gardein\\'s manufacturing capacity, which came online earlier this fiscal year. As the slide shows, the brand\\'s growth is attributed to more than just meatless burgers and includes meatless options for chicken, seafood and sausages, to name a few. As you can see, it\\'s clear that we remained on track with all our fiscal 2020 operational objectives through the third quarter., Gardein\\nbrand, Fiscal 2020 operational objectives, Meatless options, Manufacturing capacity expansion, Track\\nrecord, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now let\\'s turn to the current quarter and the balance of the year. Typically, we would be spending our time on this call reaffirming our guidance and discussing the shortlist of initiatives under way to close out the year. But this year is unprecedented and the impact of COVID-19 will be significant., COVID-19 impact, Quarterly guidance, Initiatives underway, Unprecedented times,\\nShortlist of initiatives, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let me start by saying that our top priorities right now are the health and safety of our employees as well as our ability to safely and responsibly meet customer and consumer needs. With respect to our results, the magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict. What we know to-date, the Q4 retail demand surge is significant and spans multiple retail channels, including e-commerce., Health\\nand safety of employees, Customer and consumer needs, Q4 retail demand surge, Magnitude of impact,\\nPredictability of impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, While our Foodservice segment is facing headwinds that impact is more than offset by increased demand in our Retail segments. Given the depth and breadth of our portfolio, we are well-positioned to meet this increased demand for at-home consumption. Having all these brands and capabilities under one roof is enabling us to meet a wide array of customer and consumer demands., Foodservice segment, Retail segments, Portfolio depth and breadth, Customer and consumer demands,\\nBrand capabilities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Importantly, we\\'ve been able to address this retail demand surge because of a strong business continuity plan that we were able to activate as soon as the market disruption began. I\\'m very proud of the extraordinary efforts across our Company and the way our teams have supported each other and our business all in the pursuit of ensuring that consumers are able to access food during this time., Business continuity plan, Retail demand surge, Extraordinary efforts, Consumer\\naccess to food, Team support, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We have decided to temporarily delay some Legacy Pinnacle plants SAP implementation to prioritize supplying customers with the food they require now, but our integration plans are otherwise on track. We will continue to consider and prioritize our business needs as the COVID-19 situation unfolds., Legacy\\nPinnacle plants, SAP implementation, Customer supply, Business needs, COVID-19 situation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And I\\'d like to take a minute to talk a bit more about the Conagra team, and in particular, to highlight the exceptional work of our supply chain team. While demand has sharply increased, our order fulfillment rates so far in Q4 has remained above 90%. This is a testament to the systems we have in place and the commitment of our people. This has been remarkable to see and I\\'d like to thank our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Dave Biegger and the entire Supply Chain team for their incredible efforts., Conagra\\nteam, Supply chain systems, Order fulfillment rates, Exceptional work, Chief Supply Chain Officer, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our supplies of ingredients and packaging remains sufficient and we\\'ve experienced minimal disruption so far in the quarter. All of our North America manufacturing facilities are open and running at high levels of utilization and our distribution network remains fully operational. Our plants and locations have the resources and critical equipment they need to operate in full compliance with current regulations and CDC guidance., Supplies of ingredients and packaging, Minimal disruption, North America\\nmanufacturing facilities, Distribution network, Compliance with regulations and CDC guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And I\\'m proud of the remarkable level of collaboration among our sales, customer order management, and supply chain teams. That collaboration, along with the work we\\'re doing with customers is enabling us to ensure we are able to supply consumers with the food they need; great job all around. Although providing specific Q4 guidance is not possible due to the uncertainty of this situation, we do want to give you a sense of our experience so far., Collaboration among teams, Supply chain management, Customer supply, Q4 guidance, Uncertainty of\\nsituation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The chart on Slide 20 shows what we\\'ve seen in the market to-date. You can see that there has been a material increase in demand the past few weeks. While some categories are benefiting more than others, all categories and all temperature states are seeing increases. In addition to a significant uptick in sales, our execution has enabled Conagra to outperform and gain share in the categories in which we compete., Market\\ndemand, Sales increase, Category performance, Execution, Share gain, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The data we\\'re showing in the chart is only measured channel data. It\\'s important to note that demand has surged broadly across retail channels, including e-commerce as well as for pickup and delivery, most of which are not reflected in this data. Similar to our measured channel retail business, our e-commerce business is also up in sales, outpacing the competition and gaining share., Taken\\ntogether, demand has surged broadly across retail channels, E-commerce business, Sales increase,\\nShare gain, Measured channel data, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter of the year. Our quarterly results were in line with our updated expectations and we remained on track with all of our fiscal 2020 operational objectives. Going forward, our teams are prioritizing health and safety, adapting well and operating effectively to ensure consumers are able to access food they need. And while this is clearly an unprecedented time, we will not lose focus on executing the Conagra Way playbook., Progress,\\nQuarterly results, Fiscal 2020 operational objectives, Health and safety, Executing Conagra Way\\nplaybook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our brand building and innovation processes remain critical pieces to our long-term success. We\\'re updating our full year guidance today to note that we now expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total Company sales and profit metrics., Brand building, Innovation processes, Full year guidance, Sales, Profit metrics, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Beyond fiscal 2020, it\\'s important to note that we are also working with customers as they reevaluate the timing of promotions and shelf resets as they look to minimize in-store disruption during this time of surging demand., Beyond\\nfiscal 2020, Working with customers, Surging demand, In-store disruption, Timing of promotions and\\nshelf resets, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, while the situation is still evolving, we believe the sharp increase in at home eating occasions is generating trial among new consumers that we did not anticipate accessing. We view this dynamic as a long-term opportunity for our portfolio overall, and in particular, our leading Frozen business., Trial\\namong new consumers, Long-term opportunity, Leading Frozen business, Evolving situation, At home\\neating occasions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe. Before I get into the details, I want to remind you that Q3 has been the first full quarter following the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As a result, Pinnacle\\'s full quarterly results are now reflected in our organic figures., Q3\\nresults, Pinnacle acquisition, Organic figures, Health and safety, Families, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll start my remarks this morning by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter, which are outlined on Slide 23. As Sean discussed, our Q3 performance was consistent with the expectations we\\'ve provided at CAGNY. This included broad-based category softness early in the quarter and a return to consumption growth in February prior to the COVID-19 related surge in demand., Performance for the quarter, Category softness, Consumption growth, COVID-19\\nrelated surge in demand, Slide 23, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I\\'ll unpack these results further in the slides to come, but overall, for the third quarter, reported net sales were down 5.6% versus the same period a year ago with organic net sales down 1.7%. The organic net sales decline was in line with the updated expectations that we provided in February., Reported\\nnet sales, Organic net sales, Third quarter results, Updated expectations, Slide presentation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted gross profit decreased 10.5% and adjusted operating profit declined 8.9%. We continued to operate efficiently from an SG&A perspective capturing strong synergies. Adjusted EBITDA, which includes equity-method investment earnings and pension and post-retirement non-service income decreased 7.1% in the quarter and adjusted diluted EPS decreased 7.8% to $0.47 for the quarter. Again, this was in line with our updated expectations., Adjusted\\ngross profit, Adjusted operating profit, SG&A efficiency, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Let\\'s jump into net sales a bit more. Slide 24 depicts the 5.6% change versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the broad-based category softness that we discussed at CAGNY drove our volume down 1.3%. Also, our price mix was unfavorable, 40 basis points, as we continued to support many of our brands with incremental promotions., Net\\nsales, Category softness, Price mix, Promotions, Slide 24, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As I mentioned on prior quarterly calls, we expect that our year-over-year change in retailer investments to be much smaller and less material in the second half of fiscal \\'20 and beyond now that this type of spending is in our base. As a result, we will no longer be breaking out that bridging item and will return to our historical approach of showing just the impact of price mix overall., Retailer\\ninvestments, Year-over-year change, Second half of fiscal \\'20 and beyond, Historical approach, Price\\nmix, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Moving to Slide 25, you can find our sales summary by segment. In the quarter, organic net sales for the Grocery & Snacks segment decreased 3.6%. The Snacks business continued to perform well. However, this segment was negatively affected by weather with a warmer than normal winter this year stacked against an abnormally cold prior year. On a reported net sales basis, divestiture activity subtracted 5.9%., Grocery &\\nSnacks segment, Organic net sales, Sales summary, Weather impact, Divestiture activity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Organic net sales for Refrigerated & Frozen increased 0.3% as the Frozen business continued to perform well behind the recent innovation launches. Importantly, as Sean mentioned, we saw frozen meals continued to gain share at an accelerated rate in the quarter. The strength in the Frozen business continued to be somewhat masked by declines in the Refrigerated business., Organic\\nnet sales, Refrigerated & Frozen segment, Frozen business, Share gain, Declines, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to our International segment, quarterly net sales and organic net sales for the segment decreased 3.2% and 1.9% respectively. Throughout the quarter, the segment continued to benefit from the growth in the Canadian Snacks business and Frozen businesses. Recall that earlier this year, we said that the business in India had a transitory headwind that would rebound in the second half and that is what we saw in Q3. These benefits were more than offset by economic challenges primarily in Mexico and certain planned value-over-volume actions., International segment, Net sales, Organic net sales, Canadian Snacks business, Frozen business, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 8% in Q3 while organic net sales decreased 2.2% as divestiture subtracted 5.8%. The organic net sales decrease was driven by volume declines of 4.6% as a result of soft industry traffic trends early in the quarter that were partially offset by a 2.4% improvement in price mix., Net\\nsales, Organic net sales, Divestiture, Volume declines, Price mix, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Slide 26, you can see the adjusted operating bridge for the quarter versus the prior year. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, input cost inflation did start to increase in Q3. In the quarter, inflation was just over 3%, which translated into a 240 basis point headwind to margin. Importantly, however, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and synergies continued to be effective in Q3., Adjusted\\noperating bridge, Input cost inflation, Gross margin expansion levers, Realized productivity,\\nPricing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The increased promotional support in the quarter partially offset these benefits, resulting in a 90 basis point improvement in gross margin. A&P had only a modest impact on margin in the quarter while reduced SG&A spend benefited our operating margin by 100 basis points during the quarter., Gross\\nmargin improvement, Promotional support, A&P impact, SG&A spend reduction, Operating margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 27 highlights the significant progress that we\\'ve made to-date on our overall synergy capture from the Pinnacle acquisition. In Q3, we realized $33 million of incremental synergies bringing our total synergy capture through the end of Q3 to $145 million. We remain on track to achieve approximately $180 million of synergies by the end of fiscal \\'20 with $20 million being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities. We also remain on track to deliver our total synergy target of $305 million, again, with $20 million of that being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities., Synergy\\ncapture, Pinnacle acquisition, Incremental synergies, Total synergy target, Reinvestment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Slide 28, you will see an outline of our adjusted operating profit and operating margin for the third quarter. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 8.9% in Q3 and our adjusted operating margin came in at 15.7%. Across our segments, realized productivity and cost synergies benefited our operating profit in the quarter. These benefits were more than offset by the impacts of higher input costs, lower organic net sales, inventory write-offs and lost profit from divested businesses., Adjusted\\noperating profit, Operating margin, Realized productivity, Cost synergies, Input costs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 29 outlines the various drivers of our Q3 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. In Q3, our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.47 decreased by $0.04 compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in adjusted operating profit and higher tax rate during the quarter more than offset the benefit from improved pension income and interest., EPS, Q3, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Operating Profit, Tax Rate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 30 summarizes Conagra\\'s net debt and cash flow information. I\\'m sure that our perspective on the balance sheet and liquidity are top of mind in these uncertain times. I\\'ll start by reminding you that we have made significant progress toward our deleveraging and free cash flow targets in recent quarters., Net Debt, Cash Flow,\\nBalance Sheet, Deleveraging, Free Cash Flow, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Since the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition through the end of Q3, we have reduced total gross debt by over $1.5 billion, improving our balance sheet and the overall health of our business. With respect to Q3, we reduced debt by $450 million, while our net debt balance at quarter end was $9.9 billion and the net debt leverage ratio was 4.8 times., Balance Sheet, Debt\\nReduction, Net Debt, Leverage Ratio, Pinnacle Acquisition, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, At the end of the third quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately 8.8 years, our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7% and approximately 92% of our total debt was fixed. Free cash flow year-to-date was $641 million, marking an improvement of over $100 million against the same period last year. We remain on schedule with our deleveraging targets and are confident we will achieve our fiscal \\'21 leverage target of 3.6 times to 3.5 times., Debt\\nMaturity, Coupon Rate, Total Debt, Free Cash Flow, Deleveraging Targets, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and we have many options for maintaining liquidity. First, we ended the quarter with $99 million of cash on hand. We expect stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and because of the increased retail demand we\\'re experiencing in light of COVID-19. Our capital allocation priorities remain constant. We are committed to maintaining our dividend, deleveraging, and maintaining a solid investment grade credit rating. Along these lines, we anticipate deleveraging further in Q4 of fiscal \\'20., Cash on Hand, Cash Flows,\\nCapital Allocation, Deleveraging, Credit Rating, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In addition to cash flow from operations, we also have a $1.6 billion fully undrawn revolving credit facility. During certain months of the year, we issued commercial paper against this revolver to fund working capital needs. We did not need to access the commercial paper markets during Q3 and we don\\'t anticipate needing access during the rest of Q4. Given our strong cash flow and borrowing capacity, we have many options available to fund upcoming debt maturities in August and October., Cash Flow, Revolving\\nCredit Facility, Commercial Paper, Debt Maturities, Borrowing Capacity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, At CAGNY last month, we discussed that we continue to explore smart divestitures that can help scope top line performance and generate cash flow to support deleveraging. By smart, we mean ensuring that any potential divestiture will deliver a valuation that exceeds our intrinsic value., Smart Divestitures, Top\\nLine Performance, Cash Flow, Deleveraging, Intrinsic Value, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In this environment, our brands are growing and playing an important role for consumers and they are generating sales and cash flow in excess of historic levels. While we continue to evaluate portfolio actions, we do not feel pressured to pursue any divestitures that are not value-creating. Now, recognizing that our new guidance isn\\'t specific, I want to give you some color on what we do know and what we don\\'t know at this point., Growth, Sales, Cash Flow,\\nPortfolio Actions, Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, What we do know is that our retail businesses have seen accelerating shipments. In our domestic retail business, which is about 80% of total Company\\'s sales, total fourth quarter to-date shipments have increased approximately 50% versus last year, similar to the most recent consumption data., Retail Business,\\nShipments, Total Sales, Domestic Retail Business, Consumption Data, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Internationally, the impact has been a bit mixed with the Canada Retail business seeing increased demand but some softness in global export. All told, quarter-to-go retail shipments are difficult to predict given the wide range of possible outcomes., International Impact,\\nCanada Retail Business, Export Demand, Quarter-to-Date Shipments, Predictability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Just as the retail businesses are seeing a surge in demand, our Foodservice business, which is about 10% of total Company sales is beginning to experience the negative impact of the COVID-19 situation. So far in Q4, Foodservice shipment declines have accelerated and trends imply a Q4 organic net sales decline that could be in the range of down 50% to 60% versus last year., Retail Business, Demand,\\nFoodservice Business, Sales Decline, COVID-19 Impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to profit, as you would expect, we believe that the significant demand surge in the retail businesses, which was the vast majority of our sales, will positively benefit profit versus our prior guidance. We also expect that the mix of sales and operating leverage of the increased volume will benefit gross margin. Just how much is too speculative to forecast at this time as we are also increasing investment where needed to ensure we support the surge in demand., Profit, Demand Surge,\\nGross Margin, Investment, Forecast, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We are incredibly proud of the investment we are making in the supply chain to meet demand. Not only are we investing as needed to meet customer orders, but we are providing direct financial support and recognition to our people and communities., Investment, Supply Chain,\\nCustomer Orders, Financial Support, Communities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I\\'d now like to turn to our fiscal \\'20 guidance on Slide 33. It was just a bit over a month ago that we shared our updated fiscal \\'20 guidance. And as we told you at CAGNY, we were already seeing improving trends in our categories, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver those updated results., Fiscal \\'20 Guidance, Slide\\n33, Trends, Categories, Confidence, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, However, as a result of what I just discussed about Q4 to-date, we are now unable to forecast Q4 with specificity. But we can say that we expect to exceed the full-year guidance on all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. Although this situation remains highly dynamic, we now see upside to the guidance we provided due to the quarter-to-date surge in consumer demand and the related sales and profit impacts. What we don\\'t know is how long the impacts of this pandemic will last nor do we know exactly how consumers will continue to adapt to the situation in the immediate term or in the longer term as we move into fiscal \\'21., Consumer Demand, Sales\\nImpact, Profit Impact, Cash Flow Metrics, Pandemic Impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As Sean mentioned earlier, our portfolio is well-positioned to meet this increased consumer demand and our team is focused on working with customer\\'s to make sure that orders and shipments remain uninterrupted during this time of need. As long as our strong execution continues and there are no other material disruptions to our ability to provide product safely to our customers, we expect to exceed our fiscal \\'20 guidance across all sales profit and cash flow metrics., Consumer Demand,\\nExecution, Customer Orders, Cash Flow Metrics, Pandemic Impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thanks for listening everyone. That concludes my remarks. Sean and I are happy to take questions. Tom McGough and Darren Serrao are not joining us today as we wanted to minimize the number of speakers since we are managing this Q&A from different locations this morning., Thanks, Remarks,\\nQuestions, Speakers, Locations, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. During the second quarter, we made solid progress across our business. We delivered organic net sales growth in each of our reporting segments, as we continue to implement the Conagra Way to profitable growth. All of our key initiatives remain on track through Q2. We maintained strong momentum in our leading frozen and snacks businesses and grocery benefited from improvement in Hunt\\'s Tomatoes and Chef Boyardee., Thanks, Progress, Business\\nSegments, Key Initiatives, Momentum, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We continued implementing the Conagra Way playbook against the Pinnacle portfolio in the quarter, and our focus on execution is working. Our integration and deleveraging programs remained on target through the second quarter and our synergy capture, which Dave will detail for you today continued to exceed expectations. Overall, we\\'re pleased with our performance through two quarters. And looking ahead, we remain confident in our expectations for the second half and our ability to deliver our fiscal 2020 guidance, which has been updated primarily to account for the impact of recent portfolio changes., Conagra Way, Execution,\\nIntegration, Deleveraging, Synergy Capture, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our agenda this morning is to provide an update on our work on the entire Conagra business, and then provide more detail by segment, starting with Total Conagra. I\\'ll let Dave cover this in more detail. But I want to highlight that our 1.6% organic net sales growth came on the back of 1% volume growth and good price mix performance., Conagra Business, Update,\\nSegment Growth, Volume Growth, Price Mix Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 9 demonstrates how the Conagra playbook is taking hold on the top-line across our entire portfolio. As a reminder, we completed our acquisition of Pinnacle on October 26, 2018, part way through Q2 of fiscal 2019. So for the first time, Pinnacle\\'s results are represented albeit for less than a full quarter in our organic results. We delivered organic net sales growth of 1.6% during the quarter, which brings our year-to-date growth to 0.1%. As we\\'ve talked about previously, we expect fiscal 2020 to be back half weighted, based on the cadence of the actions we\\'re taking, including our innovation launch schedule. We remain confident that we\\'re on track to meet our fiscal \\'20 guidance range of plus 1% to plus 1.5% organic net sales growth., Conagra Playbook,\\nAcquisition, Organic Growth, Fiscal Guidance, Innovation Launch Schedule, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 10 is part of the reason for our confidence in our full year sales outlook. Innovation takes time to build awareness, trial and repeat purchases as you can see on the left, the product we introduced in fiscal year \\'19 are performing even better in the first half of fiscal \\'20, as consumers continue to respond well to our on-trend innovation slate. And building on this success, the chart on the right shows that the new products we launched in the first half of this year are already outperforming fiscal \\'19\\'s new innovation through two quarters., Innovation, Sales Growth,\\nProduct Performance, New Product Launches, Fiscal Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, So while we still have exciting innovation to come this year, the maturing of our recent launches will likely do much of the heavy lifting to drive second half growth. In addition to driving top-line growth, we remain committed to expanding our margins. As you can see on slide 11, the execution of our playbook has allowed us to expand our adjusted operating margin by 21 basis points in the first half of this year, as compared to the same period last year. As I noted at the outset, we\\'re making good progress across all of our integration, synergy and deleveraging initiatives as highlighted on slide 12., Innovation, Growth,\\nMargins, Playbook Execution, Initiatives, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re very pleased with the execution on our integration efforts, which this quarter included exiting Legacy Pinnacle corporate facilities and continuing to convert newly acquired plants to SAP. We also captured an incremental $42 million of cost synergies during the second quarter, bringing total cost synergy realization to $112 million since the closing of our acquisition. As Dave will detail during his remarks, our significant progress has allowed us to increase our synergy target. In addition, we continue to make progress reducing our net debt, and we remain on track with our planned deleveraging., Integration, Cost\\nSynergies, SAP, Net Debt, Deleveraging, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s turn to the segments. Before we go deeper on the individual businesses, I\\'m pleased to report that all four of our segments had positive organic net sales growth in the quarter. Now let\\'s take a look at Frozen. As indicated on slide 15, the Total Conagra Frozen portfolio returned to growth in Q2, even as we continued to execute our value over volume playbook in the Legacy Pinnacle business., Frozen Sales Growth, Total\\nConagra Frozen Portfolio, Value Over Volume Playbook, Segment Performance, Execution, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, On the right side of this page, we see that the Legacy Conagra Frozen portfolio continued to lead our results. The ground work on the Legacy Conagra Frozen brands is now consistently delivering growth on top of growth. As our share performance and our share performance gives us additional confidence in the ongoing success of our Frozen business. Looking at frozen meals on slide 16, you can see that we\\'ve been securing an increased share of shelf in recent quarters. As a result, we\\'re winning in market and benefiting from an increased share of sales as shown in the chart on the right., Legacy Conagra Frozen\\nPortfolio, Share Performance, Growth, Frozen Meals, Market Share, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve been gaining this share by actively partnering with our retail customers to drive profitable growth. These gains have come from introducing new innovations as well as increasing facings and velocities on core items. The result has been stronger growth and market share. Within Frozen, our single-serve meals continued to lead the category through Q2. As shown on slide 17, we\\'ve again delivered sustained growth on top of growth. As you would expect, the large brands in our Legacy Conagra Frozen portfolio such as Healthy Choice, Marie Callender\\'s and Banquet are furthest along in their growth trajectories., Growth, Market Share,\\nInnovation, Retail Customers, Frozen Sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re excited about what\\'s ahead for these brands. We\\'re also excited about the opportunities for the Legacy Pinnacle brands including EVOL, Udi\\'s and Hungry-Man where we\\'re getting started implementing the Conagra Way to profitable growth. One of the Legacy Pinnacle brands that we prioritized over the last 12 months is Birds Eye. And slide 18 is a great example of value over volume in action. As expected, sales and distribution on Birds Eye declined as we removed lower performing SKUs from the market., Excitement, Growth, Legacy\\nPinnacle Brands, Conagra Way, Birds Eye Sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now the brand\\'s distribution trend is starting to bend behind new innovation launches. Our work has also led to share gains versus the branded competition. As shown on slide 19, you can see that Birds Eye gained 20 basis points of share between the first half of fiscal \\'19 and the first half of fiscal \\'20 versus branded competitors. And gained 50 basis points of share over the last quarter, a year ago. This is additional evidence that our early efforts are clearly paying off., Birds Eye Distribution,\\nShare Gains, New Innovation Launches, Branded Competition, Early Efforts Paying Off, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Another Legacy Pinnacle brand we\\'ve been focused on is Gardein. We\\'ve started to expand distribution for Gardein\\'s broad range of offerings. And as a reminder, we\\'ve made significant investments in Gardein\\'s manufacturing and production processes to increase capacity. Our new capacity allows us to better meet the demand for on-trend plant-based protein including in our Foodservice business where Gardein saw strong growth in the second quarter. We continue to see great opportunity for this brand going forward., Gardein Distribution,\\nCapacity Investments, Plant-Based Protein, Foodservice Growth, Opportunity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Throughout the balance of fiscal \\'20, we will build upon our category-leading position in Frozen with strong innovation. The innovation we launched in the first half of fiscal \\'20 is just starting to pick up momentum, and we expect it to continue to perform well in the second half of the year. And we\\'re not going to slow down on Birds Eye. We\\'re focusing on expanding the brand\\'s presence with on-trend value-added products, including the vegetable-based carb replacements, as well as new forms like roasted and shredded vegetables, which we launched in the first half of the year. This innovation is expected to have a larger impact in the second half as we continue to build distribution and invest behind consumer trial and repeat., Innovation, Frozen\\nCategory, Birds Eye, Distribution, Consumer Trial, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Launching later this year will be another on transform spiralized vegetables. Admittedly, Birds Eye was late to the party here, but we\\'re excited about what a proven product like spiralized can do beginning in the second half of the year. Now I would like to turn to our Grocery & Snacks segment and start with our leading snacks portfolio., Birds Eye, Spiralized\\nVegetables, Grocery & Snacks, Leading Portfolio, Second Half of Year, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Snacks had another terrific quarter, maintaining its momentum. Slide 23 shows the continued success of this portfolio. Total Legacy Conagra Snacks were up 5.2% during the quarter, delivering 10.4% growth on a two-year basis. Our results were led by Meat Snacks and Sweet Treats businesses, which delivered growth of 7.8% and 7.3% respectively. We launched a number of on-trend innovative snacking products within our $2 billion plus portfolio at max in October. We\\'ve had great customer reactions to these exceptional new innovations and we expect them to support our continued momentum in the second half. You\\'ll have a chance to try many of these great new products at CAGNY in February., Momentum, Snacks\\nPortfolio, Growth, Innovation, Second Half, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also making great progress on our work to reframe Duncan Hines as a sweet treat to unlock significant growing demand spaces. Our strategy includes refreshed packaging, fun and novel flavors and new shelf-stable and frozen snacking platforms. And as you can see on slide 25, our earliest work focused on the core shelf-stable baking mixes has begun to result in share gains, as the holiday baking season kicked off., Duncan Hines, Share Gains,\\nSweet Treats, Refreshed Packaging, Novel Flavors, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re building on this momentum by introducing more innovation in the second half, including on-trend keto-friendly cakes and co-branded Oreo Cake Cups. Turning to our Grocery portfolio, we\\'re pleased with the improved trends on our key Chef Boyardee and Hunt\\'s Tomato businesses, both have a leadership role in their respective categories, and are of critical importance to consumers. Slide 26 shows the traction these businesses are beginning to see from continued investment and smart promotional support. After responding to marketplace dynamics, both Hunt\\'s and Chef Boyardee made sequential improvements in the quarter., Momentum, Innovation,\\nGrocery Portfolio, Trends, Leadership Role, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Wish-Bone is also improving. As we\\'ve noted, Wish-Bone was challenged by several issues, service, quality and our label change execution issue. As we lap the closing of the Pinnacle transaction, and have almost a year of implementing the Conagra Way playbook against the brand, we stabilized Wish-Bone and year-over-year sales growth has moved into positive territory. Slide 28 shows another part of our playbook in action. We\\'re excited to participate in the salad dressings category and believe it\\'s right for disruptive innovation., Wish-Bone, Conagra Way,\\nSalad Dressings, Positive Territory, Disruptive Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Healthy Choice Power Dressing is a new line of vegetable-based dressings. This exciting new product extension builds on the success of our Power Bowls frozen meals by bringing modern attributes that are relevant to consumers to a large category. We expect these terrific new products to bring the kind of new news that shoppers will welcome., Healthy Choice, Power\\nDressing, Vegetable-Based Dressings, New Product Extension, Modern Attributes, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, I\\'ll conclude with a few quick remarks about our International and Foodservice segments. In international, the second quarter brought continued strong performance in Canada as well as distribution gains in Mexico. In Foodservice, recall that in Q1, we made the strategic decision to opt out of a particularly low margin contract consistent with our value over volume strategy. This past quarter, we\\'ve seen strong sales as we predicted in our Snacks business as well as in the Gardein and Udi\\'s brands. In addition, operating margins improved year-over-year., International,\\nFoodservice, Strong Performance, Value Over Volume, Operating Margins, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Overall, we see good progress through the first half of the year. We\\'ve had success with our innovation slate and expect that to continue in the second half. We remain on track with our plan, and confident in our ability to accelerate growth in the second half and deliver our fiscal 2020 guidance., Good Progress, Innovation\\nSlate, Second Half, Fiscal 2020 Guidance, Confidence, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Today, I\\'ll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal \\'20 performance as well as the updates to our guidance. We\\'ll then move to Q&A. As Sean noted, October 26, marked the first anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As a result, about one month of Legacy Pinnacle performance is included in our organic results for the second quarter, which ended on November 24, 2019. I\\'ll start by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter, which you can find on slide 32., Second Quarter\\nPerformance, Fiscal \\'20 Guidance, Pinnacle Acquisition, Organic Results, Q&A, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Reported net sales for the second quarter were up 18.3% versus the same period a year ago, primarily reflecting the continued impact of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition. Organic net sales increased 1.6% driven by 1% volume growth and 0.6% price mix favorability. As Sean mentioned, every segment delivered organic net sales growth this quarter. For the second quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 14.1% to $804 million, primarily driven by the net impact of the addition of Pinnacle\\'s gross profit as well as cost synergies., Pinnacle Foods\\nAcquisition, Organic Net Sales Growth, Adjusted Gross Profit, Segment Performance, Cost Synergies, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Price mix and supply chain productivity also benefited the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by input cost inflation, increased brand-building investments with retailers and a reduction in profit from the divestitures of the Wesson oil, Gelit, and DSD snacks businesses over the last year. Adjusted SG&A came in at 9.2% of net sales for Q2 as we continue to recognize SG&A synergies from the Pinnacle acquisition. Adjusted net income increased 8.3%, as the improvement in operating profit and cost synergies more than offset the impact of higher interest expense associated with the Pinnacle transaction and the reduction of profit from recent divestitures., Price Mix, Supply Chain\\nProductivity, Input Cost Inflation, Brand-Building Investments, Divestitures, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, It\\'s also worth noting that adjusted EBITDA, which includes equity method investment earnings and pension and post-retirement non-service income increased 17.2% to $610 million in the quarter. As I\\'ll describe in more detail in a moment, our adjusted diluted EPS decreased 6% to $0.63 for the quarter. Slide 33 outlines the drivers of second quarter net sales growth of 18.3% versus the same period a year ago. We delivered year-over-year volume growth for the quarter. And as you can see, we continue to drive an increase in price mix, despite the additional retailer investments to support brand building that we highlighted last quarter., Adjusted EBITDA, Diluted\\nEPS, Volume Growth, Price Mix, Brand Building Investments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Total retailer investments reduced the net sales growth rate by 150 basis points, which was a bit favorable to our expectations. Our slotting related expense, which is closely tied to new innovation launches increased as planned. But we also deliver -- delivered better-than-expected efficiencies in other trade programs. The increase in net sales associated with acquisitions includes 61 days of Pinnacle before it entered the organic base, which added approximately 20% of net sales, and was offset by a 2.9% net sales decrease from the divestitures of the Wesson oil, Gelit and DSD snacks businesses., Total Retailer\\nInvestments, Slotting Related Expense, Trade Programs, Acquisitions, Divestitures, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Moving to slide 34, you can see our sales summary by segment. As Sean discussed, we made very good progress across the portfolio and delivered organic net sales growth in all four segments during the second quarter. Grocery & Snacks\\' net sales increased 14.2% in Q2, with the acquisition of Pinnacle adding 16.9% and the divestiture of the Wesson oil and DSD snacks businesses subtracting 3.6%. Organic net sales for this segment increased 0.9%, reflecting continued strong end market performance, and innovation successes across many of our snacking brands., Grocery & Snacks, Organic\\nNet Sales Growth, Segment Performance, Divestitures, Acquisitions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Refrigerated & Frozen, quarterly net sales and organic net sales for the segment increased 20 -- 28.8% and 2.4% respectively. Once again, this segment benefited from a robust slate of innovation across multiple brands including Birds Eye, Healthy Choice, Marie Callender\\'s, and P.F. Chang\\'s. Our International segment continued to benefit from growth in the Snacks and Frozen businesses in the second quarter. International net sales increased 7.3% primarily due to the acquisition of Pinnacle., Refrigerated & Frozen,\\nInnovation, Segment Performance, Acquisitions, International, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Organic net sales increased 1.8% driven by an increase in volume. Net sales for the Foodservice segment increased 6.8% in Q2, with an organic net sales increase of 0.8%. The organic net sales increase was mostly driven by a 3.6% improvement in price mix, partially offset by volume declines of 2.8% as a result of the segment\\'s continued execution of value over volume, which drove additional operating margin improvement., Organic Net Sales Growth,\\nVolume Declines, Price Mix, Foodservice Segment, Operating Margin Improvement, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 35 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the quarter versus the prior year. Inflation in Q2 was roughly in line with our expectations. At the same time, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and synergies more than offset inflation in the quarter. We\\'re just beginning to lap the anniversary of the steel inflation headwind we began to experience during the same period last year. But we do estimate increased inflation related to proteins moving forward. We continue to estimate full year fiscal \\'20 inflation of approximately 2.8%., Inflation, Gross Margin\\nExpansion, Adjusted Operating Margin Bridge, Steel Inflation Headwind, Protein Inflation Estimate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, With respect to A&P, we continue to focus on driving the right level of spend on the highest ROI opportunities. In this quarter, our working A&P, that is A&P investments that reached the consumer directly increased year-over-year. The overall decrease in A&P shown on slide 35 was driven by lower spending on non-working expenses, such as research costs, along with A&P synergies associated with the Pinnacle deal., A&P Spend, ROI\\nOpportunities, Working A&P, Non-Working Expenses, A&P Synergies, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 36 outlines our significant progress to-date on overall Pinnacle synergy capture. We realized $42 million of cost synergies this quarter, bringing total cost synergy realization $112 million from the close of the acquisition through the second quarter. Just to clarify, this $42 million is the incremental synergy benefit versus a year ago, as we captured $1 million of synergies in Q2 last year., Pinnacle Synergy Capture,\\nCost Synergies Realized, Total Cost Synergy Realization, Incremental Synergy Benefit, Year-Over-Year\\nComparison, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our synergy target when we first announced the Pinnacle acquisition was $215 million. As we dug in with the benefit of more information after the acquisition closing, we found additional synergy opportunities. Accordingly, at our Investor Day in April, we announced an increase to our total Pinnacle related cost synergy target to approximately $285 million through fiscal \\'22. From a cadence standpoint, we announced that 55% of that total or approximately $160 million was expected to come by the end of fiscal \\'20., Synergy, Pinnacle,\\nCost, Fiscal Year, Cadence, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I\\'m pleased to say that we continue to improve on our synergy delivery and are tracking above target. Today, we are increasing our synergy capture expectation for fiscal \\'20 from approximately $160 million to approximately $180 million. And we are updating our total synergy target from approximately $285 million to approximately $305 million through fiscal \\'22. The $20 million of additional synergy is primarily driven by favorable SG&A, A&P and trade efficiency. We made the strategic decision to reinvest the additional $20 million back into the business this fiscal year., Synergy, Fiscal\\nYear, Capture, Target, Reinvestment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We have a long list of sales driving investment opportunities available to us. Improved product quality and packaging, further retailer and distribution investments to support the long-term growth of our brands, and consumer facing advertising .We\\'re proud of the team\\'s progress in capturing these incremental synergies and the creation of additional fuel for growth., Investment,\\nGrowth, Synergy, Quality, Packaging, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 37 outlines Conagra\\'s adjusted operating profit and operating margin summary for the second quarter. Our adjusted operating profit increased 15.7% in Q2, and our adjusted operating margin came in at 17.1%. We\\'re pleased with the performance across segments, with three of the four seeing expanded margins., Adjusted Operating\\nProfit, Adjusted Operating Margin, Segments, Performance, Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to slide 38, we\\'ve outlined the drivers of our Q2 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, our adjusted EPS of $0.63 decreased by $0.04 this quarter compared to the same period last year. The increase in adjusted operating profit and the benefit from Ardent Mills, were more than offset by increases in interest expense and shares outstanding. Given the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition during the quarter, we expect share count interest expense to have less of an impact on adjusted EPS comparisons going forward., Adjusted Diluted\\nEPS, Q2, Operating Profit, Ardent Mills, Share Count, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 39 summarizes net debt and cash flow information. I\\'m pleased with the work being done across the organization to achieve our deleveraging and free cash flow targets. We have continued to make strong sequential improvements in reducing debt and improving the overall financial health of the business. We expect our deleveraging to accelerate in the second half of fiscal \\'20 due to the seasonality of our cash flows. Since the close of the acquisition and through the end of the second quarter, we\\'ve reduced total gross debt by $1.1 billion and net debt by over $800 million., Deleveraging, Cash\\nFlow, Financial Health, Debt Reduction, Seasonality, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We remain committed to a solid investment grade credit rating and achieving our fiscal \\'21 target of a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.6 times to 3.5 times. At the end of the second quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately 8.7 years, and our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7%. At the end of the second quarter, fixed rate debt was approximately 87% of our total debt. We are reaffirming our fiscal \\'20 guidance given our progress year-to-date and expectations for a solid performance for the balance of the year., Investment Grade\\nCredit Rating, Fiscal \\'21 Target, Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Average Debt Maturity, Weighted\\nAverage Coupon, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As announced in our release, we are updating a few components of our fiscal \\'20 guidance, primarily as a result of recent transactions. Overall, we expect second half results to show stronger organic net sales growth than in the first half, due to the timing of the impacts of new innovation in the Frozen and Snacks business, improved trends in key grocery brands, as well as the impact of easier comparisons. With respect to operating margins, we expect year-over-year growth during the second half of fiscal \\'20 as we reaffirm our full-year operating margin guidance range., Fiscal \\'20\\nGuidance, Second Half Results, Organic Net Sales Growth, Operating Margins, Full-Year Guidance\\nRange, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Also in the second half, we will have anniversaried the higher levels of interest expense and share count, allowing for easier EPS comparisons as we move through the remainder of the fiscal year. We are updating our reported net sales growth, adjusted diluted EPS range and free cash flow estimate to primarily reflect the divestiture of our DSD snacks business and our planned exit of the manufacture and sale of private label peanut butter., Interest Expense,\\nShare Count, Net Sales Growth, Adjusted Diluted EPS Range, Free Cash Flow Estimate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In addition, as outlined in our earnings release, after the end of the quarter, Conagra entered into a definitive agreement to divest the Lender\\'s bagels business. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter fiscal \\'20, and the expected annualized impact of the divestiture is a reduction of approximately $50 million of net sales and $0.01 of adjusted EPS., Divestment,\\nLender\\'s Bagels Business, Net Sales, Adjusted EPS, Third Quarter Fiscal \\'20, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finally, we look forward to presenting at CAGNY in February, where we will provide another update on our progress in executing that Conagra Way playbook. For those of you attending, make sure to bring your appetite. We\\'ll be sharing many of our most exciting innovations at the events kick-off reception., Conagra Way,\\nInnovations, CAGNY, February, Kick-Off Reception, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 2, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you for listening. That concludes my remarks. I\\'ll now pass it back to the operator, as Sean, Tom McGough, Darren Serrao and I are happy to take your questions., Thank You,\\nRemarks, Questions, Operator, Pass, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Fiscal 2020 is on track following a very solid Q1. We continue to implement the Conagra Way to profitable growth by executing against the principles and plans we shared at Investor Day. We\\'re applying our value over volume playbook to the Legacy Pinnacle portfolio and we\\'ve made important progress strengthening the foundation of the business and repositioning Pinnacle\\'s leadership brands for profitable growth. We\\'re also pleased to report that our ongoing integration and synergy capture related to the Pinnacle business and our deleveraging progress remain squarely on track., Fiscal 2020, First\\nQuarter, Conagra Way, Value Over Volume Playbook, Integration and Synergy Capture, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In Legacy Conagra, we continued to deliver solid execution and maintained our momentum in the first quarter, particularly in our leading frozen and snacks businesses. Looking ahead, we remain confident that our second half results will reflect stronger growth than the first half. We\\'ll lap the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition and the easier comps due to the start of our value over volume execution across its portfolio. We\\'ll also begin to benefit from the exciting new innovations that are being introduced to the market. Therefore, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2020 guidance for all previously communicated metrics. Our agenda this morning is to provide an update on our work on the Legacy Pinnacle business, discuss our continued progress on Legacy Conagra and share some additional details on our expectations for the remainder of the year., Legacy Conagra,\\nFirst Quarter, Pinnacle Business, Second Half, Fiscal 2020 Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to the Legacy Pinnacle portfolio. Before diving into the details here, I\\'d like to take a step back and review the central tenets of our value over volume playbook, which is essentially our approach to optimizing the base business and establishing a stronger foundation on which to build. As you\\'ve heard me say before, value over volume is a disciplined approach to growth that acknowledges not all volume is created equal and consumer demands are always evolving., Value Over Volume\\nPlaybook, Legacy Pinnacle Portfolio, Central Tenets, Growth, Consumer Demands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The approach dictates that we consistently apply rigor to portfolio management, value over volume involves eliminating weaker SKUs in advance of the launch of higher performing new products and the associated brand building investments. It also involves renovating the core and getting the fundamentals right. These fundamentals include pricing, promotion, assortment, distribution, product quality and packaging., Portfolio\\nManagement, Value Over Volume, Brand Building, Fundamentals, Pricing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We previously shared that our application of value over volume to the Legacy Pinnacle portfolio would be a key priority. And as you can see on Slide 7, we\\'re making real progress. In fact, we\\'re seeing very similar patterns to what we saw in Legacy Conagra a few years ago. We\\'ve trimmed low-quality SKUs from the marketplace. We\\'ve seen TPDs decline near term, but importantly, we\\'ve also seen base velocities improve sharply. We demonstrated on brands like Banquet and Healthy Choice in Legacy Conagra this creates a much stronger foundation on which to infuse brand-building investments., Value Over Volume,\\nPortfolio Management, Brand Building, Base Velocities, TPDs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Wish-Bone is one of the key Legacy Pinnacle brands where we\\'re furthest along in strengthening the foundation. As we\\'ve discussed previously, Wish-Bone was challenged by several issues; service, quality and the label change execution. We identified the issues and took action fixing the service challenges, improving labels for better and variety communication and also upgrading the product quality., Wish-Bone, Legacy\\nPinnacle Brands, Foundation Strengthening, Service Challenges, Product Quality Upgrade, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 8, we\\'ve stabilized the business. In fact, we grew it in Q1. We also remain highly focused on executing our playbook on the Birds Eye and Duncan Hines brands. Low performing SKUs have come out of the market and fundamentals are improving. Keep in mind that we\\'re in the very early stages of recognizing the benefits from our new innovations in these categories. The shelf reset windows at large customers are different than they are for Wish-Bone. So the timing of their recoveries is different. We do anticipate improvement in the second half of fiscal 2020 for both of these brands as they begin to benefit from the addition of our new innovation slate. We\\'re confident that the Birds Eye and Duncan Hines brands will continue to stabilize and are on track for profitable growth., Stabilization,\\nGrowth, New Innovations, Fundamentals Improvement, Second Half Fiscal 2020, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also remain on track across all our integration, synergy and deleveraging initiatives as highlighted on Slide 10. Across the board, we\\'re very pleased with the execution of our integration activities. Our employee related transitions are now substantially complete and since the close of the transaction through the end of Q1, we\\'ve realized $71 million of cost synergies., Integration,\\nSynergy, Deleveraging, Cost Synergies, Execution, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, From a balance sheet perspective, we\\'re on schedule with our deleveraging plan having reduced total gross debt by $148 million in the first quarter and by more than $1 billion from the transaction close through the end of Q1. As we consistently said, we remain firmly committed to maintaining a solid investment grade credit rating. Overall, we had a solid first quarter on Legacy Pinnacle, we\\'ve made good progress in strengthening the foundation across the portfolio and look forward to continued improvement in the back half of the year as we begin to benefit from the new innovations., Balance Sheet,\\nDeleveraging Plan, Investment Grade Credit Rating, New Innovations, First Quarter Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to Legacy Conagra. The business started the year well and we\\'re pleased with the trends we\\'re seeing. The Legacy Conagra business delivered solid performance during the quarter. Together, the two large domestic retail businesses outperformed their planned organic net sales growth. Yet again, we saw terrific momentum in our Legacy Conagra frozen and snacks businesses. As expected, our grocery sales performance in Q1 was impacted by some holdover from the Hunt\\'s and Chef Boyardee dynamics that we detailed last quarter., Legacy Conagra,\\nBusiness Performance, Trends, Grocery Sales, Hunt\\'s and Chef Boyardee Dynamics, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we\\'ll share with you today, we have action plans in place and trends are already improving. But we also experienced some unplanned softness in our International and Foodservice segments during the quarter and this negatively impacted our top line performance. This softness relates to some one-time issues and both segments are expected to recover in the second half. Importantly, despite these top line headwinds, our International and Foodservice segments over-delivered their profit plans for the quarter., Action Plans,\\nTrends Improving, Softness in Segments, Profit Plan Over-Delivery, Second Half Recovery, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s get into each of these items in more detail. Turning to slide 13, you can see that total retail sales for the Legacy Conagra business were up 0.9% from the same period a year ago, demonstrating 2.7% growth over the two-year period. While I\\'ll walk you through the year-on-year drivers of the fiscal year in a moment, you can see in this chart that the two-year growth rate has been fairly stable for the past four quarters and we\\'re entering a period of easier comparisons on a one-year basis., Total Retail\\nSales, Two-Year Growth Rate, Year-on-Year Drivers, Easier Comparisons, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, On slide 14, you can see that we continued our momentum in the Legacy Conagra frozen portfolio throughout the first quarter with retail sales growing 2.5%. In addition, our Legacy Conagra frozen meals business continued to outperform our peers in Q1. In fact, it has become the industry leader in the frozen category. Our Legacy Conagra meals business -- frozen meals business now has been in Number 1 position in share of total retail sales and gained share of category dollars in Q1., Retail Sales\\nGrowth, Frozen Portfolio, Industry Leader, Share of Total Retail Sales, Share of Category Dollars, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 16 demonstrates that we\\'re also gaining share of shelf. As we discussed, in some instances, our actions to remove low-performing products drives lower TPDs as we create more holding power for our higher velocity items. In other cases, we\\'ve seen TPDs expand. In either event, our goal is to grow share of shelf and that\\'s exactly what we\\'re doing. As we know, our retail customers run the ultimate meritocracy. They will give more space to the products that move off the shelf the fastest. This data demonstrates that we\\'re earning more shelf space by having products that consumers demand., Gaining Share of\\nShelf, Low-Performing Products, TPDs Expanding, Retail Customers, Meritocracy, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Importantly, shelf space is a leading indicator that bodes well for our opportunity to grow sales. Frozen wasn\\'t the only leader in our Legacy Conagra portfolio in Q1. Snacks also maintained momentum through the first quarter and delivered strong results across a variety of brands and categories. Total retail sales in snacks were up an impressive 7.2% versus a year ago. Meat snacks and seeds emerged as particularly strong leaders with an increase in retail sales of 9.4% and 8.5%, respectively. Overall retail dollar sales in snacks demonstrated sustained performance improvement throughout the first quarter, having grown 9.8% on a two-year basis., Shelf Space,\\nFrozen Portfolio, Snacks Performance, Leading Indicator, Retail Dollar Sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Similar to frozen, our Legacy Conagra snacks business is also outperforming its peers and gaining share as demonstrated on slide 18. Turning to the Legacy Conagra grocery portfolio for a moment, if you recall, last quarter we faced headwinds in our grocery portfolio related to pricing and promotional challenges. As the cost of steel cans increased, we implemented inflation justified pricing on Hunt\\'s canned tomatoes and Chef Boyardee to partially offset the increased cost. However, our private label competition in canned tomatoes kept prices flat, and in some instances, actually decreased prices. And on Chef Boyardee, we lost some high-quality merchandizing. The effect of these dynamics was a higher-than-expected volume decline in Q4. We planned for this decline to continue through the first quarter as a carryover from Q4, and it did. We\\'ve already begun implementing action plans for each of these brands to reverse this trend., Legacy Conagra\\nSnacks Business, Gaining Share, Legacy Conagra Grocery Portfolio, Pricing and Promotional\\nChallenges, Action Plans, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, But before I get into the year-to-go, I\\'ll cover Foodservice and International. As I mentioned earlier, we faced some unplanned softness in the top-line performance in our International and Foodservice segments during the quarter., International\\nSoftness, Foodservice Segment, Unplanned Softness, Top-Line Performance, Year-to-Go, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The International segment was impacted by external events in Puerto Rico and India that shifted the timing of sales previously expected in Q1 to the second half. While this shift in timing impacts our quarter-to-quarter results, we expect that it will have no net impact on the top line for the fiscal year. Partially offsetting this timing shift, our International segment benefited from growth in snacks and frozen. The improved mix, as well as cost savings resulted in higher-than-planned operating profit and margins in the quarter., International\\nSegment, External Events, Timing of Sales, Top-Line Impact, Operating Profit Margins, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In our Foodservice segment, we made the strategic decision this quarter to opt out of a particularly low-margin contract consistent with our value-over-volume strategy. While this decision negatively impacted our top line in the near term, it was the right thing to do for the health of the business and benefited our Q1 margins in the segment. Furthermore, we expect stronger top-line performance in Foodservice for the balance of the year with new items coming to market. We also expect better-than-anticipated performance from Gardein within the Foodservice segment, which will start to be included in our organic number during the second quarter., Strategic\\nDecision, Value-Over-Volume Strategy, Top-Line Performance, Foodservice Segment, New Items Coming to\\nMarket, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Looking ahead, we\\'re excited about what\\'s to come in the back half of the year. First, we are providing more promotional support on Hunt\\'s and Chef Boyardee to better compete in markets. Second, we\\'ve got a strong investment plan for Q2 for the new innovation that\\'s about to hit the market. In fact, the second quarter will mark the peak of our investment cycle as we incur launch expenses to tee-up our slate of new products. And third, we expect terrific second half growth., New Innovation,\\nPromotional Support, Second Half Growth, Launch Expenses, Peak of Investment Cycle, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll see innovation build across many of our segments in the second half of the year. We expect our in-store presence to be much stronger and drive growth. In some categories, this will be on the back of increased TPDs and in others, it will come on the back of increased facings on high-velocity items. We will also benefit from easier comparisons in the back half of the year, as we lap prior-year value-over-volume activity and increased competition. In addition, we will lap the anniversary of our Pinnacle acquisition, discrete supply chain disruptions and the higher interest expense and share count that started in Q2 of last year., Innovation, In-\\nStore Presence, TPDs, Facings, Easier Comparisons, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s go into each of these items in a bit more detail. Starting in the second quarter, we began launching new smart promotional support for Hunt\\'s and Chef Boyardee to improve volume trends. Remember, Hunt\\'s and Chef Boyardee continue to maintain the Number 1 position in their categories among branded competitors. Both brands are of critical importance to consumers., New Smart\\nPromotional Support, Hunt\\'s and Chef Boyardee, Number 1 Position, Critical Importance to Consumers, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re already seeing early traction on both brands as demonstrated on slide 23. The first two weeks of our second quarter have shown the benefit of these strategic promotions. It\\'s certainly early days and we have some tougher comps in the weeks ahead, given the year-ago hurricane activity, but we\\'re confident that we have the right marketplace strategies now in place to deliver sequential improvement throughout the second half of the year., Early Traction,\\nStrategic Promotions, Second Quarter, Sequential Improvement, Tougher Comps, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also excited to introduce exciting new products to our $2 billion snacks portfolio throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Our latest innovation slate, a portion of which is shown here, will premiere at NACS in October. We\\'re delivering products with bold flavors, new forms and optimized price pack architecture. If any of you are at NACS, please stop by our booth to see this great work for yourself., New Products,\\nSnacks Portfolio, Innovation Slate, Bold Flavors, Price Pack Architecture, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re proud of our snacks portfolio. It\\'s one of the fastest growing. We\\'re confident that our continued innovation in this space will further differentiate and elevate our already iconic brands. We\\'re also excited about our new Conagra Brands Center for Food Design, which we expect to open in the first calendar quarter of 2020 next door to our headquarters in Chicago. This is an expansion of our state-of-the-art R&D and culinary capabilities and will be exclusively focused on snacking-related innovation. This facility will combine culinary food and packaging design expertise in one space, enabling the rapid development of even more contemporary snacking products., Fastest Growing\\nSnacks Portfolio, Continued Innovation, New Conagra Brands Center, State-of-the-Art R&D, Exclusive\\nFocus, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also introducing reinvigorated innovation to our Sweet Treats portfolio in the back half of the year across both Legacy Pinnacle and Legacy Conagra Brands. Duncan Hines is being reframed as a sweet treat to unlock significant growing demand spaces with refreshed packaging, fun and novel flavors, and new snacking platforms. Legacy Conagra\\'s snacking brands will also receive an injection of innovation to capture consumer excitement with trending kid-friendly themes., Reinvigorated\\nInnovation, Sweet Treats Portfolio, Legacy Pinnacle, Legacy Conagra Brands, Consumer Excitement, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We plan to build upon our category-leading position in frozen, by introducing our strongest innovation slate to-date throughout the balance of fiscal 2020. We\\'ve been strategically tailoring our products to fit the needs of today\\'s busy consumers by providing them with premium nutritious ingredients and increasing sustainability all at affordable price points. Birds Eye is expected to benefit meaningfully from these efforts. We expect Birds Eye performance to accelerate in the second half, as we see the impact of our recently launched innovation slate, as well as upcoming new product introductions, including spiralized zucchini. As one of the largest brand in frozen vegetables, we\\'re confident that Birds Eye is well positioned to capitalize on contemporary forms and trending flavors., Category-Leading\\nPosition, Strategic Innovation, Premium Ingredients, Sustainability, Birds Eye Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Another brand in our portfolio with significant growth opportunity is Gardein, which we spoke about at length last quarter. We\\'re working hard to continue to build out the Gardein brand to capitalize on the explosive growth in the plant-based meat alternative space. The Gardein Foodservice business grew an impressive 25% in the first quarter and continues to accelerate penetration across multiple foodservice channels. As we shared with you last quarter, the brand is the second largest in the plant-based meat alternative space and has already quadrupled in size over the past four years., Gardein Growth,\\nPlant-Based Meat Alternative, Foodservice Penetration, Brand Acceleration, Size Quadrupled, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In retail, we expect Gardein to gain prominence in both frozen and refrigerated, as we introduce more high-quality innovation. An on-trend brand with modern attributes, Gardein is uniquely positioned to generate superior velocities by leveraging Conagra\\'s culinary capabilities, differentiated packaging techniques and our diverse portfolio of power brands, and we are well positioned to support Gardein\\'s continued growth with new capacity coming online during Q2., Gardein Growth,\\nRetail Prominence, High-Quality Innovation, On-Trend Brand, Differentiated Packaging, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Overall, we\\'re pleased with the progress Conagra has made in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We\\'re on track with our plan and confident in our ability to accelerate growth in the second half of the year and deliver our fiscal 2020 guidance., Progress, Plan,\\nGrowth Acceleration, Fiscal 2020 Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Sean and good morning everyone. This morning, I\\'ll walk through our first quarter fiscal \\'20 performance before we open it up for questions. As a reminder, starting this quarter, Conagra no longer reports Pinnacle as a stand-alone reporting segment. Pinnacle\\'s business components have been allocated to the four Legacy Conagra reporting segments to reflect how we are now managing the business. You can find historical segment financial information that reflects this recast in an 8-K furnished with the SEC on September 23rd., First Quarter\\nPerformance, Fiscal Year \\'20, Pinnacle Segment, Legacy Conagra Segments, Historical Segment\\nFinancial Information, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 31 outlines our performance for the quarter. I\\'ll walk through more detail in a moment, but I\\'ll start here by noting a few highlights. Compared to the same period a year ago, net sales for the first quarter were up 30.3%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. Organic net sales were down 1.7%. The decrease in organic net sales was primarily driven by the unplanned softness in International and Foodservice and the planned declines in our Grocery & Snacks segment that Sean discussed., Net Sales Growth,\\nAcquisition of Pinnacle Foods, Organic Net Sales Decline, International and Foodservice Softness,\\nGrocery & Snacks Segment Decline, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted operating profit for the first quarter was up 40% and adjusted operating margin increased 108 basis points to 15.7%, which was ahead of our internal expectations. I\\'ll walk you through the adjusted EPS bridge in a moment. However, I want to highlight that while our adjusted EPS decreased 8.5% to $0.43 for the quarter, adjusted net income increased 12.5%. Our increase in operating profit more than offset the impact of the increased interest expense associated with the Pinnacle transaction., Adjusted Operating\\nProfit Growth, Adjusted Operating Margin Increase, Adjusted EPS Decrease, Interest Expense\\nAssociated with Pinnacle Transaction, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 32 outlines the drivers of our first quarter net sales versus the same period a year ago. We continued to drive an increase in price mix even after taking into account our increases and retailer investments to support brand building. It should also be noted that the 32.1% increase from acquisitions and divestitures includes 3.7 percentage points of decrease from the sales of the Wesson oil, Gelit and Canadian Del Monte businesses and the Trenton production facility., Drivers of Net\\nSales Growth, Price Mix Increase, Acquisitions and Divestitures, Wesson Oil, Gelit, Canadian Del\\nMonte Businesses, Trenton Production Facility, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 33 provides a summary of net sales by segment for the first quarter. Again, the Legacy Pinnacle business has been allocated to the four other reporting segments, so we are not showing a Pinnacle segment anymore. I will discuss Pinnacle Q1 net sales in more detail shortly., Net Sales by\\nSegment, Legacy Pinnacle Business Allocation, Pinnacle Net Sales Detail, Segment Discussion, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Grocery & Snacks net sales increased 26.9% in Q1, as the acquisition of Pinnacle added 34.7% and the divestiture of Wesson oil subtracted 4.1% from the net sales growth rate. Organic net sales for Grocery & Snacks decreased 3.7% as the planned declines in Hunt\\'s tomatoes and Chef Boyardee, were partially offset by continued strong end-market performance and innovation success in our Snacks business., Grocery & Snacks\\nNet Sales Growth, Pinnacle Acquisition, Wesson Oil Divestiture, Organic Net Sales Decline, Hunt\\'s\\nTomatoes and Chef Boyardee Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The Refrigerated & Frozen segment benefited, once again, from our robust slate of innovation across multiple Legacy Conagra brands including Banquet, Healthy Choice, P.F. Chang\\'s, Reddi-wip, and Sandwich Bros. During the quarter, Refrigerated & Frozen net sales and organic net sales increased 51% and 1.5%, respectively, with organic growth in both volume and price mix., Refrigerated &\\nFrozen Segment Growth, Innovation Across Legacy Conagra Brands, Banquet, Healthy Choice, P.F.\\nChang\\'s, Reddi-wip, Sandwich Bros, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our International segment increased net sales 5.5% in Q1, due primarily to the acquisition of Pinnacle. International organic net sales continued to benefit from growth in the snacks and frozen businesses in certain regions. However, the segment\\'s organic net sales were down versus plan in prior year, due to discrete items in our businesses in Puerto Rico and India. As Sean mentioned, these items shifted the timing of sales previously expected in Q1 to the second half. This timing shift contributed to a decrease of 3% in organic net sales during the quarter., International\\nSegment Growth, Pinnacle Acquisition, International Organic Net Sales Growth, Discrete Items\\nAffecting Segment Performance, Timing Shift of Sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In our Foodservice segment, we made the strategic decision in Q1 to opt out of a lower margin contract consistent with our value-over-volume strategy. As a result of this decision, Foodservice organic net sales declined 3.2% for the quarter. Reported net sales increased 6.3% during the quarter, with the acquisition of Pinnacle adding 15.3% and the sales of Wesson and Trenton subtracting 5.8% from the net sales growth rate. We expect a strong -- stronger balance of year performance from the Foodservice segment with new items coming to market and improved performance from Gardein., Foodservice, Strategy, Sales, Acquisition, Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 34 outlines Pinnacle\\'s fiscal \\'20 net sales for Q1 versus fiscal year \\'19 pro forma net sales for the same period. The 9.2% sales decline was largely in line with our expectations, as we increased brand building investments with retailers, eliminated some low-quality promotions, and solved some inventory reductions with retailers in advance of implementing new shelf sets. While these dynamics led to a wider-than-typical difference between shipments and consumption in the quarter, we don\\'t expect this dynamic to continue for the year-to-go period., Brand\\nBuilding, Investments, Promotions, Sales, Shipments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 35 outlines the puts and takes of our Q1 adjusted operating margin versus the prior year. It\\'s worth noting that the impact of the Legacy Pinnacle gross profit was a decrease to operating margin of 46 basis points during the quarter versus the prior year. Our Legacy Conagra realized productivity initiatives are progressing as planned and helping to offset inflation, which approximated 2.8% in Q1. We are also seeing the margin benefit of Pinnacle synergies in Q1, particularly in SG&A., Adjusted\\nOperating Margin, Legacy Pinnacle, Productivity Initiatives, Inflation, Synergies, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 36 outlines the significant progress on Pinnacle synergy capture, which remains on track in all areas; SG&A, cost of goods sold and trade spending. We realized approximately $40 million of cost savings in the quarter, which brings total cost synergy capture to approximately $71 million since the closing of the acquisition through the first quarter. We continue to expect synergies to increase throughout fiscal \\'20. And as previously announced, expect to achieve the majority of our $285 million in cost synergies related to the transaction by the end of fiscal \\'20., Synergy\\nCapture, Cost Savings, SG&A, Trade Spending, Fiscal Year 20, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Moving to slide 37, Conagra\\'s total adjusted operating profit increased 40% in Q1. Our adjusted operating margin came in at 15.7%. Each segment\\'s adjusted operating profit benefited from the addition of Pinnacle\\'s profit. The International segment was the only segment to see a decline in adjusted operating profit in the quarter, and that was driven by the impacts of divestitures, unfavorable FX and the volume impact from the discrete items in the quarter., Adjusted\\nOperating Profit, Adjusted Operating Margin, Pinnacle\\'s Profit, International Segment, Divestitures, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The Grocery & Snacks segment margin decreased year-over-year. Approximately half of the margin decline was the result of the Legacy Pinnacle Grocery & Snacks business being dilutive to overall segment gross margin, with the rest of the decline coming from inflation and brand investment with retailers, exceeding pricing and realized productivity., Grocery &\\nSnacks Segment, Legacy Pinnacle, Margin Decline, Inflation, Brand Investment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The Refrigerated & Frozen segment showed very good margin expansion in the quarter. While the Legacy Pinnacle business was slightly accretive to the segment\\'s margins, the segment benefited from strong cost of goods sold realized productivity and synergies in the quarter., Refrigerated & Frozen Segment, Legacy Pinnacle, Margin Expansion, Cost of Goods Sold, Synergies, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The International segment\\'s decline in operating margin was primarily attributed to the impact of FX and the lower margin Pinnacle business being included in this segment. Operating margins improved for the quarter on an organic basis after excluding FX and M&A., International Segment, Operating Margin, Foreign Exchange, Organic Basis, M&A, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finally, the Foodservice business saw a nice margin expansion in the quarter as it continued to execute its value-over-volume strategy., Margin\\nExpansion, Value-Over-Volume Strategy, Foodservice Business, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 38 outlines the drivers of our Q1 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, Conagra\\'s adjusted EPS decreased $0.04. Approximately $0.02 of this decline were from divested businesses and $0.02 were from a decline in the Ardent Mills joint venture. The increase in adjusted operating profit and taxes offset the impact of increased interest expense and shares outstanding., Adjusted\\nDiluted EPS, Q1, Decrease, Divested Businesses, Ardent Mills Joint Venture, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 39 summarizes net debt and cash flow information and shows the solid progress we\\'ve made over the last four quarters to improve our balance sheet. Compared to the end of Q4 fiscal \\' 19, net debt was approximately flat as we used cash on hand to fund a reduction in gross debt of approximately $150 million during the quarter. This was in line with our expectations, given the quarterly seasonality of the business. In total, I\\'m happy with our progress to-date., Net Debt,\\nCash Flow, Balance Sheet, Gross Debt, Seasonality, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal \\'19 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal \\'20, we have reduced gross debt by over $1 billion [Phonetic]. And with the recently announced pending divestiture of our DSD snacks business, we\\'ll have some additional cash on hand for debt repayments after we close. As we\\'ve stated, we don\\'t need divestitures to achieve our deleveraging targets, but they can accelerate our progress., Gross\\nDebt, Deleveraging Targets, Divestitures, Cash on Hand, Pending Divestiture, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Overall, we remain on schedule with our fiscal \\'21 target of a net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.6 times to 3.5 times. As we\\'ve consistently said, we are committed to a solid investment grade credit rating., Net Debt,\\nTrailing 12 Months Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Fiscal \\'21 Target, Investment Grade Credit Rating, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As noted in our release, we are reaffirming our fiscal \\'20 guidance. Slide 40 outlines our fiscal \\'20 outlook across all metrics. Please note that the organic sales growth rate excludes the impact of the fiscal \\'20\\'s 53rd week. All other metrics on this slide, include the impact of the 53rd week. It is also important to note that the financial information included in our presentation today, includes the expected full fiscal year results of the DSD snacks business. As disclosed earlier this month, we expect this transaction to close by the end of the calendar year as it remains subject to customary closing conditions. The expected annualized impact from this divestiture is approximately $110 million of net sales and $0.02 of adjusted EPS., Fiscal \\'20 Guidance, Fiscal \\'20 Outlook, Organic Sales Growth Rate, 53rd Week\\nImpact, DSD Snacks Business Divestiture, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I\\'d also like to highlight that we continue to believe in the planning assumptions that we noted during our Q4 fiscal \\'19 call. Overall, we see fiscal \\'20 results being more heavily weighed -- weighted toward the second half. With respect to our organic net sales growth, our plan calls for higher innovation-related investment with retailers during the first half of fiscal \\'20, with investment peaking in the upcoming second quarter resulting in an expected second quarter gross margin coming in below our Q1 levels., Fiscal\\n\\'20 Results, Second Half Weight, Organic Net Sales Growth, Innovation-Related Investment, Gross\\nMargin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The related sales growth is weighted toward the second half of fiscal \\'20 as our distribution, trial and repeat builds throughout the year. We expect margins to improve during the second half of fiscal \\'20. Innovation related investment will be higher in the first half as I just mentioned. The impact of synergies will also increase as we move through the year helping margins. We expect Pinnacle to continue to be dilutive to our year-over-year total gross margin until we anniversary the acquisition in late October., Second Half Weight, Sales Growth, Innovation-Related Investment, Synergies,\\nPinnacle Acquisition, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finally, in the second half, we will be lapping the higher levels of interest expense and share count, allowing for easier comparisons., Second\\nHalf Comparison, Interest Expense, Share Count, Easier Comparisons, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2020, 1, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, That concludes my remarks. Thank you for listening. I\\'ll now pass it to the operator as Sean, Tom McGough Darren Serrao and I are ready to take your questions., Thanking,\\nPassing to Operator, Taking Questions, Remarks Concluded, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. We have a lot to discuss. So let\\'s start with what I want you to take away from today., Good\\nMorning, Joining Earnings Call, Taking Away, Starting Discussion, Lot to Discuss, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, First, we remain confident that we will deliver long-term value by continuing to implement the Conagra Way to profitable growth. Our unwavering commitment to the Conagra Way will serve both Legacy Conagra and Pinnacle well into the future. Fiscal 2019, was a year of remarkable transition. We did a major deal that required more attention than originally anticipated. But I\\'m pleased to report that we continue to make progress stabilizing the Pinnacle business. We hit several key integration milestones and our deleveraging initiative is on track., Conagra\\nWay, Fiscal 2019 Transition, Pinnacle Business, Integration Milestones, Deleveraging Initiative, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you saw in our release this morning, our Q4 results were disappointing. This was largely due to discrete issues on a few businesses, as a result of non-economic behavior from competitors, as well as unfavorable market conditions for our Ardent Mills joint venture. These issues accelerated late in the quarter and we see them as transitory headwinds., Discrete\\nIssues, Non-Economic Behavior, Unfavorable Market Conditions, Q4 Results, Transitory Headwinds, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now, I\\'m going to unpack the drivers of our Q4 performance in a moment. But before I do, I want to comment on the year. Because fiscal 2019 -- in fiscal 2019, we took several very important steps, both organic and inorganic to enhance the long-term health of our business. This will help us play offense in fiscal 2020 as we bring to market another robust slate of on-trend innovation. That innovation is also a major factor in reiterating our earnings guidance and increasing our organic growth guidance for fiscal 2020., Fiscal 2019 Steps, Q4 Performance, Innovation, Earnings Guidance, Organic Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dave will provide more guidance information later. I\\'ll wrap up by sharing some thoughts on our opportunities within plant-based meat alternatives. Now that we own Gardein, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the explosive growth in this exciting space. So before I jump into the details of the quarter, I want to frame-up the big picture., Opportunities in Plant-Based Meat Alternatives, Explosive Growth, Capitalizing on Ownership,\\nQuarterly Details, Frame-Up Big Picture, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Fiscal 2019 was transformative for us, and we made very good progress securing our foundation during the year. We significantly advanced the Conagra Way playbook by deploying our principles across the portfolio. Our principles dictate that it\\'s important to be lean, so you can be agile but that you can\\'t cut your way to prosperity. Growth is essential and not all growth is equal. The consumer has to be top of mind and innovation capability counts., Fiscal\\n2019 Transformation, Conagra Way Playbook, Lean Principles, Agility, Consumer Top of Mind, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Fiscal 2019 also brought the launch of our largest innovation slate to-date. Along with an emphasis on supporting our brands with efficient marketing programs. As a result, you can see we\\'ve had sustained consumption growth over the past two years. We also delivered organic net sales growth for the second year in a row. Our disciplined approach to innovation and brand building, particularly across our Frozen and Snacking portfolios is paying off. The result has provided us with a rock solid foundation from which to deliver on our new long-term growth algorithm., Fiscal\\n2019 Innovation Slate, Emphasis on Marketing Programs, Sustained Consumption Growth, Organic Net\\nSales Growth, Long-Term Growth Algorithm, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our successful completion of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition during the year accelerated the next wave of change in Conagra. Pinnacle was an obvious fit that increased our scale, enhanced our Frozen platform and added leading iconic brands in attractive categories. We\\'ve made tremendous progress integrating the businesses, realizing synergies and positioning Pinnacle\\'s big three brands for our return to growth. We also continued to reshape our overall portfolio for better growth and better margins during fiscal \\'19 by divesting non-core assets., Pinnacle Foods Acquisition, Scale, Frozen Platform, Leading Brands, Portfolio\\nReshaping, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s take a closer look at the Pinnacle business. Starting with the integration on slide 9, we achieved a critical milestone at the end of the fiscal year. We successfully transitioned Pinnacle\\'s Legacy order-to-cash and financial ERP systems onto Conagra\\'s SAP platform. This took a tremendous effort by the integration team, and it went off without a hitch. In fact across the board, the integration continues to run smoothly and our synergy capture remains on schedule. Since the transaction closed in late October, we have recognized $31 million of synergies., Integration, Synergies, Order-to-Cash Systems, Financial ERP Systems, Schedule, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, From a balance sheet perspective, I\\'m pleased to report that we remain on track with our deleveraging plan, having reduced debt by $450 million in the fourth quarter, and $886 million from the close of the acquisition through the end of the fiscal year. We remain fully committed to achieving our goal of a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.6 times to 3.5 times in fiscal 2021 and maintaining a solid investment grade credit rating., Debt Reduction, Deleveraging Plan, Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Leverage Ratio,\\nCredit Rating, Investment Grade, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to business performance, the Legacy Pinnacle business came in at the high end of our net sales guidance, and operating profit expectations in the quarter. I\\'m very happy to report that the big three brands, Birds Eye, Wish-Bone and Duncan Hines, all progressed toward stabilization in Q4. We\\'ve begun to implement our value over volume playbook with the Pinnacle portfolio. And overall, we feel good about our progress just seven months after closing this major strategic acquisition., Business\\nPerformance, Net Sales Guidance, Operating Profit Expectations, Value Over Volume Playbook, Progress\\nAfter Acquisition, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As expected, the implementation of our value over volume approach resulted in short-term sales declines as we pruned the low performing SKUs to clear the decks for our new innovations. The good news is that the products in the market are performing well. The increase in base sales velocities as shown in the graphic on the right, demonstrate that our approach is working. We\\'re building a stronger base on which to layer new innovations coming to the market later this year., Value\\nOver Volume Approach, Sales Declines, Product Performance, Base Sales Velocities, New Innovations, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s move on to the Legacy Conagra business. While we\\'re confident in our long-term trajectory, and as fiscal 2019 overall positioned us well for the future, our financial results for Q4 did not meet our expectations. Our Q4 results were hampered by several unique items, each of which we will unpack for you today. Q4 organic net sales growth in the Legacy Conagra business missed our guidance by 240 basis points, which equates to about $43 million. The unexpected items that drove this shortfall included negative impacts of intensified promotional competition in our Hunt\\'s, Chef Boyardee and Marie Callender\\'s businesses. This drove about three-fourths of our sales miss this quarter. We view this as a transitory renting of market share that happens from time-to-time. We are not going to let these near-term events disrupt our disciplined approach to brand building., Legacy Conagra Business, Financial Results, Organic Net Sales Growth, Unique\\nItems, Brand Building, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also experienced some unexpected manufacturing and co-packer related challenges in the quarter. These issues were one-off in nature, and have been addressed. Our EPS miss was primarily due to these items combined with weak performance in our Ardent Mills joint venture during the quarter, driven by lower than expected weak prices and a lack of market volatility., EPS Miss,\\nManufacturing Challenges, Co-Packer Related Issues, Ardent Mills Joint Venture Performance, Market\\nVolatility, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s take a closer look at how this merchandising dynamic affected our Marie Callender\\'s brand. Fiscal \\'19 was an important year for Marie Callender\\'s, as we undertook significant changes to modernize the brand and improve profitability. These changes included adding modern attributes and flavor profiles with simplified higher quality ingredients, transitioning from trays to goals (ph), rightsizing portions and optimizing lower performing SKUs. As a result of these changes, the underlying brand health is far better and our new Marie Callender\\'s items have significantly higher velocities than the meals they replaced. Unfortunately, some of our competitors took a different approach in recent months, and prioritized short-term growth via heavy promotion., Brand\\nModernization, Marie Callender\\'s, Ingredients, Portion Optimization, Competition, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 14 highlights, one example, where our competitor\\'s product was discounted to drive significant incremental or promoted growth. As we move through the fourth quarter, our competition became more aggressive on price and displaced some of the very valuable merchandising support that we had anticipated from Marie Callender\\'s. We don\\'t believe that the short-term renting of our market share is a sustainable way to compete. We\\'ll stay true to the Conagra Way playbook and our principled approach. Holding fast to principles can be difficult, especially when competitors are making different choices, and heading down a path that could be viewed as profitless prosperity., Competition,\\nPrice Discounts, Merchandising Support, Conagra Way Playbook, Principled Approach, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We will not adopt a volume over value approach here, and will not return to the old habits that we\\'ve worked so hard to eradicate. But we may from time to time, take short-term actions to protect our share as we look to continue to build for the long term. We also experienced some unanticipated effects of our disciplined approach to pricing in our Grocery portfolio. As you can see on slide 15, the cost of steel cans increased 14% year-over-year. As we took inflation justified pricing on Hunt\\'s and Chef Boyardee to partially offset the increased cost, we experienced higher than expected volume declines. In our Hunt\\'s canned tomato business, our pricing actions translated to shelf price increases., Disciplined\\nApproach, Pricing Strategies, Cost of Steel Cans, Volume Declines, Long-term Building, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Last quarter, we said that we saw a competition announcing price increases, and you can see that reflected in all other increase of 4.5%. But what we did not anticipate is that private label would stay flat, and in some instances actually decrease price. By the end of the quarter, price gaps were simply too wide for consumers to ignore, and we lost volume. Similarly, on Chef Boyardee, we took price increases throughout the year. In Q4, the elasticity impacts of these increases were exacerbated by a decrease in merchandising support that was beyond our expectations. Each of these brands, Marie Callender\\'s, Hunt\\'s and Chef Boyardee has a leadership role in its respective category., Competition,\\nPrice Increases, Elasticity Impacts, Merchandising Support, Brand Leadership, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, When on-shelf price gaps grow too wide or merchandising becomes uncompetitive, volume can be impacted quickly, and significantly in the short term windows, and that was the case in Q4. In response, we will not change our principles. We continue to believe that profitable growth is key and historically aggressive pricing actions have proven to be unsustainable, but we will remain agile in the face of hyper promotional behavior by the competition, and will tactically defend our share where it makes sense., Profitable\\nGrowth, Principles, Aggressive Pricing, Hyper Promotional Behavior, Share Defense, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our second transitory factor that impacted us in Q4 was manufacturing and co-packer issues. P.F. Chang\\'s, Duke\\'s and Peter Pan were affected by isolated production challenges during the quarter. Importantly, we are confident that we have the right resources in place to manage food safety and quality issues across the enterprise. Root cause for each of these issues has been identified and properly addressed and the related customer service disruptions have been corrected and restored., Manufacturing\\nIssues, Co-Packer Challenges, Food Safety, Quality Control, Customer Service Disruptions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, our Q4 EPS was also impacted by weakness in the Ardent Mills joint venture. Ardent Mills profit eroded during the quarter, lower than anticipated wheat prices and reduced volatility in the wheat markets negatively impacted Ardent\\'s results. Q4 presented a variety of headwinds to navigate. Ultimately, our results did not meet our expectations. But we were not thrown off course. While we had our challenges, there were also clear signs of continued progress during the quarter. With respect to our Legacy Conagra business, Q4 saw a continuation of the strong performance in our Snacks business and positive results from frozen single-serve meals that we have talked about all year. We also delivered solid performance in our International and Foodservice segments during the quarter., Q4 EPS, Ardent\\nMills Joint Venture, Wheat Prices, Headwinds, Continued Progress, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, we over delivered our free cash flow target for the year, and remain on track with our deleveraging goals. Dave will add more detail on our strong cash flow during his remarks. Slide 19, shows the continued growth in total sales and average weekly TPDs in our frozen single-serve meals portfolio., Free Cash\\nFlow, Deleveraging Goals, Cash Flow, Total Sales, Average Weekly TPDs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Notably, in Q4 we lapped the 13% growth we delivered in Q4 of fiscal 2018, which was one of the best quarters we\\'ve ever had in frozen single-serve meals. We still delivered nearly 6% growth on top of that this quarter. So, as we look at the continuing trends in our sales in this key category, as well as the trends in TPDs, we\\'re very pleased with our progress. Our approach is not only having a positive impact on our results. It\\'s also driving overall category growth in frozen single-serve meals., Q4 Growth,\\nFrozen Single-Serve Meals, Sales Trends, TPDs, Category Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our competition is aware of this growth and they certainly want in on the action. We believe it\\'s part of why we\\'re seeing some of the unsustainable promotional activity. Our strategy is not driven by price, but a rigorous approach to modernizing and premiumizing our brands through renovation and innovation., Modernization,\\nPremiumization, Renovation, Unsustainable Promotional Activity, Competition, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, You can see on slide 21, that our innovation is driving growth and performing far better than that of our key competitors. Let\\'s turn to our Snacks business, which continues to exceed our expectations. Slide 22, details the growth we delivered in Q4, which included contributions from every key snacking vertical; popcorn, meat snacks, sweet treats, and seeds. Overall, retail dollars sales in our Legacy Conagra snacking portfolio grew 12.6% on a two year basis in the fourth quarter. You can see a sustained improvement in our performance following last year\\'s NACS Show, where we unveiled our new approach to snacks., Innovation,\\nSnacks Business, Growth, Competition, Performance Improvement, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our International segment performed extremely well throughout fiscal \\' 19, and in the fourth quarter in particular. These strong results have been driven by our successful efforts to reinvent frozen meals in Canada, drive snacks growth in Mexico, modernize iconic brands internationally and implement our value over volume strategy to realize the power of our strong brand equities. The continued execution of our value over volume strategy also benefit our Foodservice segment in the quarter. We\\'re continuing to build a higher quality revenue base in our Foodservice segment, and accomplishing considerable margin expansion., International\\nSegment, Strong Results, Value Over Volume Strategy, Brand Equities, Foodservice Segment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Next one, I\\'ll spend some time previewing our robust innovation slate for fiscal 2020. Slide 26, shows just some of the Frozen innovation we have in store for this year. Yet again, we\\'ll be delivering products with modern brand attributes, simplified labels, and ingredients and bold flavor profiles. Retailers have responded very well to these products, some of which we\\'ll start shipping soon. We expect to see these products reaching the marketplace in the first half of fiscal 2020, and hitting their full stride in the second half., Innovation,\\nFrozen Products, Brand Attributes, Label Simplification, Ingredients and Flavor Profiles, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We have plans to continue to build upon our snacking success in fiscal 2020, with the launch of our strongest lineup of snacking innovation to date. That includes these provocative new meat snacks with bold flavors, new forms and optimized price pack architecture. We\\'re also launching our salty snacks into neglected and growing coves of the market, where we can extend our brands through innovation., Snacking\\nSuccess, Innovation, Bold Flavors, Price Pack Architecture, Salty Snacks, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re reframing our Sweet Treats brands to unlock significant growing demand spaces that meet modern trends. We\\'re reinvigorating Snack Pack, and reaching out to Hispanic audiences with products like the co-branded FANTA gels (ph) you see here. With this innovation, we clearly have confidence that our snacking portfolio will maintain its momentum in fiscal 2020., Modern Trends,\\nGrowing Demand, Snack Pack, Hispanic Audiences, Innovation Confidence, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also have big plans for the Pinnacle portfolio, you can see some of those upcoming innovations on slide 30. We believe we have a tremendous opportunity to contemporize our newly acquired leadership brands to capitalize on key growth pockets. One area of the Pinnacle portfolio, where we now see far greater growth in innovation opportunities than previously forecast is the Gardein brand. I\\'m sure you\\'ve seen all the recent attention on the plant-based meat alternatives space., Innovation\\nOpportunities, Contemporization, Growth Pockets, Plant-Based Meat Alternatives, Gardein Brand, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We think there is no brand that better illustrates the enormous long-term opportunity ahead than Gardein, a real jewel in the portfolio that we haven\\'t spent a lot of time talking to you about or capitalizing on end market. Gardein has a solid presence in Foodservice and a leadership role in plant-based meat alternatives at retail. Here\\'s how we\\'re thinking about this exciting high growth space between now and fiscal 2022., Gardein Brand,\\nPlant-Based Meat Alternatives, Foodservice, Retail, Fiscal 2022, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We start by sizing the total opportunity. Based on our analysis of product substitution in other categories, almond milk for cow\\'s milk as an example, we can reasonably predict the opportunity for plant-based meat alternatives. And here\\'s where it gets really exciting, because the opportunity shouldn\\'t be viewed as just a percentage of fresh meat. We think the opportunity is a percentage of all foods that contain meat. Based on this view, our analysis shows that plant-based meat alternatives could achieve a 15% share of both of these market segments. That means the opportunity here, could be in the range of $30 billion just in the US. And you know there\\'s even more opportunity internationally. So the financials are compelling. I think many of you may be surprised by the numbers on slide 33, showing just how large the Gardein brand is already. It has quadrupled in size over the past four years, and is now the second largest brand in the meat alternative space with annual sales of more than $170 million at retail and across Foodservice channels., Opportunity,\\nPlant-Based Meat Alternatives, Market Share, Financials, Gardein Brand, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Importantly, we will be well positioned to support continued growth, because we have new capacity coming online in the coming months. These expanded resources are already well under way and we expect them to be operational in the fall of 2019. And we anticipate that capacity will be used to produce more than just burgers. While plant-based burgers are getting a lot of press these days, it\\'s instructive to take a step back and look at what\\'s really going on in meat consumption., Capacity,\\nGrowth, Production, Meat Consumption, Press, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 35 outlines overall consumption of animal proteins. The numbers to the right of the bars demonstrate the average annual number of meals eaten per person by type of animal proteins. As you can see, burgers are important, but this market extends well beyond beef patties or even beef. Chicken is by far the most popular animal protein in the US, both in home and away from home. I would also highlight the significant consumption of pork, hot dogs and fish., Consumption, Animal Proteins, Meals, Market, Types, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Importantly, eating occasions for animal protein covered all dayparts. Our view is that the relative size of animal protein consumption serves as a useful guide for how to think about the market opportunity for plant-based alternatives. And if you\\'re wondering whether chicken eaters are really interested in trying plant-based alternatives, the answer is clearly yes., Eating\\nOccasions, Animal Protein Consumption, Market Opportunity, Plant-Based Alternatives, Chicken Eaters, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 36 focuses just on the plant-based meat alternative space within the retail channel. As you can see here, plant-based alternatives to beef are the largest protein alternative today, driven by the fact that products like veggie burgers have been available at retail for a long time. However, alternatives to chicken have built a substantial beachhead and this space is the fastest growing plant-based alternative by far., Plant-\\nBased Meat Alternatives, Retail Channel, Beef, Chicken, Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We believe that over the next several years, Gardein is extremely well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of plant-based meat alternatives. The brand already provides a diversified portfolio of products, particularly in the under-appreciated alternative to chicken segment. And if there is a segment of the meat space that the consumers care about, there is a good chance that Gardein is already there or will be soon with a deliciously meat-free product. This includes offerings across all dayparts., Growth,\\nPlant-Based Meat Alternatives, Gardein, Chicken, Dayparts, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also going to expand Gardein\\'s reach. Gardein is well-established and well-known, but we see plenty of opportunities to grow this brand. First up, is an improved burger. Gardein\\'s corn burger platform is under-developed, and we are in the process of creating the next generation of beefless burger to better compete in this popular segment. As we do this, we expect accelerated growth at retail and in Foodservice. But we also plan to compete across the important Hot Dog and Sausage categories., Growth,\\nExpansion, Brand, Burger, Retail, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We believe the winner in each of these categories will have the best taste, appearance and aroma, which is what we\\'re focusing on delivering across our plant-based alternative portfolio. What we believe Conagra can do better than anyone else is leverage iconic brands, superior culinary capabilities and proven innovation muscle to reach consumers across multiple categories in plant-based protein. During our Investor Day, you heard me talk about a key tenant of the Conagra Way to profitable growth. Iconic brands plus modern attributes equals superior velocities and that formula is perfect for this space., Taste,\\nAppearance, Aroma, Brands, Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Across Foodservice and retail channels of trade, we believe that Conagra Brands leveraging and co-branded with Gardein is ideally positioned. We have the best culinary capability, differentiated packaging and the broadest portfolio of power brands to leverage. Gardein contributes the modern benefit. Overall, we\\'re excited about the opportunities in plant-based meat alternatives. This together with our entire innovation pipeline will help us reach our long-term algorithm., Foodservice, Retail, Brands, Innovation, Long-Term Algorithm, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, Sean M. Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Looking ahead, we remain confident that we\\'ll continue to deliver quality long-term growth at Conagra by implementing the Conagra way, and prioritizing value over volume. We will continue to introduce on trend innovation to the marketplace. We\\'ll also continue to execute our Pinnacle action plan including leveraging the Gardein brand to tap into the plant-based meat alternative opportunity. We expect the market will continue to be highly dynamic. We will need to stay both principle-based and agile, as we remain committed to delivering our guidance and navigate a dynamic marketplace. But notwithstanding a difficult Q4, we\\'re confident that we will meet our fiscal 2020 guidance and deliver on our long-term goals., Conagra\\nWay, Innovation, Gardein, Long-Term Growth, Dynamic Market, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Sean. And good morning everyone. This morning, I\\'ll walk through Q4 and fiscal year 2019 for both the Legacy Conagra and Pinnacle businesses, before we open it up for questions., Q4,\\nFiscal Year 2019, Legacy Conagra, Pinnacle Businesses, Questions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 42 outlines our performance for the quarter and the full fiscal year. I\\'ll walk through more detail in a moment, but I\\'ll start here by hitting the key points. Compared to the year-ago period, net sales for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year were up 32.9% and 20.2% respectively, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. Organic net sales excluding Trenton were down 0.7% for the quarter. While the quarter did not come in as we expected, we believe the issues in the quarter are transitory as Sean discussed and do not impact our fiscal year \\'20 guidance or long-term algorithm. Despite the Q4 challenges, we delivered organic net sales growth of 0.3% for the fiscal year, which is above last year\\'s organic growth rate., Net\\nSales, Organic Growth, Acquisition, Fiscal Year Guidance, Long-Term Algorithm, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted operating profit was up 25.7% in the fourth quarter, and up 23.4% for the full year. These increases are primarily driven by the inclusion of Pinnacle\\'s profit. A few points on margins. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 13.2% and full-year was 15.4%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year and above our guidance range. While adjusted gross margin decreased for the full year, adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points. This relationship reflects the gross margin impact of our ongoing shift of marketing investments from A&P to above the line retail marketing. As well as leverage at the SG&A line, where we have benefited from our commitment to a lean operating environment and Pinnacle synergies., Adjusted\\nOperating Profit, Margins, Gross Margin, Marketing Investments, Lean Operating Environment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 22.2% versus the previous year. While full fiscal year, adjusted EBITDA rose 16.7% to approximately $1.9 billion, reflecting the inclusion of approximately seven months of Pinnacle\\'s results. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.36 for the quarter, down 28% from the prior year. For the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.01, down 4.7% as the Q4 transitory items and the shortfall in Ardent Mills negatively impacted our performance versus expectations., Adjusted\\nEBITDA, Diluted EPS, Quarterly Performance, Full-Year Performance, Transitory Items, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 43 outlines the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year net sales changes versus the same periods a year ago. It should be noted that for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year, we saw improvements in price mix, even after taking into account our increases in retailer investments to support brand building., Price Mix,\\nRetailer Investments, Brand Building, Fourth Quarter Performance, Full-Year Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Slide 44, provides a summary of net sales by segment for the quarter and fiscal year 2019. For the quarter, Grocery & Snacks net sales and Organic net sales declined 7.1% and 2.5% respectively. As the divestiture of the Wesson oil business subtracted 460 basis points from the net sales growth rate. Despite continued strong end market performance by our snacking businesses, net sales were impacted by the Q4 transitory items as Sean discussed., Grocery &\\nSnacks, Organic Net Sales, Divestiture, Transitory Items, End Market Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, For the full fiscal year, Grocery & Snacks, Organic net sales remained largely in line with the prior year. The Refrigerated and Frozen segment continued to benefit from innovation during Q4 across multiple brands, including Banquet, Healthy Choice, Marie Callender\\'s and Reddi-wip. However, these benefits were more than offset by lower than expected merchandising support on Marie Callender\\'s, the P.F. Chang\\'s manufacturing challenges that resulted in a recall and to a lesser extent continued declines in certain refrigerated businesses. These headwinds, led to a decrease in reported and organic net sales in Q4., Grocery &\\nSnacks, Organic Net Sales, Refrigerated and Frozen Segment, Merchandising Support, Manufacturing\\nChallenges, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, For the full year, however, the segment reported good growth with net sales and organic net sales up 1.9% and 0.9% respectively. As Sean mentioned, the implementation of our Conagra playbook led to improved results in International for the quarter and full year. The segment\\'s fourth quarter reported numbers were impacted by the divestitures of the Canadian Del Monte business and Wesson oil business, which combined to reduce the net sales growth rate by approximately 10.2%. The segment was also negatively impacted 2.8% by foreign exchange., Conagra\\nPlaybook, International Segment, Divestitures, Foreign Exchange, Reported Numbers, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Notwithstanding these factors, International\\'s organic net sales were up 5.6% for the quarter, and up 3.7% for the full year. For the quarter, the Foodservice segments reported and organic net sales were down 12.6% and 0.6% respectively. The sale of the Trenton facility and divestiture of the Wesson oil business reduced the net sales growth rate by 12% in the aggregate. The segment\\'s Q4 organic net sales results reflect continued execution of our value over volume strategy and the impact of inflation justified pricing. Volume declined 5.9% in the quarter but price mix increased 5.3%. Organic net sales were down 2.7% for the full year., International Segment, Foodservice Segments, Value Over Volume Strategy, Inflation Justified\\nPricing, Full-Year Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle sales for the quarter and full fiscal year were $756 million and $1.7 billion respectively, in line with our expectations for the quarter and full year. Slide 45, outlines the puts and takes on our Q4 and full year adjusted gross margin versus the prior year. It\\'s important to keep in mind that for Q4, the 1% benefit you see on the left side of the page includes a headwind of approximately 50 basis points related to the isolated manufacturing challenges and recalls we experienced during the quarter., Pinnacle\\nSales, Adjusted Gross Margin, Quarterly Performance, Full-Year Performance, Manufacturing Challenges\\nand Recalls, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Moving to slide 46, you can see that Legacy Conagra adjusted operating profit decreased 9.2% during the quarter, and Legacy Conagra\\'s adjusted operating margin was 13.4%. Total adjusted operating profit including Pinnacle increased 25.7% in Q4. In the Grocery & Snacks segment, adjusted operating profit was down in Q4 due to the loss of profit associated with the divestiture of the Wesson oil business, as well as higher transportation and packaging costs primarily in metal packaging., Legacy\\nConagra, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Operating Margin, Grocery & Snacks Segment,\\nDivestiture, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The Grocery & Snacks segment was also negatively impacted by the manufacturing challenges we faced in the quarter. The Refrigerated and Frozen segment\\'s adjusted operating profit decreased 6.1% in Q4. Realized productivity improvements were offset by lower net sales in part due to the manufacturing and merchandising impacts we discussed earlier, as well as higher transportation and input costs. The Foodservice segment\\'s adjusted operating profit increased 4% in Q4, while operating margin expanded to 12.2%, due to the impact of favorable price mix, supply chain realized productivity and the sale of the lower margin business produced in our Trenton facility., Grocery & Snacks\\nSegment, Manufacturing Challenges, Refrigerated and Frozen Segment, Foodservice Segment, Realized\\nProductivity Improvements, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle\\'s adjusted operating profit, including the corporate expense related to Pinnacle totaled $95 million for the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 12.6%, in line with our expectations. On slide 47, you can see that Legacy Conagra adjusted operating profit increased 1.2% for the full year, and Legacy Conagra\\'s adjusted operating margin increased by 43 basis points to 15.4%. The Pinnacle segment\\'s adjusted operating profit totaled $264 million, and adjusted operating margin was 15.3% above our fiscal year \\'19 guidance range of 14.6% to 14.9% ., Pinnacle\\nSegment, Legacy Conagra, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Operating Margin, Full-Year\\nPerformance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Total Conagra adjusted operating profit was up 23.4% versus a year ago. And adjusted operating margin was 15.4% above our fiscal year \\'19 guidance range of 14.9% to 15.2%. Slide 48, outlines the drivers of our adjusted EPS decrease versus Q4 a year ago. As you can see, Legacy Conagra adjusted EPS decreased $0.07. Approximately $0.02 of this decline was from divested businesses, $0.02 was from the manufacturing challenges discussed, $0.02 was from a larger-than-expected decline in Ardent Mills, and $0.02 was from lower pension and post-retirement service income resulting from fully funding the pension plan in fiscal 2018, which we have now wrapped as we head into fiscal \\'20,, Total Conagra,\\nAdjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Operating Margin, Legacy Conagra, Drivers of Adjusted EPS\\nDecline, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The Pinnacle acquisition reduced total company adjusted EPS by $0.07 during the quarter. Slide 49, outlines the drivers of our 4.7% decrease in full year adjusted EPS versus a year ago. Adjusted EPS for Legacy ConAgra increased $0.04 for the year, despite $0.08 of headwind from the reduced pension retirement service income I just mentioned, and $0.06 of headwind from Ardent Mills., Pinnacle\\nAcquisition, Adjusted EPS Decrease, Legacy ConAgra, Drivers of Adjusted EPS Decline, Ardent Mills, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, The Pinnacle acquisition reduced total company adjusted EPS by $0.14 for fiscal 2019. Slide 50, summarizes net debt and cash flow information, and demonstrates the clear progress we continued to make in enhancing our overall financial position this year. Overall, we remain on schedule with our fiscal \\'21 target of a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.6 times to 3.5 times., Pinnacle\\nAcquisition, Net Debt and Cash Flow, Financial Position, Fiscal \\'21 Target, Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Between the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in Q2 and fiscal year-end, we reduced total debt by $886 million. And our estimated ratio for pro forma net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.88 times as of the end of fiscal \\'19. For the full fiscal year, Conagra generated $761 million of free cash flow, exceeding our guidance of $700 million. As we consistently state, we are committed to solid investment grade credit ratings., Between\\nPinnacle Acquisition, Net Debt and Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, Pro Forma Net Debt to Trailing\\n12-Month Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Commitment to Investment Grade Credit Ratings, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, As noted in our release, we are essentially reaffirming our fiscal \\'20 EPS guidance this morning. On slide 51, you can see that we\\'ve reduced our estimated fiscal \\'20 earnings by $0.02, solely to remove the historical profit contribution from the now divested Gelit business. Excluding the adjustment for Gelit, our earnings guidance range has not changed from what we provided at the Company\\'s Investor Day in April 2019., Fiscal \\'20\\nEPS Guidance, Historical Profit Contribution from Gelit, Adjustment for Gelit, Earning Guidance\\nRange, Company\\'s Investor Day, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, And slide 52, outlines our fiscal 2020 outlook across all metrics. We are updating our organic net sales guidance to be in the range of 1% to 1.5% compared to our prior expectation of approximately 1%, provided at Investor Day. Note that this growth rate excludes the impact of the fiscal \\' 20\\'s 53rd week. All other metrics on this slide, include the impact of the 53rd week. We expect adjusted operating margin to improve to a range of 16.2% to 16.8% in fiscal \\'20. As we continue the integration of Pinnacle to generate estimated synergies while implementing the Conagra Way playbook., Slide 52, Fiscal\\n2020 Outlook, Organic Net Sales Guidance, Adjusted Operating Margin, Conagra Way Playbook, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Also, we expect free cash flow to continue to improve in fiscal \\'20, benefiting from the expected Pinnacle cost synergies, and the expected increase in organic net sales. We expect free cash flow to reach approximately $1 billion for fiscal \\'20. Importantly, we also remain committed to the long-term algorithm we provided at our Investor Day. As our financial progress accelerates through fiscal year \\'22, and we benefit from the full synergy opportunity of the Pinnacle acquisition, we look to capitalize on new sources of growth like the Gardein opportunity Sean highlighted earlier., Fiscal \\'20\\nFree Cash Flow Guidance, Pinnacle Cost Synergies, Organic Net Sales Growth, Long-term Algorithm,\\nGardein Opportunity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, To conclude my formal remarks today, I\\'d like to turn to slide 53. Here, I\\'d summarize the more important planning assumptions that underpin our fiscal year \\'20 guidance. These can be broken into two buckets, organic growth and margins. Overall, we see results being more heavily weighted toward the second half of fiscal \\'20. With respect to our organic net sales growth, we anticipate higher innovation related investment during the first half of fiscal \\'20. With the related sales growth weighted toward the second half as our distribution, trial and repeat builds throughout the year., Organic\\nGrowth, Margins, Planning Assumptions, First Half of Fiscal \\'20, Second Half of Fiscal \\'20, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We also expect a highly promotional environment in select categories that we experienced in Q4 to continue in the near term. As Sean mentioned, we have seen these situations before and will remain agile in how we respond to competition. Consistent with what we\\'ve been saying since December, we continue to expect Legacy Pinnacle sales trends to improve in the second half of fiscal \\'20. We also expect margins to improve during the second half of fiscal \\'20 as the innovation related investment will be higher in the first half as I just mentioned. And for Pinnacle, by the second half of fiscal \\'20, we expect to lap the elevated input cost inflation in transportation and costs that the business had been experiencing., Promotional Environment, Legacy Pinnacle Sales Trends, Second Half of Fiscal \\'20, Innovation\\nRelated Investment, Elevated Input Cost Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, We also expect synergies to increase as we move through the course of the year. Finally, we expect Pinnacle will continue to be dilutive to our year-over-year gross margin, until we anniversary the acquisition in late October., Synergies,\\nYear-over-Year Gross Margin, Acquisition Anniversary, Pinnacle Dilution, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 4, David S. Marberger, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you for listening. That concludes my remarks. I\\'ll now pass it to the operator as Sean, Tom McGough, Darren Serrao and I are ready to take your questions., Thank You,\\nRemarks, Passing to Operator, Questions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. There\\'s a lot to cover this morning; we have strong Legacy Conagra results to discuss, a positive Pinnacle integration update to share, deleveraging to discuss, and a preview of our April 10th Investor Day. But the most important takeaway from everything Dave and I will discuss today is what these results mean, the Conagra Way to profitable growth delivers. The impact of our unwavering commitment to the Conagra Way over the past several years has been consistent progress, most recently resulting in the continued strong momentum in core Legacy Conagra Brands during the third quarter, particularly in our leading frozen and snacks businesses. We are now aggressively applying this approach to Pinnacle and it\\'s working to keep the technical integration on track as well as driving a reinvigorated innovation lineup., Legacy\\nConagra Results, Pinnacle Integration Update, Deleveraging, Investor Day, The Conagra Way, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we said in Q2, we expect that innovation to lead to improved Pinnacle trends in the second half of fiscal 2020. It also enabled us to gain traction on delevering. In the short five months since closing the Pinnacle transaction, we\\'ve reduced debt by $685 million. Overall, we are confident we will deliver quality long-term growth at Conagra and we\\'ll share our robust innovation pipeline and new long-term financial algorithm on April 10th along with details of the increased cost synergy opportunities that we see. Before I get into the quarter, let me talk a bit more about the Conagra Way. We\\'ll unpack this even further at Investor Day, but this playbook is our bedrock and you\\'ve seen us execute it for several years now. The Conagra Way to profitable growth is relentlessly principle based and firmly grounded in the consumer. It advocates that growth is essential and that we cannot and will not cut our way to prosperity., Innovation, Deleveraging, Growth, The Conagra Way, Investor Day, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, It acknowledges that our ability to build strong brands requires differentiated capabilities, particularly those that fuel innovation; areas like demand science, precision marketing, and omni-commerce. And the Conagra Way recognizes that our success requires a highly disciplined approach to portfolio management, which you\\'ve seen us execute consistently for the past four years. Importantly, our disciplined approach is repeatable and scalable. It built our healthy and growing frozen and snacks businesses and serves as the basis for how we\\'re approaching the rest of our portfolio, including Pinnacle. We\\'re confident about how we do things around here because it works. We don\\'t take shortcuts. We do things the right way, a way that best positions us for maximum value creation over the long haul. So, let\\'s talk more about the results the Conagra Way delivered in Q3., Differentiated Capabilities, Disciplined Approach, Portfolio Management, The Conagra Way, Long-Term\\nValue Creation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, First up is the Legacy Conagra business. We continued to deliver good consumption growth in our Legacy Conagra segments in the quarter with strong trends on both a year-over-year and two-year basis. As you can see on Slide 8, Legacy Conagra\\'s domestic retail segments had another good quarter. Q3 growth in our Legacy segments was once again based on solid fundamentals tied to the increasing strength of our brands. Our retail sales and base velocities remained in fertile territory and continued to gain momentum on a two-year basis. Turning to our segment results. Refrigerated & Frozen was up 240 basis points in the quarter with Frozen again delivering terrific growth, 490 basis points. Refrigerated was down but as I mentioned last quarter, apart from Reddi-wip, we have yet to renovate these brands and bring new innovation to the marketplace., Legacy\\nConagra Business, Consumption Growth, Segment Results, Brand Strength, Renovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Refrigerated is one of the final pieces of the Legacy Conagra portfolio to receive attention, but the work is well under way and you\\'ll see exciting new products on store shelves in 2019. But turning back to Frozen, we\\'ve talked a lot in prior quarters about the successful implementation of our playbook in Frozen. As you can see on Slide 10, that success continued in Q3. We reinvigorated and continued to lead the Frozen category and our fundamentals remained strong in the quarter with improvement in consumption trends, TPDs, and base sales velocity. Our approach is having a positive impact on our results and importantly, it\\'s also driving category growth in frozen single-serve meals. Our rigorous approach to modernizing and premiumizing our brands through renovation and innovation has delivered impact for Conagra and for our customers. While we began our innovation journey in Frozen more than a year ago and went broader and deeper in frozen in fiscal 2019, we have even more on the way., Frozen\\nBusiness, Legacy Conagra Portfolio, Renovation, Consumption Trends, Category Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In fiscal \\'20, we expect to have our most robust and powerful slate of innovation in this segment yet. The team has done a lot of great work to develop a strong multi-year pipeline of innovation across our Legacy Conagra frozen brands and across refrigerated brands like Hebrew National, Egg Beaters, and Reddi-wip. Turning to our Legacy Conagra Grocery & Snacks segment, we have more positive news to report. The snacks business grew by 8.2% during the quarter. This tremendous growth validates our recent investment in the business. Looking at our snacks business in more detail on Slide 14. The growth we delivered in Q3 came with contributions from every key snacking vertical; popcorn, meat snacks, sweet treats,and seeds. On a two-year basis, retail dollar sales for our Legacy Conagra snacking portfolio were up an impressive 14%. Dissecting the snacks growth which we\\'ve done on Slide 15; you\\'ll see that while TPD\\'s were down, base velocities increased significantly., Innovation,\\nLegacy Conagra Frozen Brands, Refrigerated Brands, Snacks Business, Two-Year Basis, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In other words, our growth in snacks during the quarter was driven by bringing terrific products to market that consumers wanted. Those products were in high demand and moved off shelves very quickly and growth through improved consumer pull is sustainable growth. Of course TPDs have been an important metric in assessing brand health historically, but TPDs are not always a helpful barometer of brand vitality. As an example, look at the Slim Jim results. Slim Jim is one of our healthiest brands and is driving strong snacks growth, but Slim Jim\\'s TPDs declined nearly 18% year-over-year as we optimized our assortment. With that data point alone, you\\'d think the brand was struggling, but it was not. Velocity was up more than 28% and the net result was a retail sales improvement of more than 7% in the quarter. Our Slim Jim business became stronger by increasing shelf inventory and facings on our best selling, fastest moving items and by pruning low velocity SKUs., Sustainable\\nGrowth, Consumer Pull, Brand Vitality, Optimization, Retail Sales Improvement, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, These actions led to higher sales for both Conagra and our customers and TPDs did not tell the story. We saw the exact same dynamic on Swiss Miss in Q3 and I share this because it\\'s a good reminder that TPD optimization does not always come through TPD growth. I\\'m very excited about the innovation that we deployed across snacks in the last year and even more excited about the impact of that innovation, but we\\'re not even close to being done. To the point I highlighted earlier regarding Refrigerated & Frozen, our innovation and renovation machine is humming and we have a terrific multi-year pipeline built out for the brands you see here. I won\\'t go further into it now, you\\'ll have to wait until Investor Day. So in summary on Legacy Conagra, we feel very good about our momentum. We\\'re pleased with the results we delivered in Q3 and are confident that with the Conagra Way, we\\'ll continue to deliver., Innovation, TPD\\nOptimization, Sales Growth, Customer Impact, Multi-Year Pipeline, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to Pinnacle priorities on Slide 18. It\\'s been a short five months since we completed our acquisition of Pinnacle, we\\'ve accomplished a great deal in that time with much more to come. I\\'ll spend a few minutes covering each of our focus areas, integrating the business; reinvigorating Birds Eye, Duncan Hines, and Wish-Bone via innovation; and deleveraging. First, let\\'s talk about the integration. I couldn\\'t be happier with our progress on this front so far. We\\'ve said all along that the similarities between Legacy Conagra and Pinnacle made a combination of our two companies an obvious opportunity and the fact that we\\'ve been able to quickly align our organizations and deliver our integration work plan to-date is evidence of how well the two companies mesh. Put a finer point on it, work transitions are on track and processes are being aligned; systems integration are well on their way with key milestones being hit; and importantly, we captured approximately $12 million of cost synergy in Q3 which paces ahead of our expectations., Integration,\\nInnovation, Deleveraging, Cost Synergy, Pinnacle Priorities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to expect to over deliver the $215 million of cost synergies we previously announced and we\\'ll share more detail on refined cost synergy opportunities next month. Thank you to the entire Conagra team across Legacy Conagra and Pinnacle for all their terrific work to-date on the integration. We\\'ve also been spending time in Q3 undertaking a concentrated effort to begin deploying the Conagra Way to the Pinnacle portfolio and first up is our proven value over volume philosophy. We are starting the process of cutting slower turning and lower margin SKUs while redesigning Pinnacle\\'s customer investments for better ROI. Retail sales and TPDs continued their downward trends in Q3, but base velocities improved as shown in the chart on the right. Non-investment grade SKUs were the ones being pruned in the quarter and that means that the Pinnacle products remaining on shelf are higher quality and generating consumer takeaway., Cost Synergies,\\nConagra Way, SKU Pruning, Retail Sales, Base Velocities, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we did with our Legacy Conagra business several years ago, we are creating a stronger foundation on which to build. While we won\\'t be happy until total retail sales begin to turn in the Pinnacle portfolio, we are confident that the value over volume process under way gives us that stronger foundation. As we introduce future innovation slates into the market, the net result will be more profitable sustainable growth. To be clear, our Pinnacle-related work is incredibly focused. Right now, it\\'s all about strengthening Pinnacles Big 3; Birds Eye, Duncan Hines, and Wish-Bone. Pinnacle historically referred to these brands as leadership brands and with good reason. However, in the second half of last year, each of these businesses struggled with executional issues. These challenges hurt sales and profit representing the vast majority of Pinnacle\\'s drop off on each., Stronger\\nFoundation, Total Retail Sales, Innovation Slate, Executional Issues, Second Half, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, While recent performance in these great brands has been below historical norms, as we discussed last quarter, we\\'re confident that we can reinvigorate them through great innovation and Q3 brought the beginning of our implementation of focused action plans for each brand. First, let\\'s talk about Birds Eye. Birds Eye is an iconic billion dollar brand previously the largest in the Pinnacle portfolio and now the largest in the Conagra portfolio. Recently, however, the Birds Eye brand was slow to respond to key consumer trends, opting out of innovating in important growth pockets. That is changing. The differentiating capabilities that come with the Conagra Way include a well-developed innovation muscle and the know-how to identify and capitalize on consumer trends. Applying these capabilities to Birds Eye means that we\\'re not only opting in to the innovation opportunities in this key category, but opting in in a big way., Birds Eye,\\nInnovation, Consumer Trends, Portfolio Size, Conagra Way, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Here again we\\'ve already built a multi-year pipeline of innovation and renovation that will deliver a sequenced deluge of new Birds Eye products. We\\'ll share a lot more in April. Now let\\'s turn to Duncan Hines. While Duncan Hines\\' recent results have been disappointing, it faces a different situation than Birds Eye. Recall the Duncan Hines brand actually did a fair amount of innovation over the past two years. The brand moved into broader snacking with a very innovative idea for Mug Cakes. With this innovation, the Pinnacle team was clearly heading in the right direction. However, the execution of that innovation was not up to our standards. Inefficient SKUs proliferated while competitors entered the space with a more provocative execution, generated better velocities, and gained share. And that new innovation from the competition caused Duncan Hines to suffer. The good news is that we see the solutions here as straightforward even if they\\'ll take a bit of time to cycle into the marketplace., Innovation,\\nExecution, Competition, Standards, Solutions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 23 shows how deploying the Conagra Way to Duncan Hines is leading to a restage of the product with simplified branding, a larger size impression, an optimized SKU range, and an upgraded product with the simple addition of the hero ingredient consumers want, frosting. And finally, let\\'s talk about Wish-Bone where the situation is again unique. In the summer of 2018 Wish-Bone labels were updated, but unfortunately the execution came up short. Despite a more modern design, the labels did not effectively communicate the flavor variety and variety communication is absolutely essential in salad dressing. Take a look at the picture on the left. The modernized label communication was flawed and sales velocities declined quickly and considerably following the label change. Fortunately, this issue has an obvious fix. The right side of Slide 24 shows our updated label. It prominently features the dressing variety., Deploying\\nConagra Way, Simplified Branding, Larger Size Impression, Optimized SKU Range, Hero Ingredient, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Again, a simple solution, but one that will take a bit of time to cycle into the marketplace. After it does, we believe that consumer takeaway for this iconic brand will improve. Overall, the health of the big three Pinnacle brands is critically important and you can be assured that our teams have spent the last five months incredibly focused on each of them. There is definitely more work to do and it will take some time for customers to add our new innovation into their shelf resets. Again as we said in Q2, we expect innovation to lead to improved Pinnacle trends in the second half of fiscal 2020. But the point I want you to take away today is that we have dug into what exactly ails each brand and we are squarely on top of the solutions. But topline growth isn\\'t our only focus, we\\'re also focused on improving margins across the Pinnacle portfolio and generating more cash from each dollar sold., Simple Solution,\\nFocused Work, Customer Innovation, Second Half Growth, Margin Improvement, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Over the last several years we\\'ve built capabilities that address each of the margin levers noted on Slide 25 and deployed them across the Legacy Conagra portfolio. And now we\\'re focused on getting Pinnacle\\'s gross margins back on track with solid realized productivity above our cost synergy initiatives, margin accretive innovation, improved pricing capabilities, a better brand mix, a better channel mix, and trade optimization. In other words, we\\'re intensely focused on infusing the Conagra Way into Pinnacle. Part of this is simply ensuring that our newest team members, those from Pinnacle, understand the fundamentals of our approach. I\\'ve always said that the cultures at Conagra and Pinnacle have many overlaps, particularly with respect to our common embrace of a lean and agile culture and that\\'s still my belief., Margin Levers,\\nCost Synergy, Pricing Capabilities, Brand Mix, Channel Mix, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, But we also approach some things differently and we\\'re excited to share our Conagra processes and tools, particularly those that drive innovation based growth such as demand science, precision marketing, and omni-channel selling. I\\'m proud of how our combined organization is working together in the short time since the completion of the deal. Shifting to our balance sheet, I\\'m very pleased with our disciplined focus on deleveraging in the last five months. We\\'re committed to a solid investment grade credit rating and as I said earlier, in a little less than five months since closing the transaction, we\\'ve already reduced debt by $685 million. We expect leverage ratios to improve over time as we increase our EBITDA growth from both the realization of cost synergies and the application of the Conagra Way to the Pinnacle portfolio. We will also continue to prioritize debt reduction in our approach to capital allocation., Conagra\\nProcesses, Innovation-Based Growth, Deleveraging, Credit Rating, Debt Reduction, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, I want to be clear that while we always view our portfolio with a lens toward optimizing growth and returns, we do not expect to need to make any additional divestitures in order to hit our leverage target. Looking ahead, you can be certain that we will not take our foot off the gas in the Legacy Conagra business and we\\'ve already mobilized to aggressively apply our playbook to the Pinnacle portfolio and we\\'ll continue to work to return those brands to growth. Finally, we remain squarely focused on executing our margin enhancing capabilities across the entire Company. As you probably glean from my remarks so far, we\\'ve got a great Investor Day coming up in a few weeks. As I mentioned earlier, we will be going into depth on the Conagra Way, how it has benefited Legacy Conagra and how it\\'s being applied to Pinnacle to build long-term sustainable growth. And while we\\'ve previewed a couple of the innovations we\\'ve been working on, there\\'s a full slate of new products on deck that we will show you., Growth, Returns,\\nDivestitures, Margin Enhancement, Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll also be sharing additional details on our Pinnacle action plan now that we\\'ve identified and begun to address the issues at hand. This will include a sneak peek of some new Pinnacle innovations that we\\'ll be bringing to market. And finally, we will be providing updates to our financial algorithm, including new data on cost synergies. We hope that you will be able to join us in Chicago on April 10th. We\\'re confident that the future here at Conagra is one of long-term profitable growth. Our Q3 progress contributes to that confidence as does the long-term opportunity we\\'ll share on April 10th., Growth,\\nProfitability, Innovation, Financial Algorithm, Long-term Opportunity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I\\'ll walk through the quarter and elements of both the Legacy Conagra and Pinnacle businesses. With approximately two months left in fiscal 2019 and the sale of the Wesson oil business now complete, I will also share our perspectives on the balance of the year. Slide 31 outlines our performance for the quarter. Net sales for the third quarter were up 35.7% compared to a year ago, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. Organic net sales, excluding the effect of the sale of Trenton, were up 1.9%. Organic net sales growth was largely in line with our expectations driven by the strong performance of our Legacy Conagra domestic retail segments, which when taken together exceeded 2.5% organic growth in the quarter. For the quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 30.5% to $781 million and adjusted gross margin declined 115 basis points to 28.9%., Growth, Sales,\\nPerformance, Organic Growth, Margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, While we continued to make good progress in driving Legacy Conagra realized productivity and price mix, Pinnacle\\'s gross margin of 26.2% in the quarter reduced total Company gross margin. In addition, the shift from A&P expense to above the line brand building investments with retailers reduced gross margin by approximately 100 basis points. I\\'ll walk through the adjusted gross margin bridge shortly. In line with that shift, total Company A&P expense decreased 13.9% to $67 million or 2.5% of net sales in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was up 23.4% compared to the prior year and was 10.1% of net sales. The increase was driven by the addition of Pinnacle expenses, partially offset by synergies and lower incentive compensation expense due to a lower stock price compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating profit increased 47.5% for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 16.3%, up 130 basis points compared to the year ago period exceeding expectations., Gross Margin, A&P\\nExpense, SG&A, Operating Profit, Margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted EBITDA increased 35.9% to $554 million from $408 million a year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.51 for the quarter, down 16.4% from the prior year. I will review the drivers of Q3 EPS performance in a moment. Slide 32 outlines the drivers of our net sales change versus the same period a year ago. Organic net sales growth ex Trenton of 1.9% reflects a 120 basis point increase in Legacy Conagra volume. Total price mix contributed 70 basis points as favorable price mix of 210 basis points was partially offset by increased brand building investments with retailers of 140 basis points. Total Conagra net sales grew 35.7% driven by a 34.3% net benefit from the acquisitions of Pinnacle and Sandwich Bros., the divestiture of the Canadian Del Monte business, and our exit of the foodservice business produced in the Trenton facility. FX negatively impacted net sales by 50 basis points versus the prior year., EBITDA, EPS, Net\\nSales, Price Mix, Acquisitions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 33 outlines our net sales performance by reporting segment. The Grocery & Snacks segment grew reported and organic net sales by 2.9% driven by continued excellent performance in the Legacy Conagra snacks business. Net sales of snacks increased 8.2% in the quarter led by strong end market performance by Orville Redenbacher, ACT II, Snack Pack, Slim Jim, and Duke\\'s. The Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued its momentum in the third quarter with reported net sales growth of 3.3% and organic net sales growth of 2.4%. The acquisition of Sandwich Bros., which closed in the third quarter last year, added 90 basis points to the net sales growth. Volume grew 3.5% behind strong growth across the frozen portfolio, including Marie Callender\\'s, Healthy Choice, Banquet, P.F. Chang\\'s, and Frontera., Grocery & Snacks,\\nRefrigerated & Frozen, Acquisition, Volume Growth, End Market Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The International segment\\'s organic net sales were down 90 basis points in the quarter as favorable price mix was more than offset by volume declines concentrated in certain global export markets that benefited favorably in the prior year quarter from hurricane related shipments. Foodservice organic net sales declined 60 basis points in the quarter as the segment continued to execute its value over volume strategy. These benefits can be seen in the strong Foodservice profitability metrics I will review shortly. Page 34 shows Q3 and implied Q4 net sales for Pinnacle versus a pro forma prior year number adjusted for Conagra\\'s fiscal calendar and accounting policies. For Q3, Pinnacle net sales reflects a mid-single digit percentage point decline versus the comparable year ago period on a pro forma basis. As expected, overall consumption declined during the quarter driven by Birds Eye, Wish-Bone, and Duncan Hines., International,\\nFoodservice, Net Sales, Volume, Consumption, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We also exited low ROI promotions. Additionally, the segment\\'s year-over-year performance was negatively impacted by this year\\'s later Easter holiday season. To help you better understand Pinnacles net sales on our fiscal calendar, we have included estimated Q4 Pinnacle net sales versus a pro forma prior year. We have also included additional pro forma sales detail in the appendix of today\\'s presentation. Moving to Slide 35, you can see that Legacy Conagra adjusted operating profit increased 10.3% and Legacy Conagra adjusted operating margin came in at 16.5% for the third quarter, significantly above year ago performance. Note the 326 basis point improvement in Foodservice adjusted operating margin for Q3 versus the prior year as the segment executes its value over volume strategy. The Pinnacle segment\\'s adjusted operating profit totaled $130 million., ROI, Promotions,\\nEaster Holiday, Operating Profit, Margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This performance was above expectations due to lower SG&A and approximately $12 million of synergies realized during the quarter, which were delivered ahead of schedule. The Pinnacle segment\\'s adjusted operating margin was 18.2% or 15.6% when including the $19 million of adjusted Pinnacle general corporate expenses that had been accounted for in the Company\\'s total corporate expenses and not in the Pinnacle reporting segment. Total Conagra adjusted operating profit was up 47.5% versus a year ago and adjusted operating margin was 16.3% for the third quarter, up 130 basis points. Slide 36 outlines the adjusted gross margin change for the quarter. As you can see, realized productivity and favorable price mix improved gross margin 260 basis points, more than offsetting inflation during the quarter and covering the increase in continued investments and brand building with retailers., SG&A, Synergies,\\nOperating Margin, Gross Margin, Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The gross margin of 26.2% on Pinnacle reduced overall Conagra gross margin 100 basis points versus the prior year. Slide 37 details Pinnacle\\'s adjusted profit margins by comparing performance this quarter to the most comparable Pinnacle Foods quarter a year ago from their earnings release, which was Pinnacle\\'s first quarter of calendar year 2018. Pinnacle\\'s Q3 adjusted gross margin declined 100 basis points versus this prior year comparison. Certain Pinnacle expenses were reclassified from cost of goods sold to SG&A to conform to Conagra\\'s accounting policies in the third quarter. Without this reclassification, Pinnacle\\'s Q3 gross margin would have been down approximately 200 basis points. Headwinds to gross margin came from inflation on crops, packaging and transportation, increased business investments, and unfavorable volume mix and absorption. These headwinds were partially offset by continued realized productivity in the Pinnacle business., Gross Margin,\\nPinnacle, Profit Margins, SG&A, Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As Sean mentioned, we are deploying the Conagra Way to improve Pinnacle gross margins moving forward and we\\'ll discuss this more at Investor Day. Pinnacle\\'s adjusted operating margin, which was not impacted by the accounting reclassification, was flat year-on-year. Operating margins benefited from SG&A favorability and $12 million in synergy capture. These tailwinds offset gross margin declines and an increase in transaction related amortization. Slide 38 outlines the drivers of our adjusted EPS performance for the quarter versus a year ago. The bridge shows Legacy Conagra EPS drivers followed by Pinnacle adjusted operating profit and the incremental capital costs associated with the acquisition. Starting on the left, Legacy Conagra EPS performance was driven by increased adjusted operating profit, which was offset by lower pension and post retirement net -- non-service income due to reduced asset return assumptions related to fully funding the pension plan last year., Gross Margins, SG&A,\\nSynergies, EPS, Acquisition, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, EPS was also reduced by lower adjusted equity method investment earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture as well as a higher Q3 adjusted effective tax rate of 24.3% versus 19.7% a year ago due to the prior year rate impact of passing tax reform. The impact of increased Pinnacle adjusted operating profit offset by higher incremental interest expense and share dilution from Pinnacle acquisition financing reduced EPS by approximately $0.08. Slide 39 summarizes select balance sheet and cash flow information. Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $745 million for the 39 weeks ended Q3, down versus the prior year. This decline was all realized in the first half as Q3 cash flow was up versus Q3 in the prior year. CapEx for the 39 weeks ended Q3 was $236 million or approximately 3.4% of net sales for the same period, in line with our expectations., EPS, Tax Reform,\\nCash Flow, CapEx, Acquisition Financing, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In the quarter, we paid a dividend at an annualized rate of $0.85 per share. Gross debt was $11.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, a reduction of $435 million versus the end of Q2. Net debt at the end of the third quarter was $10.8 billion and the net debt leverage ratio was approximately 4.9 times on the latest 12-months pro forma EBITDA, in line with our expectations. Since the end of the third quarter through today, we have paid off another $250 million in debt. At the end of the third quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately nine years; our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7%, and total fixed rate debt approximated 83%. As of today, our variable rate term loan balance has been reduced from $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter to $600 million. We remain committed to a solid investment grade credit rating and achieving our leverage ratio target of 3.5 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA by the end of fiscal \\'21., Dividend, Debt,\\nLeverage Ratio, Credit Rating, Maturity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As Sean noted, we do not expect that any additional divestitures will be required for us to achieve our target leverage ratio. We believe that any further divestitures could accelerate our timetable to achieve the target ratio. Slide 40 summarizes our updated fiscal year 2019 outlook for both the Legacy Pinnacle segment and total Conagra inclusive of the impact of Pinnacle from the closing date of October 26, 2018 to the end of the Conagra fiscal year on May 26, 2019. The updated organic net sales growth guidance removes Wesson for the entire fiscal year. All other metrics include Wesson\\'s actual results only for the time period the business was owned and now exclude expected results for the remainder of the fiscal year. We expect organic net sales growth ex Trenton to be approximately 1%. We expect Pinnacle reported net sales to be within the original net sales guidance range and we\\'ve now tightened that range to $1.71 billion to $1.73 billion., Leverage Ratio,\\nDivestitures, Fiscal Year 2019 Outlook, Net Sales Growth, Pinnacle, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our guidance on profit metrics is changing to reflect our ongoing real-time A&P optimization. We now expect adjusted gross margin for total Conagra to be below the previously provided range of 29.3% to 29.6%. Again, the primary drivers of this are the continued brand building investments with retailers along with increased cost of goods sold investments to support product and packaging innovation, and higher inflation on the Pinnacle business. Despite the lower gross margin, we expect adjusted operating margin to be above the range of 14.9% to 15.2% driven by more favorable SG&A expense as well as faster synergy capture. We are reaffirming our expectations for the effective tax rate and we now expect total Company net interest expense to be favorable and below the prior range of $390 million to $395 million as we have reduced debt ahead of our forecast. We have no change in our expected full-year share count., Gross Margin, SG&A Expense,\\nSynergy Capture, Effective Tax Rate, Net Interest Expense, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We are also reaffirming our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.03 to $2.08. We expect our improved operating margin and lower interest expense to offset the EPS impacts of the Wesson divestiture and lower-than-expected equity method investment earnings. Finally, we expect to exceed our prior synergy target of $20 million for fiscal 2019 and we are reaffirming our expectation for transaction-related amortization. As Sean mentioned, we will provide an update on synergies at Investor Day. Slide 41 provides a bit more detail on the organic net sales growth guidance. As I noted before, our prior guidance included Wesson for the full year. We are now excluding Wesson from our revised figure. By removing Wesson, our year-to-date organic sales growth increased by 20 basis points. Based on our performance through Q3, our guidance of approximately 1% organic net sales growth for the fiscal year excluding Wesson implies organic net sales growth of approximately 1.7% for the fourth quarter., EPS, Synergy Capture, Net Sales\\nGrowth, Divestiture, Interest Expense, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, That concludes my remarks. I will now pass it to the operator as Sean, Tom McGough, Darren Serrao, and I are ready to take your questions., Taking Questions, Operator, Ready,\\nConclusion, Remarks, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Fiscal 2019 is off to a good start, with performance in the first quarter largely in-line with our expectations. We sustained our solid top-line performance, delivering net sales growth in each of the four operating segments behind strong underlying fundamentals, and our operating margin came in slightly above our expectations despite a continued challenging inflationary environment. We continued to optimize our marketing investments to deliver a stronger ROI. Once again, this included shifting some low ROI investments from A&P marketing to above-the-line retailer investments. This shift enabled us to drive brand saliency, enhance distribution, and consumer trial in-store., Topic 1: Net Sales Growth, Topic 2:\\nOperating Margin, Topic 3: Inflationary Environment, Topic 4: Marketing Investments, Topic 5: ROI, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Given our solid start to the year, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 guidance for the stand-alone ConAgra Brands business. And as we announced earlier this month, subject to the completion of all conditions, our acquisition of Pinnacle Foods is expected to close by the end of October, ahead of our original schedule., Fiscal 2019 Guidance, Acquisition of\\nPinnacle Foods, Completion of Conditions, Stand-alone ConAgra Brands Business, End of October, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 5, our focus on brand-building and innovation is paying off, as we continue to bend the trend on the top line. Excluding sales from the Trenton, Missouri production facility, which we sold at the beginning of fiscal 2019, organic net sales increased 1.2% with all four operating segments delivering year-over-year growth in the quarter. Volume was essentially flat, with growth in our refrigerated and frozen, grocery and snacks, and international segments offset by expected volume declines in our foodservice segment, as we continued to implement our value-over-volume actions., Brand Building, Innovation, Organic Net\\nSales Growth, Volume Growth, Value-Over-Volume Actions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Overall, as demonstrated by our results, our deliberate actions to drive top-line growth have delivered consistent, steady improvement. And we\\'re particularly pleased with our momentum given our performance versus the competition. We are outperforming the industry in the categories in which we compete and we continue to gain share, more signs that our iconic brands are resonating with consumers and that our innovation is working., T1: Deliberate Actions, T2: Top-Line\\nGrowth, T3: Industry Performance, T4: Competition, T5: Brand Resonance and Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 7, our fundamentals remain strong. The growth in total sales is based on the strength of our brands, not on the back of deep discounts or promotions. Our base velocities remain strong and base dollar sales continue to grow, reflecting the higher quality portfolio that we have built over the last few years. The improved portfolio has earned increased distribution, reflected in the improved total points of distribution, or TPDs, on the right side of the page. As we continue to earn more TPDs, we expect to be able to build up upon our momentum and fuel continued top-line growth., T1: Strong Fundamentals, T2: Brand Growth,\\nT3: Distribution Gain, T4: Top-Line Growth, T5: Quality Portfolio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now, turning to Slide 8, as we\\'ve discussed in the past, we remain focused on supporting our brands with robust programs, including increased focus on high-quality retailer investments. By partnering with retail customers, we\\'re able to better drive brand saliency, distribution, and consumer trial versus continuing to invest in the tail of our A&P programs that historically carried a lower ROI. We will continue to evaluate the best marketing approach for each of our brands and products and remain nimble in terms of where and how we\\'re putting our marketing dollars to work., T1: Robust Programs, T2: Brand\\nSaliency, T3: Distribution Gain, T4: Consumer Trial, T5: Marketing Approach and Dollars Allocation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re focused on investing to engage the consumer with our brands, whether through traditional TV and print ads, distribution investments, merchandising, sampling, digital marketing, or customer loyalty programs. The objective is to drive both physical and mental availability and enhance brand affinity. What this does not mean is a return to deep price discounting and the scanner data is demonstrating that we\\'re serious., Investing, Consumer Engagement,\\nBrand Affinity, Physical Availability, Mental Availability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 9 provides more context on our approach. We make marketing investments based on their ability to increase physical and mental availability because our products need to be easy to find and quick to mind. I\\'ll touch first on physical availability. Ensuring our products are easy to find requires that we have great products and packaging design, but it\\'s more than that. As I mentioned earlier, we need our products placed where the consumers are and timed to be available when they want to buy them. We need to be in store and online, across channels and across stores, and this takes investment., Physical Availability, Mental\\nAvailability, Marketing Investments, Products and Packaging Design, Channel and Store Distribution, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also need our products to be quick to mind because it\\'s not just about showing up. More importantly, it\\'s about getting noticed. Clearly, we are doing a better job at that today than we had done historically. What\\'s behind that is a wholesale overhaul of how we drive mental availability. In the old days, it was done exclusively through A&P spend and almost all of that was in the form of traditional TV and print advertising. These days, the majority of our A&P marketing is in the form of highly efficient digital and social marketing. Further, we now have the analytical capability to be able to identify those A&P investments that are not working. When we find them, we eliminate those programs and redeploy the investments with retailers. These enhanced partnerships with retailers are helping our brands get noticed and be appreciated for the relevant innovative benefits they bring consumers., Mental Availability, Marketing\\nInvestments, Product Notice, Analytical Capability, Retailer Partnerships, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And for those of you trained to believe that above-the-line marketing spend is deep discounting, think again. Slide 10 clearly outlines that our average unit price change has been positive every quarter for more than two years. In addition, the percentage of products sold on promotion has decreased in all but one quarter over that same time period. We\\'ll stay true to our value-over-volume strategy and focus on making disciplined investments and building brand equity, not low-quality promotions., Value-Over-Volume Strategy,\\nDisciplined Investments, Brand Equity, Above-The-Line Marketing Spend, Promotion Percentage, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to our refrigerated and frozen segment on Slide 11, as you know, this has been a key area of focus for us in terms of improving our top line trend given the strong underlying category fundamentals and our untapped brand potential. We continued to drive organic net sales growth in the quarter, reflected in the quarterly sales chart on the left side of the page. Now, some of you may see the chart on the left and think growth is slowing. But take a look at the chart on the right. On a two-year basis, growth has been accelerating. We are now showing growth on top of growth., Refrigerated and Frozen Segment, Top\\nLine Trend, Organic Net Sales Growth, Quarterly Sales Chart, Two-Year Basis Acceleration, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can see on Slide 12, within the segment, the momentum in our frozen business continues to accelerate. Consumption growth remains very strong and we\\'re seeing this growth in the current quarter, and taking a look at the right-hand side of the page, on a two-year basis. And the good news is that we believe we still have a lot of room to grow in frozen. As our distribution performance continues to improve, we expect dollar sales growth to continue to follow suit. Going forward, we\\'re confident in our ability to further grow TPDs because of the exciting new innovation hitting the shelves during fiscal 2019., Frozen Business Momentum,\\nConsumption Growth, Distribution Performance, Dollar Sales Growth, New Innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, This fiscal year\\'s innovation slate is broader than fiscal 2018\\'s, as we are expanding frozen into new day parts with an eye on modern wellness and new cuisine offerings. We\\'re also introducing new handheld options. This slide includes some of our new innovations from Healthy Choice, Marie Callender\\'s, P.F. Chang\\'s, and Odom\\'s Tennessee Pride. These are delicious meals with on-trend flavors and modern attributes and consumers are responding positively., Innovation Slate, New Day Parts,\\nModern Wellness, New Cuisine Offerings, New Handheld Options, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The results of our efforts in frozen could not be more clear. Our single-serve meals are the fastest growing, both in terms of retail sales and total points of distribution. While we\\'re pleased with the progress in our frozen portfolio, we\\'re not resting on what we\\'ve accomplished to-date. We continue to see years of runway in frozen and expect the space to benefit from the long-term demographic tailwinds we spoke about at CAGNY. ConAgra is in a tremendous position to capitalize on this opportunity, especially with the pending acquisition of Pinnacle Foods and their strong portfolio of frozen brands., Frozen Sales Growth, Total Points of\\nDistribution, Demographic Tailwinds, Acquisition of Pinnacle Foods, Frozen Brands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to our grocery and snacks segment on Slide 15, while it\\'s still early days in our efforts to renovate brands in this segment and provide the appropriate support behind them, we are pleased to have returned to positive organic net sales growth on a year-over-year basis in the last two quarters, led by the snacks business. Recall that we combined Q2 and Q3 on this chart to remove some of the impact of last year\\'s hurricanes. The impact of the hurricanes is important to keep in mind as we lap those quarters this fiscal year., Grocery and Snacks Segment, Positive\\nOrganic Net Sales Growth, Renovated Brands, Appropriate Support, Hurricanes Impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Most of the discussion regarding this segment will be focused on the snacks and sweet treats businesses where we see tremendous opportunity. However, I would like to touch briefly on an example from our grocery portfolio because it demonstrates how we can stabilize iconic brands and renovate them to be fully competitive., Snacks Business, Tremendous\\nOpportunity, Grocery Portfolio, Iconic Brands, Renovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As those of you who are more familiar with our company know, some brands in our portfolio are what we describe as \"reliable contributors.\" These are not brands that we expect to deliver outsized growth but they are also not brands that we ignore or allow to atrophy. In fact, it\\'s quite the opposite. We surgically invest in these brands to ensure they will continue to generate stable, consistent cash flow to help drive growth., Reliable Contributors, Brand\\nInvestment, Stable Cash Flow, Growth, Consistency, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, One example of a reliable contributor is Chef Boyardee, highlighted on Slide 16. This summer, we launched Chef Boyardee throwback recipes, reminiscent of those dishes Chef Hector Boyardee actually cooked up back in the day, made with high-quality, simple ingredients. This is a premium product at a premium price and it\\'s margin accretive to the base Chef Boyardee offering. As you can see from the numbers here, when we innovate iconic brands, we are able to drive not just velocities but also brand saliency., Reliable Contributors, Chef\\nBoyardee, Throwback Recipes, Premium Product, Brand Saliency, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And as a nod to the nostalgic Chef jingle from yesteryear, we very efficiently created a music video to promote Chef Boyardee Throwback. This fun video is a mashup of the new and the old. It features Lil Yachty, a popular rapper, singer, and songwriter, with Donny Osmond. Amazingly, this song reached No. 3 on Spotify\\'s Most Viral playlist and there\\'s been a tremendous amount of user-generated content through Instagram and Snapchat. I encourage you all to find the music video on YouTube, but I\\'ll warn you that it may be stuck in your head for a while., Chef Boyardee Throwback, Music\\nVideo, Lil Yachty, Donny Osmond, User-Generated Content, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, This kind of high-efficiency renovation is key to keeping these brands reliably contributing. We will continue to bring modern attributes into our legacy iconic brands and use modern activation to market these brands with a purpose., Renovation, Efficiency, Legacy\\nBrands, Modern Attributes, Activation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now, turning to Slide 17, as a reminder, we have a nearly $2 billion snacks and sweet treats business and we see tremendous opportunity to grow it. Our portfolio in snacks is large but focused, and as we have shifted our efforts to manage these brands the way snack businesses are meant to be run, with a greater focus on speed, agility, and innovation, we\\'ve started to see the impact of our efforts. The snacking universe is performing well overall and our categories are growing. On top of that, we are gaining share. As you can see on Slide 18, our dollar sales growth has been significantly outpacing that of the categories over the last year., Tremendous Opportunity, Snacks\\nBusiness, Focused Portfolio, Innovation, Share Gain, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Consumption trends in snacks and sweet treats are also positive, as shown on Slide 19. Again, our two-year CAGR shows just how much we\\'ve delivered in recent years. Our two-year growth in snacks and sweet treats continues to accelerate and the great news is that we\\'re just getting started. At the upcoming National Association of Convenience Store Show, also known as NACS, in Las Vegas, we will debut our new approach to snacks and sweet treats to retailers. We look forward to sharing more information on new item innovations, our modern, relevant portfolio, and our approach to merchandising and brand support. We encourage you to attend the conference and stop by our booth to see our new approach firsthand., Consumption Trends, Snacks Business,\\nGrowth, New Approach, NACS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Slide 21 illustrates a few of the things we\\'re doing within snacks, starting with innovation and price/pack architecture. We are ramping up our core innovation capabilities as we recognize the need to be faster and introduce new varieties across our portfolio. We\\'re also focusing on optimizing our price/pack architecture with multiple product configurations. This is particularly important, not only in C stores where we already have a strong position, but also in other outlets, like drug and dollar., Innovation, Price/Pack Architecture,\\nCore Capabilities, Focus Areas, Multiple Product Configurations, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also taking a more innovative approach to shelving and displays. This means getting off the shelf, where some of our traditional grocery products play, and creating new points of interruption in-store in secondary and tertiary displays. These innovative display vehicles are intended to help keep our brands top-of-mind with consumers, drive impulse purchases, and accelerate our sales growth., Innovative Approach, Shelving,\\nDisplays, Top-of-Mind Consumers, Impulse Purchases, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And, finally, we\\'re taking a new approach to channel penetration. Historically, we have focused primarily on the traditional channels: grocery, C store, supercenter, club, and dollar. As a snacks business, we recognize the importance of having a ubiquitous presence, which means selling across the continuum, including QSR, on-premise, and eCommerce. The concept I discussed earlier, investing to drive both physical availability and mental availability, is critical in this business. Snacks are available everywhere and always within reach. That\\'s why it\\'s important for our brands to be in every channel in which consumers expect to see snacks., New Approach, Channel Penetration,\\nUbiquitous Presence, Mental Availability, Physical Availability, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, It\\'s also important for us to stay top-of-mind, the mental availability I mentioned. Some of our investments in new channel penetration, such as in coffee shops, won\\'t necessarily drive meaningful volume. But those investments are extremely meaningful in terms of getting in front of our consumers and positioning the brand. We\\'ve made progress on this front with several of our key snack brands. You\\'ll see brands such as Angie\\'s Boom Chicka Pop at coffee shops, Duke\\'s on airplanes, and David seeds at ballparks across the country. In addition, we\\'re continuing the focus on the eCommerce channel, which has also led to over 40% growth in ConAgra\\'s eCommerce sales for the last quarter., Top-of-Mind, Mental Availability,\\nNew Channel Penetration, eCommerce Sales, Focus Brands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, So, to wrap up, we will continue to roll out innovation to drive top-line momentum, we\\'ll continue to focus relentlessly on margin drivers to fuel growth, and we will remain disciplined in our strategic investments to drive brand saliency, distribution, and consumer trial., Innovation, Margin Drivers, Brand\\nSaliency, Disciplined Investments, Consumer Trial, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, During the second quarter, our year-over-year comparisons, particularly in the grocery and snacks and foodservice segments, will be challenged by the impact of last year\\'s hurricanes, which drove a 200 basis point increase in net sales growth in that period. However, this is just a timing issue in Q2 and Q3 and, again, we are reaffirming our full-year fiscal 2019 guidance. Despite the comparison headwind, we\\'re confident that our fundamentals remain strong and that we will continue to build upon the momentum we\\'ve developed through our innovation and brand-building efforts., Year-Over-Year Comparison,\\nHurricanes, Net Sales Growth, Full-Year Fiscal 2019 Guidance, Fundamentals, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Beyond that, we are well-positioned to accelerate the next wave of change with the addition of Pinnacle Foods. We look forward to executing our proven approach to innovation and brand-building to enhance their portfolio of leading brands., Innovation, Brand-Building,\\nPortfolio, Leading Brands, Proven Approach, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, With that, I\\'ll hand it over to Dave to share more on the financial details of the quarter., Financial Details, Quarter, Dave, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 26 outlines our performance for the quarter. As Sean mentioned, the quarter came in largely in-line with our expectations. Net sales for the first quarter were up 1.7% compared to a year ago and organic net sales, excluding the impact of the sale of our Trenton, Missouri facility, grew 1.2%, as all reporting segments delivered growth., Net Sales Growth, Organic Net Sales,\\nReporting Segments, Sale of Facility, Quarterly Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For the quarter, adjusted gross profit decreased 0.6% to $524 million and adjusted gross margin declined 65 basis points to 28.6%. In the quarter, A&P expense decreased to $43 million, or 2.3% of net sales, as we continued to shift low ROI A&P investments to higher ROI retailer investments that drive brand saliency, enhance distribution, and consumer trial in-store., Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted\\nGross Margin, A&P Expense, Brand Saliency, Distribution, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As planned, adjusted SG&A for the quarter was up 9.7% compared to the prior year and was 11.7% of net sales. The increase was primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense due to a higher share price at the end of the first quarter versus the first quarter a year ago, planned investments in IT projects, and a reduction in income from providing transition services on divestitures., Adjusted SG&A, Net Sales, Stock-\\nBased Compensation Expense, IT Projects, Transition Services, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted operating profit declined 3.5% for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, which was slightly above our guidance range. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.47 for the quarter, up 2.2% from the prior-year quarter and in line with our guidance., Adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted EPS,\\nquarterly performance, earnings guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 27 outlines the drivers of our net sales change versus the same period a year ago. During the quarter, organic net sales growth, ex-Trenton, was 1.2%, driven by a 1.2% increase in price/mix. You will see on the page that the increase in price/mix was 2.1% before the increase in retailer investment, which reduced price mix by approximately 90 basis points., net sales growth, organic net sales growth, price/mix, retailer investment,\\nquarterly performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our total net sales grew 1.7%, which translates to approximately $5 million in net sales, below the bottom end of our first quarter net sales guidance range. This can be explained by a larger shift from A&P to above-the-line retailer investment than we planned for in the quarter., total net sales, net sales growth, first quarter guidance, shift from A&P,\\nretailer investment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 28 outlines the puts and takes impacting our adjusted gross margin change for the quarter. As you can see in this chart, if we remove the impact of the shift in marketing from A&P to retailer investment, our adjusted gross margin would have been flat in the quarter versus a year ago. While inflation is at a slightly lower level than last year, it still approximates 2.5% for the quarter. Our supply chain and integrated margin management teams have done an excellent job pulling on all margin levers to help offset this inflation., adjusted gross margin, marketing shift, inflation, supply chain management,\\nintegrated margin management, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Slide 29, I will outline our performance by segment. I have just a few comments on this page. First, in the quarter, all four of our operating segments delivered organic net sales growth, ex-Trenton. Second, both the international and foodservice segments had strong quarters and are really seeing the benefits of their value-over-volume actions, most of which are largely behind them. And third, the international segment delivered a great quarter in the face of currency headwinds, primarily in the Mexican peso., segment performance, organic net sales growth, value-over-volume actions, currency\\nheadwinds, international segment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 30 outlines the drivers of our adjusted EPS improvement versus a year ago. Adjusted gross profit was neutral to EPS in the quarter. Adjusted gross profit, excluding the shift in marketing from A&P to retailer investment, improved $0.02. The impact of increased retailer investment reduced EPS $0.03. When combining the increase in retailer investment with the decrease in A&P investment, total marketing increased, reducing our EPS by $0.01 in the quarter., adjusted EPS, adjusted gross profit, marketing shift, retailer investment, A&P\\ninvestment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The increase in adjusted SG&A expense, which excludes A&P, decreased EPS by $0.03. The net impact of lower non-service pension and post-retirement income due to our de-risking strategy, along with lower equity earnings and higher interest expense, reduced EPS by $0.05., adjusted SG&A expense, non-service pension and post-retirement income, de-risking\\nstrategy, equity earnings, interest expense, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We continue to see the year-over-year benefit from tax reform, which added $0.05 to EPS. The first quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.5% was slightly higher than our Q1 estimate, due to changes in some state tax rate estimates which negatively impacted our first quarter EPS estimate by $0.01. Despite the higher Q1 tax rate, we are reaffirming our full-year tax rate estimate., tax reform, adjusted tax rate, state tax rate estimates, full-year tax rate\\nestimate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finally, while we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, last year\\'s repurchases caused our share count to be lower this quarter, which drove a $0.03 improvement in EPS., share repurchase, share count, EPS improvement, tax reform, de-risking strategy, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Slide 31 summarizes select balance sheet and cash flow information for the quarter. Net cash flow from operating activities for continuing operations was $95 million for the quarter, down from $142 million in last year\\'s Q1, primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and costs related to the Pinnacle acquisition. We had capital expenditures of $86 million, compared with $43 million in the prior-year period, due to the timing of planned business and infrastructure investments versus first quarter a year ago. In the quarter, we paid dividends of $83 million. We ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in total debt and approximately $75 million of cash on hand., net cash flow, operating activities, capital expenditures, dividends, total debt, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, On Slide 32, we reaffirm our stand-alone fiscal 2019 outlook, which does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Pinnacle, and includes the expected results for the Wesson Oils business as we continue to assess alternatives for this business. We expect net sales growth to be in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%. Excluding the impact of the Trenton facility sale, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of 1% to 2%., stand-alone fiscal 2019 outlook, Pinnacle acquisition, Wesson Oils business, net\\nsales growth, organic net sales growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect adjusted gross margin in the range of 29.7% to 30%. As we\\'ve been discussing, this metric is affected by our continued shifts of tail A&P investments to retailer investment. It is also affected by our expected inflation rate of 3% to 3.2%. We are experiencing inflation in packaging, transportation, other commodities, and some deflation in proteins and edible oils. Our estimate of packaging inflation includes some expected impact from tariffs., adjusted gross margin, tail A&P investments, retailer investment, inflation rate,\\npackaging inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 15% to 15.3% and we expect pension and post-retirement non-service income of approximately $40 million for fiscal year 2019.

While we typically don\\'t provide quarterly guidance given the normal business dynamics that can shift the timing of sales or expenses between months, we believe it is helpful to provide some guidance for the second quarter, as our net sales and margins will be impacted from lapping hurricanes Irma and Harvey that hit last year., Pinnacle announcement, quarterly guidance, net sales, margins, hurricanes Irma and\\nHarvey, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Consistent with our original fiscal 2019 plan, we expect organic net sales growth, ex-Trenton, to be flat to slightly down for the second quarter. Last year\\'s second quarter saw a net sales benefit of approximately $45 million driven by last year\\'s hurricanes that is not expected to repeat in this year\\'s second quarter. We expect the reported net sales growth rate to be approximately 40 basis points lower than the organic net sales growth rate, excluding Trenton. To be clear, this number does not include Pinnacle and only includes deals that have already closed., organic net sales growth, Trenton, reported net sales growth, Pinnacle,\\nhurricanes, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We do expect the Pinnacle acquisition to close by the end of October, which would result in approximately one month of Pinnacle\\'s results to be included in our fiscal 2019 second quarter results. We expect to disclose Pinnacle\\'s results as a separate reporting segment starting in our second quarter earnings release., Pinnacle acquisition, fiscal 2019 second quarter results, separate reporting\\nsegment, disclosure, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect Q2 adjusted operating margin in the range of 14.4% to 14.7%. Recall that in last year\\'s second quarter the incremental sales related to the hurricanes in the foodservice segment were sold at accretive margins and the segment is expected to post a more normal profit margin in Q2 of fiscal year \\'19. Finally, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $0.57 to $0.60., adjusted operating margin, hurricanes, profit margin, adjusted EPS, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Since we expect to close the Pinnacle transaction by the end of October, I\\'d like to remind you of our post-transaction capital allocation policy. First, we remain committed to a solid investment grade credit rating and our target leverage ratio is 3.5 times.

Also, we have approximately $720 million remaining on our capital loss carry-forward, which does not expire until the end of fiscal year 2021, allowing us to divest assets in a tax-efficient manner to support de-leveraging as appropriate., share repurchase program, Pinnacle deal, leverage targets, capital loss carry-\\nforward, de-leveraging, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2019, 1, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, That concludes my remarks. I will now pass it to the operator as Sean, Tom McGough, and I are ready to take your questions., remarks, operator, questions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for accommodating the date change and joining our conference call today to discuss our agreement to acquire Pinnacle Foods and our fiscal 2018 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings. We\\'ve got a lot to cover obviously. So, let\\'s go ahead and get started., agreement to acquire Pinnacle Foods, fiscal 2018 fourth-quarter and full-year\\nearnings, date change, conference call, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Over the past three years, we have made significant progress against our plan to transform ConAgra into a pure-play branded food company and establish a solid platform for future growth. We have built industry leading innovation capabilities, completely overhauled our culture and unlocked significant shareholder value. The impact of these efforts is evident in the tremendous Q4 that we announced today, having delivered 2% organic net sales growth and approximately 16% adjusted operating profit growth. Clearly, our hard work is paying off with improved and more consistent performance., transform ConAgra, pure-play branded food company, industry leading innovation\\ncapabilities, cultural overhaul, shareholder value, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, All of these actions have positioned us to take the next step in our evolution. Today\\'s announcement of our agreement to acquire Pinnacle Foods builds on the strong foundation we\\'ve established and serves as a catalyst to accelerate value creation for shareholders. It will enhance our scale by combining two growing portfolios of iconic brands and create a leader in frozen foods, while also expanding our presence in snacks. We are bringing together two highly complementary companies, with a strong combined balance sheet, positioning us to capture compelling financial benefits, including attractive synergies., agreement to acquire Pinnacle Foods, strong foundation, value creation for\\nshareholders, financial benefits, synergies, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Importantly, with a strong leadership team and proven capabilities driving brand building and innovation, we are confident in our ability to successfully integrate this acquisition and to build continued momentum and deliver meaningful shareholder value. Now, before I get into more detail about why we\\'re so excited about this acquisition, I do want to take a step back for a moment and talk about where we are in terms of executing our plan and how we positioned ConAgra to make this transaction a success. Three years ago this month, I hosted my first call as CEO of ConAgra. And during that call, I outlined my view that there was tremendous opportunity at the company, but that in order to unlock it, we needed to move quickly and take bold actions on a number of fronts and we did just that., strong leadership team, brand building and innovation, successful integration,\\nmeaningful shareholder value, bold actions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We exited private brands as well as non-core businesses like Spicetec and JM Swank, and we successfully executed the Lamb Weston spin. With these changes and many others, we transformed ConAgra into a new pure-play branded food company. At our inaugural Investor Day in 2016, we described the cadence of our work for our new company in a 5-year plan. Initially, our focus was to reset the top line by breaking ConAgra of its volume at any cost approach and to focus on our cost structure., private brands, non-core businesses, Lamb Weston spin, pure-play branded food\\ncompany, 5-year plan, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Recognizing that cost-cutting wasn\\'t enough, we outlined a plan to bend the top-line trend by building an innovation pipeline supported by new marketing programs and adding on-trend brands through modernizing acquisitions like Blake\\'s, Frontera, Thanasi Foods, Angie\\'s BOOMCHICKAPOP and Sandwich Bros. with a focus on driving profitable growth. Looking ahead to fiscal \\'19 and \\'20, we are focused on accelerating our growth and maintaining the strong momentum that has continued to build over the last three years. Meanwhile, margin expansion has become and will remain a way of life at ConAgra over the long term., innovation pipeline, new marketing programs, acquisitions, margin expansion, growth\\nmomentum, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we close fiscal 2018, we are delivering on the commitments we outlined at our Investor Day in 2016. We have made significant progress toward our goals of increasing margins, improving our top line and building a winning company. Now, moving to Slide 9, you can see that by aggressively attacking costs to rightsize our SG&A and driving realized productivity, we have been able to achieve strong margin improvement. Adjusted gross margin increased by 380 basis points since fiscal 2015 and adjusted operating margin increased by 460 basis points over the same three-year period., increasing margins, improving top line, building a winning company, aggressively\\nattacking costs, realized productivity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, But we knew we had to grow. So, we strengthened our foundation by pruning low-value SKUs, updating our innovation capabilities to modernize our iconic brands and investing behind on-trend brands consumers are demanding. We are also keenly focused on our differentiated capabilities in our value-over-volume strategy. Collectively, these efforts have enabled us to successfully bend the trend on the top line and we continue to gain traction., growing, foundation, innovation capabilities, value-over-volume strategy, top-line trend, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, This was our primary focus during fiscal 2018 and we are pleased with our momentum as underlying sales trends continue to strengthen and the quality of our revenue base continues to improve as reflected in increasing and higher quality total points of distribution. Base velocities also remain strong and base dollar sales continue to grow. It\\'s been hard work, but we have built a much healthier business and one that is less promotional with a greater percentage of volume coming from loyal households at a higher margin. By investing in renovation and innovation, we\\'ve improved the quality of our portfolio and positioned the business for sustainable growth., primary focus, momentum, underlying sales trends, base velocities, loyal households, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our aggressive efforts to modernize iconic brands and add new on-trend brands have been critical to driving results. Slide 12 shows a snapshot of our successful innovation efforts in fiscal 2018 with several more on the way in fiscal 2019 and we\\'re just getting started. And finally in order to build a truly winning company overall, we had to look inward at our culture and the way we operate. This resulted in a complete overhaul that has touched every area of the business., innovation efforts, successful innovation, on-trend brands, cultural overhaul, winning\\ncompany, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We right-sized the organizations and now have fewer layers and broader spans of control, resulting in a lean company with a focus on self-service. And across the board, we\\'ve made an effort to encourage a collaborative work environment, making ConAgra a better place to work and fostering a results-oriented culture of innovation and productivity. All of this has translated into very strong returns for our shareholders. Since the Board prepared to move in a new direction in August of 2014, total shareholder return is nearly 104%, almost doubling the return of the S&P 500., right-sizing, lean company, collaborative work environment, strong returns, total\\nshareholder return, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, So, that\\'s the backdrop to today\\'s exciting announcement. The bottom line here is that in the past three years, we have done heavy lifting in order to build a strong platform for future growth while also generating tremendous shareholder value. Importantly, it has positioned us to acquire Pinnacle Foods and accelerate our ability to generate value. By acquiring Pinnacle, we\\'re combining two portfolios with industry-leading growth to create an $11 billion company with iconic brands in frozen, snacking, refrigerated and grocery categories., heavy lifting, strong platform, shareholder value, acquiring Pinnacle, iconic brands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The new company will be a leader in frozen foods and will have enhanced scale overall to better partner with customers. In addition to our complementary portfolios, ConAgra and Pinnacle have similar results-oriented cultures. We believe Pinnacle will be an excellent cultural and operational fit. When coupled with our proven track record of executing strategic transactions, we will be able to implement a smooth integration process., new company, frozen foods, scale, cultural fit, integration process, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In addition to the strategic and cultural benefits, we expect attractive financial returns with an IRR above our WACC and EPS accretion in the first full fiscal year following close. Dave will take you through the details, but let me point out a few highlights of the transaction. Pinnacle\\'s shareholders will receive an implied value of $68 per share in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $10.9 billion. This transaction price represents a 15.8 times adjusted EBITDA multiple before synergies based on Pinnacle\\'s estimated fiscal year 2018 results and 12.1 times adjusted EBITDA, including run-rate cost synergies., strategic benefits, cultural benefits, financial returns, transaction details, multiple, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS in fiscal \\'20 with that accretion increasing as strong cost synergies phase in. As we have said many times before, we remain committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating with a focus on de-leveraging over the next few years. We expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar 2018, subject to Pinnacle\\'s shareholder approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Now, for those of you who may not be familiar with Pinnacle, the company\\'s full-year 2017 net sales were $3.1 billion, the majority of which came from its frozen and grocery segments., transaction accretion, credit rating, de-leveraging, regulatory approvals, Pinnacle\\nsales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Pinnacle\\'s portfolio of frozen, refrigerated and shelf-stable products includes iconic brands such as Birds Eye, Duncan Hines, Earth Balance and Udi\\'s, just to name a few. Like ConAgra, Pinnacle has been a leader in innovation and has delivered solid top-line results over time. Following the completion of the transaction, the new ConAgra Brands portfolio will be comprised of iconic brands with leading positions in strong categories. This will include $2 billion brands, Birds Eye and Marie Callender\\'s., Pinnacle portfolio, iconic brands, top-line results, new ConAgra Brands portfolio, $2\\nbillion brands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you see on Slide 19, this transaction will bring together two of the fastest growing portfolios in the industry based on domestic retail scanner data. For our most recent fiscal quarter, ConAgra Brands had the second highest year-over-year growth rate in the industry and Pinnacle was fourth. We believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to continue strong consumption trends with the expanded brand portfolio and broader in-store reach of the combined company. Slide 20 demonstrates how the acquisition will improve our overall scale as well as our position in frozen foods., fastest growing portfolios, industry growth rate, brand portfolio, broader in-store\\nreach, overall scale, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the scanner data, combined fiscal 2018 total retail sales were over $12 billion, making the company a top five industry player. Together, the combined company will be the No. 2 player in frozen foods with $4.9 billion in sales.

This transaction positions us to continue to build on our success and deliver even more great products for consumers. On Slide 21, you can see the complementary nature of our portfolios within our existing domains. Together, we will have a diverse, inherently hedged portfolio of leading iconic brands., large space, long-term tailwinds, transaction positions, complementary portfolios,\\ndiverse brands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We expect that the combined company will create new opportunities to partner with our customers. While I already touched on frozen, this transaction also enhances our portfolio of brands across other attractive domains, including snacks and sweet treats. As we\\'ve discussed before, this domain is an extremely compelling and exciting opportunity. You\\'ve already heard me speak about our efforts around culture at ConAgra, so I quickly want to highlight that we believe the cultures at ConAgra and Pinnacle are highly complementary and that our organizations are a natural fit., new opportunities, combined company, attractive domains, cultural fit, organization, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Much like ConAgra, Pinnacle shares our focus on innovation and on maintaining a lean and efficient operating structure and close ties with customers. This like-minded approach will be critical as we combine the two companies. So in summary, the strategic rationale is clear. We\\'re acquiring a portfolio of complementary, leading brands that strengthens our scale, enhances our position in the attractive frozen space and provides more opportunities for innovation. From a financial fit standpoint, the acquisition meets all of our criteria., Maintaining lean structure, close ties with customers, strategic rationale, financial\\nfit, opportunities for innovation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We look forward to continuing the top-line momentum at both companies and delivering meaningful cost synergies and IRR that exceeds our WACC and earnings accretion. At the same time, we will remain committed to a healthy capital structure, including a solid investment-grade rating. With our greater scale across leading iconic brands and an unwavering focus on driving innovation and profitable growth and a strong balance sheet and cash flow, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to drive long-term shareholder value.With that, I\\'ll hand the call over to Dave to share more financial details on the transaction and on our fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 results. Dave?, top-line momentum, cost synergies, IRR, capital structure, long-term shareholder value, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reiterating how excited we are about this transaction. I will start by sharing some additional details pertaining to the deal and we\\'ll then briefly discuss our strong fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2018 financial performance before we open it up for Q&A.Building on Sean\\'s comments, we are acquiring Pinnacle Foods in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $10.9 billion, including Pinnacle\\'s outstanding net debt of $2.7 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Pinnacle\\'s shareholders will receive $43.11 in cash and 0.6494 shares of ConAgra stock for each share they hold, equating to an implied price of $68 per Pinnacle share., transaction details, financial performance, deal valuation, shareholder value, Q&A, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle\\'s shareholders are expected to own approximately 16% of the combined company, assuming our issuance of incremental equity to the public to assist in funding the deal. This transaction price represents an adjusted EBITDA multiple of 15.8 times pre-synergies based on Pinnacle Foods\\' estimated fiscal-year 2018 results and 12.1 times adjusted EBITDA, including run-rate cost synergies. We secured a committed $9 billion bridge facility until permanent financing is raised. We expect to finance the $10.9 billion transaction by issuing $3 billion of ConAgra Brands\\' stock to Pinnacle\\'s shareholders and raising $7.9 billion of cash., transaction price, adjusted EBITDA multiple, financing options, shareholder ownership,\\ncost synergies, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The cash is expected to be raised through the issuance of $7.3 billion of transaction debt and the generation of $600 million of incremental cash proceeds from either a public equity offering and/or divestitures. We\\'ve assumed that we would issue the full $600 million in equity in calculating the deal metrics, but the ultimate mix of equity issuance and divestitures will depend on timing considerations, credit implications and market conditions. ConAgra Brands\\' pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio is expected to be approximately five times at closing. ConAgra is committed to a solid investment grade rating and has a targeted leverage ratio of three point five times as we prioritize de-leveraging., cash raising, transaction debt, equity issuance, divestitures, leverage ratio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We also expect to refinance all of Pinnacle\\'s debt in connection with the closing. Assuming an end of calendar year 2018 closing, we expect the transaction to be low single-digit accretive to adjusted EPS on a percentage basis in fiscal year 2020, the first full fiscal year following close, and to be high single-digit accretive to adjusted EPS on a percentage basis by fiscal year \\'22. We are expecting $215 million in run-rate cost synergies by the end of fiscal year \\'22, which represents approximately 7% of Pinnacle\\'s net sales. We estimate a cash cost to achieve those synergies of $355 million, split approximately 60% operating expense and 40% CAPEX., refinancing debt, adjusted EPS, cost synergies, cash costs, fiscal year 2020, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The synergies are expected to be driven by savings across procurement, logistics, manufacturing and SG&A. We expect to recognize approximately 60% of the synergies by the end of fiscal year \\'20, with the remainder phased in through fiscal \\'22. Our current estimate of incremental and tangible amortization from the deal is $55 million. As I previously mentioned, we are committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating and our target leverage ratio is three point five times., synergies,\\nprocurement, logistics, manufacturing, SG&A, incremental amortization, credit rating, leverage\\nratio, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect to maintain our annual dividend of $0.85 per share during fiscal \\'19 and in the future, we are targeting modest dividend increases as we prioritize de-leveraging. In late Q4 of fiscal \\'18, we suspended our share repurchase program. Going forward, we will only repurchase shares if we are tracking ahead of our leverage targets. Also, we have approximately $720 million remaining on our capital loss carry-forward, which does not expire until the end of fiscal year \\'21., dividend, share\\nrepurchase, leverage targets, capital loss carry-forward, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As a result, we can divest assets in a tax-efficient manner to support financing as appropriate. Now, I realize that you\\'ll have questions regarding the transaction announcement, but before we take your questions, let me quickly summarize our strong earnings results for the fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2018. As Sean mentioned earlier, we continued to execute against our transformation plan in fiscal 2018 and delivered strong fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2018 results. Net sales for the fourth quarter were up 5.6% compared to a year ago. Organic net sales grew 2% driven by solid growth in both of our domestic retail segments., divest assets,\\ntax efficient, earnings results, transformation plan, organic growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For the full year, net sales were up 1.4% and organic net sales decreased 0.2% in line with our estimates. For the fourth quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 6.1% to $573 million and adjusted gross margin improved 12 basis points to 29.2%. For the full year, adjusted gross profit decreased 0.5% and adjusted gross margin was 29.7%. In the quarter, A&P expense decreased to $59 million or 3% of net sales., net sales,\\norganic growth, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, A&P expense, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For the full year, A&P expense decreased to $279 million or 3.5% of net sales. Our decline in A&P expense was offset by increased retailer marketing investment to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution and consumer trial in store. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was up 3.4% and was 11.1% of net sales. For the full year, adjusted SG&A of $798 million was down slightly and was 10.1% of net sales., Marketing, Sales, Net Sales, Expenses, SG&A, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted operating profit was up 16.4% for the fourth-quarter and adjusted operating profit for the full year was up 3.5%. Importantly, adjusted operating margin continued its improvement versus the prior year. Fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 139 basis points from a year ago. Full-year adjusted operating margin was 16.1%, up 33 basis points versus the prior year and in line with our full-year guidance., Operating\\nProfit, Margin, Guidance, Full Year, Quarter, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.50 for the fourth quarter, up 35.1% from the prior year. And for the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.11, up 21.3%, above the high end of our guidance. Slide 30 outlines the drivers of our fourth-quarter and full-year net sales change versus a year ago. During the fourth quarter, organic net sales growth of 2% was consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter., EPS, Net\\nSales, Guidance, Organic Growth, Slide 30, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, For the full fiscal year, net sales grew 1.4% and organic net sales declined 0.2%, which was near the high-end of our full-year guidance range. Slide 31 outlines the puts and takes on our full-year adjusted gross margin decline. As we have been saying through the year, inflation has been coming in higher than we originally expected, finishing the year at 3.8%. Our integrated margin management team identified the margin levers to help offset that inflation and delivered strong results during the year., Net\\nSales, Organic Growth, Guidance, Adjusted Gross Margin, Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As you can see in this chart, if we remove the impact of the shift in marketing investments from A&P to retailer marketing, our adjusted gross margin would have been flat in fiscal year \\'18. Instead of going through the details of each segment this quarter, I will just call out a few big takeaways. First, in the fourth quarter, all four of our operating segments grew operating profit and expanded operating margin. Second, both domestic retail segments grew organic net sales in the quarter., Marketing, Operating Profit, Operating Margin, Growth, Segments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Next, our international segment expanded operating margin in each fiscal quarter this year. And finally, the Food service segment\\'s net sales growth rate has started to improve. The segment has now begun to lap its value-over-volume actions. Slide 33 summarizes our full-year segment results and how the improvements in adjusted operating profit and margin flow by segment., International, Food Service, Operating Margin, Segment Results, Slide 33, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, I will not discuss this in detail, but I do want to reinforce that the strong fourth-quarter performance across all segments gives us strong momentum heading into fiscal year \\'19.Slide 34 outlines the drivers of our 35% adjusted EPS improvement versus the fourth quarter a year ago. An increase in adjusted gross profit drove $0.06 of the EPS increase. Lower SG&A and A&P expense added $0.02 of improvement, which was offset by unfavorable interest expense and a slight decrease in the Ardent Mills joint venture income of $0.01. Tax reform and share repurchases added $0.03 of EPS improvement.Slide 35 outlines the drivers of our full-year adjusted EPS improvement of plus 21% versus a year ago., Momentum,\\nSegments, EPS Improvement, Drivers, Slide 34 and 35, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The slight decrease of $0.02 in adjusted gross profit for the year was more than offset by lower SG&A and A&P expense, which drove $0.10 of the EPS improvement. Another $0.10 of improvement came from increased Ardent Mills joint venture income and favorable interest expense. We saw a $0.06 favorable impact from tax and a $0.13 contribution from share repurchase activity. Slide 36 summarizes select balance sheet and cash flow information for the fiscal year., Adjusted\\nGross Profit, SG&A, A&P Expense, Tax, Share Repurchase Activity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Net cash flow from operating activities for continuing operations was $920 million for the year, down from $1.1 billion last year primarily driven by the $300 million pension plan contribution we made in the fourth quarter. We had capital expenditures of $252 million, up slightly versus the prior year. During 2018, we paid dividends of $342 million and repurchased approximately $967 million worth of stock. We ended the year with $3.8 billion in total debt and approximately $128 million of cash on hand., Net Cash\\nFlow, Operating Activities, Capital Expenditures, Dividends, Share Repurchase Activity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, In the first quarter of 2019, we are adopting a new accounting standard, which requires us to change how our income statement looks. We are now adding a new line item named pension and postretirement non-service income. The impact of this change is that we will reclassify $86 million of pension income out of adjusted operating profit and into this new line item below adjusted operating profit, reducing adjusted operating margin by 110 basis points. It is important to note that there is no impact to net income, only a shift between the line items., Pension\\nIncome, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Operating Margin, Net Income, Accounting Standard, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Today, we furnished an 8-K with historical financial information, so that people can better understand the changes on a historical basis and put our fiscal \\'19 guidance into the appropriate context. As we noted last quarter, now that our pension plan is more fully funded, we can reduce future volatility by changing the pension asset mix to a higher percentage of fixed income securities and a lower percentage of equity and other securities. The net impact of this change is a non-cash P&L headwind in fiscal year \\'19 as the new line item pension and postretirement non-service income will move from $86 million in fiscal \\'18 to approximately $40 million in fiscal \\'19. Note that this $46 million income reduction represents approximately $0.09 of negative EPS impact in fiscal \\'19.On Slide 39, we summarized our stand-alone fiscal 2019 outlook, which does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Pinnacle., Historical\\nFinancial Information, Pension Plan, Fiscal \\'19 Guidance, Non-Cash P&L Headwind, EPS Impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect net sales growth to be in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%. As we mentioned in this morning\\'s release, we recently sold our Trenton, Missouri production facility. As part of the transaction, the Foodservice segment exited a non-core co-manufacturing agreement that generated $79 million in net sales in fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of the Trenton facility sale, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of 1% to 2%., Net Sales\\nGrowth, Trenton Production Facility, Foodservice Segment, Organic Net Sales Growth, Non-Core Co-\\nManufacturing Agreement, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We expect adjusted operating margin, which reflects the impact of the pension reclassification I just discussed, in the range of 15% to 15.3% as we continue to strengthen our portfolio and invest in product innovation. We expect pension and postretirement non-service income of approximately $40 million for fiscal \\'19. We expect an effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 24%, consistent with what we guided to at CAGNY. We are not providing full-year EPS guidance given the dynamics of the pending acquisition of Pinnacle, including the yet-to-be-determined impact of our permanent financing to interest expense and shares outstanding., Adjusted\\nOperating Margin, Pension and Postretirement Non-Service Income, Effective Tax Rate, EPS Guidance,\\nPending Acquisition of Pinnacle, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Due to the timing of the Pinnacle announcement, we are, however, providing guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. For the quarter, we expect reported net sales growth in the range of 2% to 2.5%, adjusted operating margin in the range of 14.1% to 14.4%, which again is on the new basis to reflect the pension accounting reclassification, and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.46 to $0.49. We remain on track to deliver on our three-year stand-alone fiscal 2020 financial algorithm, which uses fiscal 2017 as the base year. As outlined on Slide 41, today, we are truing up our algorithm to reflect changes in pension accounting standards and our strategic decision to shift marketing investments from A&P to above the net sales line retailer marketing. We continue to expect an organic net sales compound annual growth rate to be in the range of 1% to 2%., Reported Net\\nSales Growth, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted EPS, Organic Net Sales Growth, Pension Accounting\\nStandards, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, While the strategic decision to shift from A&P marketing to retailer marketing provides a headwind to net sales growth, we expect an offsetting improvement in sales from those investments. Due to this marketing shift, adjusted gross margin is now expected to be approximately 30.5%. As a result of the new pension accounting reclassification, adjusted SG&A excluding A&P is now expected to be approximately 11.8%. Meanwhile, we expect A&P as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 3.2%, which is consistent with our deliberate choice to shift marketing investments from A&P to retailers., Adjusted Gross\\nMargin, Adjusted SG&A Excluding A&P, Pension Accounting Reclassification, Marketing Investments, A&P\\nas a Percentage of Net Sales, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 15.5%, reflecting the pension reclass.In summary, we continue to make excellent progress executing our strategic plan as evidenced by our strong fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2018 results. Although we will not update our long-term algorithm until after we close on the Pinnacle acquisition, you can expect to see a combined company that leverages the strengths of two winning organizations. We expect top line growth to continue at the pace both companies have delivered, but by combining two very strong portfolios, the sustainability of that growth is enhanced. And with the addition of Pinnacle, we expect an improved margin profile and EPS accretion versus the ConAgra base business., Adjusted\\nOperating Margin, Strategic Plan, Top-Line Growth, Sustainability of Growth, EPS Accretion, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 4, Dave Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As Sean mentioned, ConAgra has made tremendous progress over the last three years and we view the pending acquisition of Pinnacle as a catalyst to additional value creation for shareholders.That concludes my remarks. I will now pass it to the operator, as Sean, Tom McGough and I are ready to take your questions.\\xa0, Tremendous\\nProgress, Pending Acquisition of Pinnacle, Value Creation for Shareholders, Remarks Conclusion,\\nQuestion and Answer Session, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. We continue to make solid progress on our transformation plan during the quarter. Our primary focus this fiscal year has been on the top line and we are particularly pleased with our momentum on this front as underlying sales trends, notably consumption, continue to strengthen across our domestic retail segments.The investments we are making behind our brands to drive enhanced saliency, distribution, and consumer trial are having the intended impacts., Solid\\nProgress, Transformation Plan, Top-Line Momentum, Underlying Sales Trends, Investments Behind\\nBrands, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, These investments were largely above the line this quarter and consistent with our strategy to partner with retailers to acquaint our consumer base with our modernized brands and new innovation. The timing of these increased investments converged with greater-than-expected inflation in the quarter, including higher transportation costs, as well as higher-than-expected reductions in retail customer inventories. Combined, these factors created near-term pressure on our gross margin despite the fact that we continue to price ahead of our categories. Our M&A activity continued this quarter., Investments,\\nPartnership with Retailers, Modernized Brands, New Innovation, M&A Activity, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We were very disappointed in the Federal Trade Commission\\'s decision on the proposed Wesson sale and we are continuing to review Wesson\\'s role in the portfolio but we kept our M&A momentum nonetheless.Our solid performance has enabled us to raise our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range. As a reminder, the guidance we most recently provided at CAGNY already accounted for the impact of the tax law changes. Today\\'s incremental increase is based on our underlying performance. Even without the aid of tax reform, we would still exceed the high end of our original guidance range, driven by a strong top line., Disappointment\\nin FTC Decision, M&A Momentum, Full-Year Adjusted EPS Guidance, Underlying Performance, Tax Law\\nChanges, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you can imagine, this is very satisfying, particularly in a far more onerous inflationary environment than we planned for.At our inaugural Investor Day in the fall of 2016, we committed to do three things: increase margins, improve top line, and build a winning company. Strategically, our biggest priority this year has been strengthening top-line performance behind modernized brands and a strong innovation slate. After three quarters, we like what we see. Our focus on bending the trend on the top line continues to gain traction., Strengthening\\nTop-Line Performance, Modernized Brands, Innovation Slate, Priority Strategy, Traction Gained, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We expect to continue experiencing some variation in our results quarter to quarter but over time, we also expect to grow. As you will recall from last quarter, our shipments exceeded consumption largely behind the hurricanes. Of our 230-basis-point improvement in top-line growth in Q2, we estimated that approximately 220 basis points were related to the hurricanes. During our Q2 call, we shared that we expected a reversal of this dynamic in Q3 with consumption outpacing shipments, particularly in our higher-margin grocery and snacks segment., Expectation of\\nGrowth, Variation in Results, Hurricanes Impact, Consumption vs Shipments, Higher-Margin Segment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, That expectation played out.So taking a step back, combining Q2 and Q3 performance enables us to create a more normalized cohort that takes out the timing effect of the hurricanes and highlights the steady progress we are making to drive consumer takeaway.As you can see on Slide 9, we expect our strong top-line trend to continue in the fourth quarter. Our deliberate efforts to cut unprofitable SKUs and pull back on low-quality promotions are now largely behind us. In our largest segments, we\\'ve done a significant amount of the heavy value-over-volume lifting and the results are clear. As our new innovations have hit the marketplace, our top line has responded with consistent steady improvements., Strong Top-\\nLine Trend, Normalized Cohort, Efforts to Cut Unprofitable SKUs, Promotions, New Innovations, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, So while it remains early days, we are happy with our growth momentum and we are excited about the future. Our categories continue to grow largely driven by our efforts and you can see that we are growing share.Slide 11 highlights that the quality of our revenue base continues to improve. Total points of distribution are coming back in a much higher-quality fashion, base velocities have improved dramatically and base dollar sales are in positive territory again.As you can see on Slide 12, these trends have allowed us to continue to price above our categories. We\\'ve also remained true to value-over-volume strategy as the percent of products sold on promotions has decreased every quarter for more than two years., Growth\\nMomentum, Share Growth, Revenue Base Quality, Pricing Above Categories, Value-Over-Volume Strategy, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, While that trend is not sustainable in perpetuity, this clearly indicates that our strong volume performance was not driven by deep discounts or price rollbacks. None of these results would be possible had we not set out to aggressively modernize our iconic brands. It\\'s been heavy lifting but it\\'s also been tremendously rewarding and we are just getting warmed up with another robust innovation slate set to hit the market in fiscal 2019.As most of you know, we started our efforts to bend the top-line trend by focusing on frozen, given the strong underlying fundamentals of the category and the uncapped potential we identified in our brands. As you can see on Slide 14, our focus on innovation and targeted investments to drive brand saliency, distribution, and consumer trial are clearly bearing fruit., Modernizing\\nBrands, Top-Line Trend, Innovation Slate, Frozen Category, Brand Saliency, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve experienced continued growth in refrigerated and frozen, driven primarily by core business improvements and innovation launches in the Banquet, Healthy Choice, and Marie Callender\\'s businesses. Frozen retail sales have improved materially. Frozen consumption was up nicely again in the quarter continuing a strong trend in the domain.And we think we have a lot of room to go from here, as our distribution performance continues to improve and dollar sales growth has followed. Banquet, Healthy Choice, and Marie Callender\\'s are our three largest brands in frozen and received the most significant focus of our renovation work., Growth in\\nRefrigerated and Frozen, Core Business Improvements, Innovation Launches, Distribution Performance,\\nDollar Sales Growth, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, These brands play distinct roles in our portfolio and in the frozen category. Banquet is the No. 1 brand in frozen single-serve meals by volume, providing American classics to more than 40 million households. Healthy Choice competes very effectively and has had a makeover to focus on active lifestyle., Banquet,\\nHealthy Choice, Frozen Category, Brand Positioning, Makeover, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And Marie Callender is known for its comfort food. By focusing on and leveraging the unique characteristics and strengths of these brands, we\\'ve returned each of them to growth and reestablished the relevancy of frozen meals and we see substantial runway for continued growth ahead.As we showcased last month at CAGNY, we are very excited about our fiscal 2019 frozen innovation. We will extend into new dayparts, expand modern wellness and new cuisine offerings, and pursue hand-held options. A sampling of these new innovations can be found here on Slide 18., Frozen Brands,\\nGrowth, Innovation, Relevancy, Runway, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Taking a step back, one of the things we are most determined about in frozen is that, given our strong performance, we have ample room to capture our fair share of shelf space and grow organically.As highlighted in the chart on Slide 19, we have a much larger share of dollar sales than we have of TPDs. We are working with retailers to highlight this fact. As they review their planograms, we expect them to trim overskewed products, those that are shown above 100 in this index, and add more of the underskewed products, like ours, that have earned more space on the shelf. We expect this to be a tailwind for our frozen business going forward as we gain our fair share of distribution., Fair Share,\\nOrganic Growth, Shelf Space, Planograms, Distribution, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Progress we\\'ve made in frozen demonstrates that our plan is working and we are not resting on what we\\'ve accomplished to date.Turning to our grocery and snacks segment on Slide 20, as we noted earlier, we expected this segment\\'s sales to be down in Q3, given the impact of the hurricanes in Q2. Recall, we saw sales exceed consumption in the second quarter. However, in Q3, sales were down more than expected, primarily related to an unanticipated reduction in retail customer inventory levels near the end of the calendar year. While this adjustment in inventory levels negatively impacted the quarter, we expect this shift in customer behavior to be a one-time transitory occurrence.Despite the unexpected impact of the reduction in retail customer inventory levels in Q3, when you look at the normalized cohort of Q2 and Q3 combined, which removes the impact of these timing dynamics, we remain on track., Frozen\\nBusiness, Plan Working, Grocery and Snacks Segment, Hurricanes Impact, Retail Customer Inventory\\nLevels, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The improvement in the segment is encouraging and we have concrete plans in place to renovate certain brands and provide the appropriate investment support behind them similar to the work we\\'ve done in our frozen portfolio.Although it\\'s certainly early days, we are pleased with the underlying consumption trends in our grocery and snacks portfolio, which bodes well for this segment\\'s long-term top-line growth prospects. When you look just at our base business in grocery and snacks, trends are even more encouraging. Non-promoted consumption exceeded our internal expectations in the quarter and we\\'ve seen solid share performance as well. As you can see in the chart on the right, base dollar sales turned positive in the quarter for the first time in more than two years, a promising sign of what\\'s to come., Grocery and\\nSnacks Segment, Brand Renovation, Consumption Trends, Base Business, Share Performance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, A particular note, we are seeing growth from both iconic established brands like Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher\\'s, and Swiss Miss as well as newly acquired brands like Angie\\'s Boomchickapop, Duke\\'s, and Bigs. Again, these are encouraging signs and reflect the impact we can have as we bring the right approach to brand building and innovation across our portfolio.We expect to accelerate from here with a particular focus on snacking. We are energizing our snacking playbook with ramped-up innovation, a focus on driving impulse consumption, marketing with a purpose, and better price-pack architecture. We are creating a culture within a culture to fit the unique attributes of the snacks business, which has different products and purchasing behavior., Chef Boyardee,\\nOrville Redenbacher\\'s, Swiss Miss, Angie\\'s Boomchickapop, Duke\\'s, Bigs, Snacking Playbook,\\nInnovation, Impulse Consumption, Marketing with Purpose, Price-Pack Architecture, Unique Attributes\\nof Snacks Business, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, And as I mentioned earlier, it\\'s not just what we do with our snack brands, it\\'s how we do it. We need to be faster introducing new varieties across the portfolio like the exciting new innovation you see on Slide 25, which will hit the market in fiscal 2019.While we are excited about the opportunity in snacks, we remain focused on our grocery brands. Slide 25 also shows some of our upcoming innovation and renovation in the grocery business, where we see growth opportunities in condiments and enhancers and are working to keep our lucrative shelf-stable meals inside the business reliably contributing. We are renovating these brands with modern flavors, simplified ingredients, and new graphics to better appeal to today\\'s consumers., Fiscal 2019\\nInnovation, Snack Brands, Grocery Brands, Condiments and Enhancers, Modern Flavors, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Similar to what we\\'ve done in our frozen business, as we innovate, we expect to see benefits from improving sales mix, through premiumized products and more relevant brands.With all of our strong innovation hitting the market, we\\'ve made the strategic decision to add incremental support behind our brands to enhance saliency, distribution, and consumer trial. We recognize that today\\'s world requires a different approach to marketing. We are focused on making investments that engage the consumer with our brands and that could include traditional TV and print ads, distribution investments, merchandising, sampling, digital marketing, and even customer loyalty programs. As you can see on Slide 26, we are focused on reaching the consumer where they are on their path to purchase, including by leveraging targeted digital engagements and incentives prior to their arrival in the store.On Slide 27, you can see a sample of some of the brand investments we are making with our retail partners., Innovation,\\nSales Mix, Brand Enhancement, Marketing Strategy, Consumer Engagement, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, Some of our marketing investments may appear above the net sales line and some of it may be below, but the overall goal is to add incremental support, especially where we have new renovation and innovation. These investments will be brand- and customer-specific, as we acquaint consumers with our modernized portfolio and new innovation. And based on our strong consumer trends, these efforts are clearly paying off. As I noted at the outset, the timing of these investments converged with higher than anticipated inflation.As highlighted on Slide 28, inflation is trending well above the 2.7% we anticipated as part of our initial fiscal 2018 guidance., Marketing\\nInvestments, Consumer Trends, Brand Renovation, Customer-Specific Investments, Inflation Trend, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, The inflation impacts both input costs and transportation costs, which have risen sharply across the industry. The net result in Q3 was that despite our actions to price ahead of our categories, gross margins were pressured. As we\\'ve said before, margins may move around quarter to quarter beyond our normal seasonality and as we continue through our transformation, we will look to exit lower-margin businesses and enhance our portfolio with margin-accretive innovation and acquisitions quarter to quarter. We\\'ll also invest where we believe we can achieve a high ROI and, of course, we\\'ll see fluctuations in input costs., Inflation\\nImpact, Gross Margins, Category Performance, Investment Strategy, Input Costs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, However, we are confident that regardless of short-term impacts, we will continue to move the centerline of our profitability north over time as we have for the past several years. We are proud of the 430 basis points of margin expansion we achieved from fiscal 2015 to 2017 and we are not done.While there were a few transitory factors impacting our gross margin performance in Q3, overall, our operating margin remains strong and our fiscal \\'18 guidance shows that we continue to see operating margin expansion. Dave will provide a bit more detail on the specific factors that impacted near-term margin performance, but the bottom line is that none of these factors change our long-term margin outlook or our commitment to chip away at the margin opportunity over time.Turning to Slide 31, M&A remains a central part of our plan. We intend to pursue modernizing acquisitions, synergistic acquisitions, and select divestitures., Margin Expansion,\\nOperating Margin, Fiscal 2018 Guidance, M&A Strategy, Divestitures, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ll continue to strike the right balance between being aggressive and being disciplined. In the third quarter, we completed our acquisition of Sandwich Bros. and announced plans to divest our Canadian Del Monte fruit and vegetable business. We also announced the termination of our agreement to sell the Wesson oil business., Acquisition,\\nDivestiture, Discipline, Balance, Aggression, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, Sean Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer, As I mentioned earlier, we intend to continue to evaluate the role of this business within our portfolio.In summary, we are pleased with our continued progress on the top line and encouraged by the performance of our innovation. We intend to continue supporting growth through disciplined and strategic investments to drive brand saliency, distribution, and trial while we manage through a near-term inflationary environment. And we continue to be supported by a strong balance sheet with the financial flexibility to pursue M&A opportunities to enhance our portfolio. Given our solid performance, we\\'ve updated our fiscal 2018 guidance to raise adjusted EPS above the previously provided range which already accounted for the impact of tax reform.With that, I\\'ll hand it over to Dave to share more on the financial details of the quarter., Innovation, Growth,\\nInflation Management, M&A Strategy, Fiscal 2018 Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Slide 34 outlines our financial performance for the third quarter versus the prior year. I\\'ll walk through our results at the total company and segment levels and you are going to hear some themes.First, our investments to drive the top line are working., Financial\\nPerformance, Total Company Results, Segment Level, Investments, Themes, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, While the third-quarter organic net sales were negatively impacted by hurricane-related timing shifts between the second and third quarters as well as some unexpected customer inventory contractions in the third quarter, we see continued net sales progress. Our value-over-volume strategy and product innovation are working.Second, gross profit was impacted by several factors this quarter, including our intentional choices on how to invest in the top line. We continued to focus our brand building activity on above-the-line marketing investments with retailers and we\\'ve reduced A&P investments. This impacted gross margin.We also saw challenges on the cost side., Value-Over-\\nVolume Strategy, Product Innovation, Gross Profit Impact, Customer Inventory Contractions, Cost\\nChallenges, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our core productivity programs continue to deliver but their benefits were more than offset by significant input cost inflation in the quarter, including transportation. Since we don\\'t provide gross margin results at the segment level, you\\'ll see this flow through to operating margin in the segment performance.Also, the grocery and snacks segment experienced some transitory operating costs that impacted operating profit and margin. While the quarter presented a variety of dynamics to work through, the teams stayed focused on fundamentals and, as you can see, we\\'ve reconfirmed our net sales guidance and increased our EPS outlook for the year.So let\\'s dig into the details. Reported net sales for the third quarter were up 0.7% while organic net sales were down 2.2%, reflecting timing shifts in sales between the second and third quarters and overall customer inventories contracting more than anticipated around calendar year-end., Core Productivity\\nPrograms, Input Cost Inflation, Segment Performance, Transitory Operating Costs, Net Sales Guidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As Sean mentioned, total organic net sales for the second and third quarter combined grew 0.1%, showing continued positive momentum.Adjusted gross profit dollars were down $27 million, or 4.3%. Adjusted gross margin was 30% for the third quarter, in line with the second quarter and down approximately 155 basis points from the prior year. A&P expense decreased 13.7%, or $12 million. As seen in the second quarter, the decline in A&P was more than offset by increased above-the-line marketing investment with retailers to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial in store., Total Organic\\nNet Sales, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, A&P Expense, Brand Saliency, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, These retailer investments helped deliver strong consumption growth in the quarter.Adjusted SG&A was relatively flat to the prior year and was 10% of net sales, slightly favorable to the year-ago quarter as we continue to run a lean organization. We like that our adjusted SG&A spend as a percentage of net sales remains top-tier in the industry. Adjusted operating profit was down $12 million, or 3.6% for the quarter. This was due to inflation of 3.7%, driven primarily from input costs and transportation along with the retailer investments mentioned earlier., Retailer\\nInvestments, Consumption Growth, Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted Operating Profit, Input Costs and\\nTransportation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Although gross productivity was strong for the quarter, realized productivity was suppressed by higher-than-normal transitory operating costs. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61 for the third quarter, which was up 27.1%, driven primarily by lower tax rates.Slide 35 outlines the drivers of our third-quarter net sales change versus a year ago. Total company organic net sales were down 2.2%. Volume decreased 2.8%, driven mostly by the shift in timing of sales between the second and third quarters as well as a higher than expected reduction in retailer inventories near the calendar year-end, particularly in the grocery and snacks segment.Overall price mix increased primarily from favorable products and customer sales mix in foodservice along with positive pricing in the International segment and favorable price mix in the refrigerated and frozen segment from new products., Gross Productivity,\\nRealized Productivity, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Net Sales Change, Price Mix, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, This was partially offset by continued increases in above-the-line marketing investments. The acquisitions of the Duke\\'s and Bigs brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and Angie\\'s and Sandwich Bros. in fiscal year 2018 added 240 basis points to third-quarter net sales growth. The impact of favorable FX also contributed 50 basis points of reported net sales growth.Slide 36 outlines the adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating-margin declines in the third quarter., Above-the-Line\\nMarketing Investments, Acquisitions, Favorable FX, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Operating Margin, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Inflation in ingredients, packaging, and transportation were the major drivers of gross margin decline. Inflation of 3.7% in the quarter drove approximately $50 million of gross profit decline, negatively impacting gross margin by 2.5 percentage points. Transportation represented approximately 25% of total inflation for the quarter. Above-the-line marketing investments with retailers to drive enhanced distribution and consumer trial represented eight-tenths of a percentage point of the gross margin decline., Inflation, Gross\\nProfit, Gross Margin, Transportation, Above-the-Line Marketing Investments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Favorable price mix and strong gross productivity mitigated some of the gross-margin decline but realized productivity was suppressed due to transitory costs in our grocery and snacks business, which I will discuss shortly.Moving to adjusted operating margin, the 1.6-percentage-point decline in gross margin drove operating margins down for the quarter. This was partially offset by SG&A and A&P favorability as we continued to manage SG&A tightly and shift A&P investment to above-the-line marketing investment with retailers. We expect A&P to fluctuate quarter to quarter as we continue to evaluate the balance between below and above-the-line marketing opportunities.Slide 37 highlights our results by reporting segment. In our grocery and snacks segment, reported net sales of $838 million were down 1.3%., Gross Productivity,\\nGross Margin, Adjusted Operating Margin, A&P Investment, Grocery and Snacks Segment, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Acquisitions added 500 basis points of growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were down 6.3%. Consumption trends continued to improve in the quarter. However, organic volume declined 4% as we shipped below consumption in the third quarter after shipping above consumption in the second quarter., Acquisitions,\\nOrganic Net Sales, Consumption Trends, Volume Decline, Shipments, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Volume was also impacted by higher than expected retailer inventory reductions and deliberate actions to optimize distribution on certain low-margin items.Additionally, price mix declined approximately 2% as we increased above-the-line marketing investments with retailers. This investment is paying dividends as overall grocery and snacks consumption has improved driven by base velocity improvements, as Sean discussed. Adjusted operating profit of $178 million decreased 16% or $34 million, with adjusted operating margins down approximately 370 basis points versus the prior year. The segment\\'s operating margin compression was driven by four discrete items including some that were transitory in nature.First, input costs and transportation inflation were the largest headwinds on operating profit and margins in the quarter, representing $15 million of operating-profit decline., Volume, Price Mix,\\nAdjusted Operating Profit, Input Costs, Transportation Inflation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Second, we increased above-the-line marketing investments with retailers to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial of key brands. Consumption improved in both the second and third quarter supported by these investments. Third, despite strong gross productivity cost savings in supply chain, realized productivity in the quarter was reduced by certain transitory operational offsets. For example, we had unexpected plant maintenance and production downtime, higher-than-normal inventory writedowns on certain discontinued and slow-moving items, and unfavorable overhead absorption given the volume declines in the quarter., Above-the-Line\\nMarketing Investments, Consumption Trends, Gross Productivity, Transitory Offsets, Supply Chain, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Lastly, while the recent growth-focused acquisitions aided the segment\\'s operating profit growth rate, they also reduced the operating margin percentage. This is because these businesses have maintained strong A&P investments as well as elevated SG&A levels as they integrate into the company.In our refrigerated and frozen segment, reported net sales grew to $689 million, a 3.2% increase. Organic net sales grew 2.6% as the acquisition of Sandwich Bros. added 60 basis points of growth., Acquisitions,\\nOrganic Net Sales, Growth Rate, A&P Investments, SG&A Levels, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Volume increased 2% due to core business improvements and innovation launches in the Banquet, Healthy Choice, and Marie Callender\\'s businesses.Price mix increased 1% as mix improvements from recent innovation more than offset retailer investments to drive enhanced distribution and consumer trial. Adjusted operating profit of $127 million decreased 0.6% in the quarter. The benefits of net sales growth and realized productivity improvements were more than offset by increased input cost for proteins, packaging, and higher transportation cost.In our International segment, reported net sales were approximately $223 million for the quarter, up 8.9% versus the prior year. This reflects approximately 1% growth in volume and nearly 3% improvement in price mix as the international team continued to focus on value over volume., Volume, Price Mix,\\nAdjusted Operating Profit, Input Costs, Transportation Costs, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, FX favorably impacted net sales in the third quarter by roughly 5%. International adjusted operating profit was $30 million, up 67% or $12 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by increased pricing and lower A&P spending.In our foodservice segment, net sales were approximately $244 million for the quarter, down 6% versus the prior year. We also continued to implement our value-over-volume strategy in foodservice. Volume decreased approximately 13% in the quarter as the foodservice team exited non-core and low-performing businesses., Volume, Pricing, A&P\\nSpending, Foodservice Strategy, FX Impact, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Price mix increased 7% driven by favorable product and customer mix as well as pricing. Foodservice adjusted operating profit was $24 million, down 13.4% versus the prior year with operating margins decreasing 85 basis points. Favorable price mix was more than offset by the impact of volume declines and increased material and transportation cost.Adjusted corporate expenses were $38 million for the quarter, down 27.4% reflecting a decrease in certain IT projects and incentive costs, slightly offset by a reduction in income from two terminated transition service agreements.Moving to Slide 38, this chart outlines the drivers of the 27.1% adjusted diluted EPS improvement in the third quarter versus a year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars decreased $27 million in the third quarter, driving $0.04 of the EPS decline., Price Mix,\\nFoodservice Adjusted Operating Profit, Material and Transportation Costs, IT Projects, Income from\\nTerminated Transition Service Agreements, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Lower SG&A and A&P expense added $0.02 of the EPS improvement with some of the A&P investment moving above the line as discussed. Favorable interest expense and an increase in Ardent Mills joint venture income added $0.01 of EPS improvement. EPS was favorably impacted by $0.09 as the adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19.7% versus 31.4% a year ago. The lower tax rate in the third quarter reflects the favorable impact of tax reform., Lower SG&A and A&P\\nExpense, Favorable Interest Expense, Increase in Ardent Mills Joint Venture Income, Adjusted\\nEffective Tax Rate, Tax Reform, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Our estimated full-year adjusted tax rate is 29% to 30%. Share repurchases added $0.04 of EPS improvement as we continued our repurchase activity in line with our outlook.Slide 39 summarizes selected balance sheet and cash flow information for the quarter. Net cash flow from operating activities was $808 million for the year-to-date period, up from $804 million for the same period a year ago. We had capital expenditures of $176 million through the year-to-date period, up from $159 million in the comparable-year period., Tax Rate, Share\\nRepurchases, Net Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We repurchased approximately 8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $280 million in the third quarter. Total year-to-date share repurchases were $860 million. We ended the third quarter with net debt of approximately $3.5 billion, up from $2.7 billion at fiscal year-end 2017. This increase supported our share repurchases and acquisitions., Share Repurchases,\\nNet Debt, Acquisitions, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, As we have stated previously, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating for the business.As shown on Slide 40, we made a voluntary $300 million pension contribution on the first day of the fourth quarter. It was funded with a one-year term loan at a rate of three month LIBOR plus 75 basis points. Given the timing of this contribution, we deducted this payment on our fiscal 2017 tax return at the old rate, reducing cash taxes by approximately $105 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. Please note that this does not impact our adjusted book tax rate that runs through the P&L.The rating agencies view underfunded pensions largely as debt., Pension\\nContribution, Credit Rating, Tax Impact, Cash Taxes, Adjusted Book Tax Rate, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We share this view since the net obligation is recorded as a liability on our balance sheet. By funding this contribution with debt, the transaction is effectively debt-neutral. This contribution will reduce our variable PBGC premium paid by the Pension Plan Trust, which is calculated based on the plan\\'s underfunded status. Currently, the PBGC charges pension plans as a variable expense of just over 3% on underfunded pension obligations., Pension\\nContribution, Net Obligation, Variable PBGC Premium, Underfunded Status, Debt-Neutral, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Moving our pension plan toward fully funded status allows us to reduce future volatility, as we can now better match our asset returns with the liability payments. We will give more color on the P&L impact of these actions when we share our fiscal 2019 guidance next quarter. At that time, we will also provide additional information on the impact of the change in accounting that requires all pension costs and benefits other than service cost to be presented outside of operating profit.Slide 41 outlines our updated guidance for fiscal year 2018 and reflects a few changes since our CAGNY presentation. We expect organic net sales growth to remain near the high end of our range, which was previously communicated at minus 2% to flat., Moving Pension\\nPlan, Fiscal 2019 Guidance, Accounting Change, Organic Net Sales Growth, Slide 41, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Reported net sales growth is expected to be 150 basis points higher than the organic net sales growth rate due to acquisitions and FX. This has been updated from our previously communicated range of 100 to 150 basis points higher. We expect adjusted operating margin to be near the low end of our range of 15.9% to 16.3%.We continue to expect inflation to be 3.7% for the full year, but it is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter as we start lapping the input cost inflation we experienced in the fourth quarter a year ago. We continue to expect our full-year fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate to be in the 29% to 30%, range reflecting the lower federal tax rate.In addition to our pension investment that I just discussed, we continue to review investment opportunities associated with our estimated reduction in cash taxes in line with our balanced capital-allocation approach and we\\'ll provide more details when we provide fiscal 2019 guidance in our fourth-quarter earnings release.We expect adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2.03 to $2.05, up from the range of $1.95 to $2.02 provided at CAGNY., Organic Net Sales\\nGrowth, Adjusted Operating Margin, Inflation, Adjusted Tax Rate, Balanced Capital Allocation, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We remain on track to repurchase approximately $1.1 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2018 subject to market and other conditions, including the absence of any synergistic acquisitions.Regarding steel and aluminum tariffs, we expect no impact to fiscal 2018 given our inventory position. We are still evaluating the estimated impact to fiscal 2019 and are working through our mitigation plans up and down the value chain. Our trade group and other advocacy partners are also working on options.In summary, ConAgra Brands is making strong progress. We continue to see consumption trends momentum and have made great progress upgrading our volume base., Share Repurchase,\\nTariffs, Inventory Position, Trade Group Advocacy, Momentum Consumption Trends, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, We are investing in our businesses despite increased inflation in transitory costs. We\\'ve made several modernizing acquisitions over the last year and our balance sheet remains strong, giving us flexibility to pursue additional acquisitions to drive shareowner value. We are reconfirming our full-year organic net sales guidance near the high end of the range and have raised our adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal year 2018.Thank you. This concludes my remarks., Investing in\\nBusiness, Acquisitions, Balance Sheet Flexibility, Organic Net Sales Guidance, Adjusted EPS\\nGuidance, Conagra Brands\\nCAG, 2018, 3, David Marberger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sean, Tom McGough, and I will be happy to take your questions. I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session., Sean, Tom McGough,\\nQ&A Session, Operator, Conagra Brands\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Greg Tierney, Vice President of SP&A and Investor Relations, Thank you, Charlie, and hello, everyone. Following prepared remarks today from Gavin and Tracey, we will take your questions.

I\\'m going to change things up a bit here from our normal structure, and I\\'m going to share seven key headlines from our third quarter. Firstly, Coors Light is growing share of the total beer category in the United States. This is our biggest brand in our biggest market, a brand that many doubters could get back onto this trajectory, and it\\'s growing share in the industry for the first time in more than five years. Two, globally, Molson Coors\\' net sales revenue from its above premium portfolio has surpassed 25% of our brand volume net sales revenue on a trailing 12-month basis for the first time since the revitalization plan was announced. Third, Molson Coors\\' grown share of the U.S. above premium segment for two straight quarters for the first time in over five years., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Revitalization Plan, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, Four, as we expand beyond beer and with three months still left in the year, Molson Coors has sold nearly two million cases of non-alcohol beverages in the United States; five, Molson Coors\\' total market share trend in Canada has improved for eight straight months, leading to national share growth in the third quarter, and the European business has bounced back, essentially reaching 2019 revenue levels; sixth, challenges in the global supply chain impacted our third quarter volumes. We are already seeing improvements in brewery output in October., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, We are back to shipping approximately one million barrels per week in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. And in aggregate, distributor inventories are starting to improve; and seventh, like for so many others, transportation availability and transportation costs are worse than they have been in years. So I want to start there and then we\\'ll work backwards. Like we\\'ve discussed for the second quarter and like other CPG companies, inflation was again a challenge in Q3, specifically with respect to transportation., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, Fuel prices are up, truckers are in short supply around the world and freight costs are up 2%. As Tracey highlighted in our second quarter earnings, we have long-term contracts with carriers and a robust hedging program as well as meaningful cost savings programs to mitigate price fluctuations. The driver shortages at our existing carriers are forcing us to use the spot market and to pay spot market rates, which are significantly higher than they have been in many years., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, Right now, up to one in every four shipments are at these high spot rates. That level of inflation cannot be completely absorbed or avoided, and you\\'re seeing the results in our COGS for the quarter. Beyond the hedging and cost savings, we are taking steps to reduce the impact, including shipping more beverages on rail. Also, we expect gross margin benefits as we continue to premiumize our portfolio under our revitalization plan and achieve improved efficiencies through our economy SKU deprioritization and rationalization plans., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, But even with those steps, inflation will continue to be a pressure point for us and for just about every other company. Our shipment trends in the third quarter were not what we wanted them to be. Some of that is related to the challenges of moving finished goods to distributors and also moving suppliers within our brewery network. Some of that is related to our own suppliers having difficulty in getting us the materials we needed since they\\'re facing the same supply chain challenges as everyone else in the world. But the good news is that this trend, as I\\'ve said, has already started turning., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, While August and September were difficult production months, the steps we have taken in the third quarter to expand our base of material suppliers and improve our availability for most packaging materials have allowed us to increase shipments so far in the fourth quarter. We are once again shipping approximately one million barrels per week in the U.S., and that has helped us increase distributor inventories by approximately 20% over the past few weeks. So that is, of course, the measurement of our total network and that is a trend we expect to build on., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, I also want to quickly address volume. Some of you may look at our North American volume trends with concern. But I want to remind you that this is predominantly the result of an intentional and strategic decision we made to deprioritize and eliminate a number of large -- a large number of lower-margin, slower moving SKUs in the U.S. that were mainly in the economy segment. The intention was to simplify and premiumize our portfolio, and that is exactly what is happening. So our volume is down, but our net sales revenue per hectoliter is up., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, And I can again tell you that we are on track to deliver on our full year key financial guidance for 2021. This is what is happening in Canada. We have improved our national share trend for eight straight months, leading to total share growth in the third quarter. This is the best share trend performance we have seen in at least six years. As the on-premise reopens in Canada, our share is growing above 2019 levels, a big driver of our progress. Coors\\' growing share of the segment in Canada as well with Miller Lite also growing approximately 30% in the quarter., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, Molson Ultra has seen strong year-to-date performance with volume growing mid-single digits along with strong share gains. These are all very good signs for our business in Canada. Not to be outdone, our European business has bounced back strongly. In the U.K., our on-trade net sales revenue has now reached 2019 levels, and margin has surpassed 2019 levels as the business continues to premiumize, which I\\'ll touch on in more detail in a moment., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, As we look to the fourth quarter, we plan to keep this momentum up by stepping up our European marketing investments. two years after shifting from a beer company to a beverage company, we have reached a significant milestone. For the first nine months of the year, we have sold nearly two million cases of non-alcohol beverages as we continue to drive toward our $1 billion revenue ambition for our emerging growth business by 2023. We have launched into categories where we think we can create scale offerings like water, energy and coffee., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, First, of course, is our partnership with Zoa, which has been making some serious noise since its launch just over six months ago. It\\'s the number one new energy franchise in 2021, and it\\'s already a top 20 energy drink brand. Zoa already has 31,000 buying outlets and over 115,000 points of distribution with more coming online every day. There\\'s a lot of upside for this brand. We have the distribution partnership for La Colombe\\'s incredible lineup of ready-to-drink coffee, one of the fastest-growing spaces in the beverage industry., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, And thanks to our early success with distribution in large national retailers, we\\'ve also unlocked national distribution of La Colombe in grocery and mass channel stores for early 2022. Growing beyond the beer aisle is no longer an aspiration. We\\'re doing it, and we\\'re driving scale. Molson Coors\\' grown share of the U.S. above premium segment for two straight quarters for the first time in over five years. That mark is largely driven by the continued success of our U.S. hard seltzer portfolio, and this is another space I want to take a little more time to discuss., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, There\\'s been a lot of noise over the past few months about hard seltzers in the U.S., a lot. Not all of it has been accurate, and much of it has been unproductive. Now hard seltzer is going to keep growing at 200% per year. But of course, not. And we\\'ve been clear since last fall that we didn\\'t expect them to do so. But in spite of the rosy forecast some had a year ago and the bleak forecast being thrown about today, there are some clear truths. Hard seltzers are here to stay., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, There are over 10% of beer category sales and growing. But the segment has matured and the easy growth is over. Moving forward, it is going to take distinctive, differentiated brands in order to succeed, and that\\'s why we feel so confident about our portfolio. While so many of the mainstays are declining, Molson Coors has the fastest-growing hard seltzer portfolio in the United States. Vizzy brand volumes grew 50% in the third quarter versus the prior year and passed yet another competitor to become the number four hard seltzer in the United States., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, Despite only being launched in 16 different markets in the U.S., Topo Chico Hard Seltzer occupies the number three slot as a new item in the general malt beverages category. The brand also garnered a 2.4% share of the U.S. market according to IRI, and this success has led to the national expansion of the brand. But that is not the extent of our premiumization. Our joint venture with Yuengling launched in Texas this quarter, and we are very pleased with the very early results., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, By the end of August, it was already available for purchase in 40,000 locations across the state. As the on-premise continues to strengthen, so have two of our biggest above premium brands. Peroni is up double digits, gaining share in the category and outpacing all other European imports. Blue Moon Belgian White is up high single digits. And this quarter, we announced plans to build upon the success of Blue Moon LightSky, which our data shows is 96% incremental to the flagship Belgian White., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, Blue Moon LightSky continues to see double-digit growth year-to-date after finishing 2020 as the number one new beer in the United States. In 2022, we\\'ll add more muscle to the Blue Moon family as we launched LightSky Tropical Wheat. As I said in our second quarter earnings call, premiumization is here to stay at Molson Coors. All that growth in the U.S. is contributing to a significant premiumization of our entire global portfolio., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, So much so that as of the third quarter, the percentage of Molson Coors portfolio that is above premium has surpassed 25% of our brand volume net sales revenue on a trailing 12-month basis for the first time since the revitalization plan was announced. And that progress is being seen throughout the company. The early returns on our Canadian Hard Seltzer portfolio have exceeded expectations with both Vizzy and Coors sales are generating strong market share., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, We will extend that streak when we introduced Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in Canada in 2022, which we announced this month. Six Pints, our Canadian craft business, is growing double digits despite on-premise restrictions. Combined with the growth of Miller Lite and Molson Ultra, this has continued to drive the premiumization of our business in Canada. In Western Europe, our new Mediterranean lager, Madre, has already doubled its distribution goal for the year, now at approximately 5,500 on-premise outlets with more coming in the fourth quarter., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, In Central and Eastern Europe, New Smooth pilsner lager Pravha, has been performing above expectations across the market with presence in more than 15,000 outlets supported with strong media campaigns, reaching over 13 million consumers. And in Latin America, Coors Light is growing in Puerto Rico for the first time in 15 years, where it sells at an above premium price point. And speaking of Coors Light, that brings me to the final point I want to make this morning. In the face of many doubters, Coors Light is growing share of industry in the United States for the first time in more than five years., Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, The brand\\'s strong performance in the third quarter was aided by the continued success of our Made to Chill campaign and through increased marketing investment. We\\'re actually making progress on the things that are within our control and driving measurable results that continue us on the path to delivering on our goal of sustainable, long-term top and bottom line growth. We are two years into our revitalization plan, and I remain confident that we are on track to deliver our full year key financial guidance for 2021, while continuing to invest behind our brands., Financial Results, Marketing Investment, Sustainability, Long-term Growth, Revitalization Plan, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, And I\\'m very optimistic about the future for Molson Coors. Tracey?, Financial Results, Growth, Share, Industry, Supply Chain, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. As Gavin mentioned, we are again reaffirming our key financial annual guidance for 2021. We continue to make real progress executing our revitalization plan. We invested behind our business, driving premiumization of our portfolio of our brands and strengthening our core business while continuing to delever our balance sheet and to reinstate the dividend., Financial Results, Revitalization Plan, Investment, Premiumization, Balance Sheet, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, But like most consumer product companies, we face supply chain challenges and inflationary cost headwinds in the quarter, which had an impact on our quarterly results. Now let me take you through our quarterly results in more detail and provide an update on our outlook. Consolidated net sales revenue increased 1% in constant currency, delivering over 99% of third quarter 2019 level despite the on-premise continuing to operate below pre-pandemic levels., Financial Results, Supply Chain, Inflationary Costs, Outlook, Consolidated Net Sales Revenue, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Consolidated financial volumes declined 3.9%, primarily due to lower brand volumes, which were down 3.6%, largely due to the economy segment, including the economy SKU deprioritization program. Top line performance benefited from strong global net pricing, favorable brand mix levels in North America as we continue to premiumize our portfolio, double-digit revenue growth in Europe and positive channel mix. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.6% in constant currency, driven by the strong pricing growth, coupled with positive brand and channel mix., Financial Volumes, Brand Volumes, Global Net Pricing, Channel Mix, Net Sales Per Hectoliter, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 8.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation, including higher transportation and input costs, mix impact from premiumization and volume deleverage. However, with our robust hedging and cost savings programs, we have been able to mitigate some of the inflationary pressure. Underlying MG&A in the quarter increased 3.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher marketing investment behind our core brands and innovation as well as parking targeted reductions to marketing spend in the prior year period due to the pandemic, which was largely offset by lower G&A expenses., Financial Results, Cost Inflation, Premiumization, Robust Hedging, Cost Savings Programs, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As planned, we increased marketing investments in the quarter to levels above second quarter 2021 and third quarter 2019 levels, ensuring strong commercial pressure behind our key innovations and core brands. As a result of these factors, underlying EBITDA decreased 10.9% on a constant currency basis. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was significantly impacted by a discrete tax item. You may recall in the second quarter of last year following the issuance of certain U.S. tax regulations, we recognized a material discrete tax expense of $135 million., Financial Results, Marketing Investments, Underlying EBITDA, Effective Tax Rate, Discrete Tax Item, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, It was related to previously taken tax positions over several years. In the third quarter of this year, we reached a settlement with the tax authorities with regard to our tax positions impacted by those tax regulations. As a result of the settlement, we had a release of unrecognized tax benefit positions in the quarter that resulted in a P&L tax benefit of $68 million, including a $49 million discrete tax benefit in the third quarter. Underlying free cash flow was $933 million for the first nine months of the year, a decrease in cash received of $227 million, from the prior year period., Financial Results, Tax Positions, Settlement, P&L Tax Benefit, Underlying Free Cash Flow, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, This decrease was primarily driven by the repayment of taxes related to various government-sponsored deferral programs related to the pandemic. As a reminder, in 2020, working capital was positively impacted by over $200 million for benefits related to these government tax deferral program. Capital expenditures paid was $363 million for the first nine months of the year as we continue to invest behind capability programs such as our previously announced Golden Brewery modernization project and our new Montreal brewery expected to open by year-end., Financial Results, Tax Deferral Programs, Working Capital, Capital Expenditures, Investment, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Capital expenditure levels were relatively consistent with the comparable period in the prior year. Now let\\'s look at our results of our business units. In North America, the on-premise has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, but continued to improve on a sequential quarter basis. In the third quarter, the on-premise channel accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales revenue in the quarter, compared to approximately 12% in the second quarter of 2021 and 16% in the same period in 2019., Capital Expenditure Levels, Business Units, On-Premise Channel, Net Sales Revenue, Sequential\\nQuarter Basis, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In the U.S., the on-premise accounted for about 88% of 2019 net sales revenue in the quarter. In Canada, restrictions continue to ease throughout the quarter with the on-premise net sales rising to 80% of 2019 levels in the third quarter, up from about 25% in the second quarter. North America net sales revenue was down 2.1% in constant currency as net pricing growth and positive brand mix were more than offset by lower volume. North America financial volumes decreased 4.8%, largely due to lower brand volumes of 3.8%, driven by the U.S., On-Premise, Net Sales Revenue, Financial Volumes, Brand Volumes, Constant Currency, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In the U.S. domestic shipment volumes decreased 6.6%, trailing brand volume declines of 5.2%, driven by unfavorable shipment timing and declines in the deprioritized economy segment. Economy was down double digits as we deprioritize and announced the rationalization of approximately 100 non-core SKUs, which were primarily in the economy segment. Conversely, our U.S. above premium portfolio was up high single digits., Domestic Shipment Volumes, Brand Volume Declines, Unfavorable Shipment Timing, Deprioritized\\nEconomy Segment, Above Premium Portfolio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Canada brand volumes improved 0.5% in the quarter, and Latin America brand volumes continued their strong performance and experienced 9% growth, reflecting the easing of on-premise restrictions. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 2.4% in constant currency with net pricing growth and favorable brand mix, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix given the growing license volume in Latin America. U.S. net sales per hectoliter increased 3.2%, driven by net pricing growth and positive brand mix, led by best premium innovation brands, including Vizzy, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and Zoa., Brand Volumes, Net Sales Per Hectoliter, Constant Currency, Geographic Mix, Best Premium Innovation\\nBrands, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis grew in Canada due to positive brand and channel mix as well as net pricing increases while Latin America also increased due to favorable sales mix. Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 7.3%, driven by inflation, including higher transportation and packaging materials and brewery costs, volume deleverage and mix impact from premiumization., Net Sales Per Hectoliter, Brand Volume Basis, Positive Brand Mix, Channel Mix, Underlying Cost Per\\nHectoliter, Inflation, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Underlying MG&A decreased 1% as higher marketing investments were offset by lower G&A due to lower incentive compensation expense and the recognition of the Yuengling Company joint venture equity income. We increased marketing investments behind our innovation brands and our iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, including an increase in local tactical spend as on-premise restrictions eased throughout the quarter., Underlying MG&A, Marketing Investments, G&A Expense, Incentive Compensation Expense, Yuengling\\nCompany Joint Venture Equity Income, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As planned, we increased U.S. marketing investment compared to not only the same period in 2020, but also versus 2019. North America underlying EBITDA decreased 14.3% in constant currency. Europe net sales revenue was up 14.7% in constant currency, with an 11% increase in net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis driven by positive brand, channel, geographic and packaging mix and positive net pricing. Top line performance also benefited from the on-premise reopening in the U.K. on July 19., Underlying EBITDA, North America, Europe, Net Sales Per Hectoliter, On-Premise Reopening, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, And of note, in the third quarter of 2020, the on-premise have fewer restrictions than in the second and fourth quarters of that year. The U.K. on-premise channel net sales revenue reached similar levels of pre-pandemic levels in the quarter. Europe financial volumes decreased 2% and brand volumes decreased 3%. The decline was primarily due to lower Central and Eastern European volumes driven by increased on-premise restrictions related to the coronavirus and the disposal of our India business in the first quarter of 2021., On-Premise Restrictions, U.K. On-Premise Channel Net Sales Revenue, Europe Financial Volumes, Brand\\nVolumes, Disposal Of India Business, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, This was partially offset by growth in the above premium brand volumes, which reached another record high portion of our Europe portfolio. Underlying EBITDA increased 2.7% in constant currency as revenue growth was partially offset by higher marketing investments. Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, we had lowered our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to 3.3 times and reduced our net debt to $6.6 billion, down from 3.5 times and $7.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020., Brand Volumes, Underlying EBITDA, Net Debt, Balance Sheet, Marketing Investments, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, On July 15, we announced that we had repaid in full the $1 billion, 2.1 senior notes that are maturing that day using a combination of commercial paper and cash on hand. We ended the third quarter with strong borrowing capacity with approximately $1.5 billion available capacity under our U.S. credit facility. Now turning to our financial outlook. We are again reaffirming our 2021 key financial annual guidance originally provided on February 11, 2021., Repaid In Full, Commercial Paper, Cash On Hand, Borrowing Capacity, U.S. Credit Facility, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, While we are sitting in a better place than we were a year ago, it bears reminding that uncertainty pertains to the coronavirus and its variants remains severely decreased by market. If restrictions are reinstated in some of our larger markets, this could have a significant impact on our financial performance over the next few months. Now I\\'ll provide some underlying expectations to provide some additional context for the balance of the year., Uncertainty, Coronavirus, Variants, Market Restrictions, Financial Performance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth for the full year on a constant currency basis. We continue to work to build inventories with wholesalers, which have been at low levels. And as Gavin mentioned, we are making progress. In the U.S., we expect on-premise trends to continue to improve as we lack restrictions in the prior year period. In Canada, we continue to see greater on-premise reopenings bearing by COVID, which should continue to provide positive channel mix., Mid-Single-Digit Net Sales Revenue Growth, Building Inventories, On-Premise Trends, U.S.\\nRestrictions, Canada On-Premise Reopenings, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In Europe, the U.K. top line should strongly benefit from the prior year fourth quarter, given the on-premise was fully locked down for November and December of 2020, which are typically strong months given the holidays. Our guidance also anticipates continued strength in our both premium portfolio, particularly hard seltzers, innovations and imports., On-Premise Restrictions, U.K. Top Line, Both Premium Portfolio, Hard Seltzers, Innovations, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Also, we expect continued solid progress against our previously discussed emerging gross revenue goal of $1 billion in annual revenue by 2023, against which we continue to track ahead of plan driven by Zoa, La Colombe and Latin America. We continue to anticipate underlying EBITDA to be roughly flat compared to 2020 as top line growth is expected to be offset by continued cost inflationary headwinds largely transportation and packaging materials, including aluminum and the Midwest premium and increased marketing investments to deliver against our revitalization plan., Emerging Gross Revenue Goal, Annual Revenue By 2023, Underlying EBITDA, Cost Inflationary\\nHeadwinds, Marketing Investments, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Under the revitalization plan, 2021 has been a year of investment for the company, and we intend to continue to increase marketing investments to build on the strength of our core brands and support successful innovation. As Gavin mentioned, we expect fourth quarter marketing investment to be higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, as we continue to ramp up supply and put commercial pressure to support our big bet brands in both North America and Europe., Revitalization Plan, Marketing Investments, Core Brands, Fourth Quarter Marketings Investments, Big\\nBet Brands, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We continue to anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $800 million, and net interest expense of $270 million, plus or minus 5%. However, due solely to the discrete tax benefit in the third quarter, we have adjusted our effective tax rate range for 2021 only to 13% to 15% from 20% to 23% previously. Also, as a reminder, in 2020, our working capital benefited from the deferral of approximately $130 million in tax payments from various government-sponsored payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic., Anticipated Depreciation and Amortization, Net Interest Expense, Effective Tax Rate Range, Working\\nCapital, Discrete Tax Benefit, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We currently anticipate the majority to be paid this year as they become due. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to prioritize investing in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. First, we plan to continue to prudently invest in brewery modernization and production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives, improve efficiencies and advance toward our sustainability goals., Major Topics: Capital Allocation, Investing in Business, Debt Reduction, Returning Cash to\\nShareholders, Brewery Modernization, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Second, we have a strong desire to maintain and, in time, upgrade our investment grade rating. As such, we expect to continue to improve our net debt position and reaffirm our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3.25 times by the end of 2021, and below three times by the end of 2022. And third, on July 15, our Board of Directors determined to reinstate a quarterly dividend on our Class A and Class B common shares and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share payable on September 17., Major Topics: Net Debt Position, Investment Grade Rating, Quarterly Dividend, Board of Directors,\\nClass A and Class B Common Shares, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, The Board made the decision to reinstate the dividend at a level that they believe is sustainable and provides room for future increases as business performance improved. In closing, to be sure we have faced challenges in the quarter, but are proud of our agility and the actions we have taken to manage through them. Through it all, we have continued to successfully execute against our revitalization plan with clear premiumization of our portfolio., Major Topics: Dividend, Business Performance, Revitalization Plan, Premiumization of Portfolio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, And despite all the ups and downs throughout this year, we have reaffirmed our key financial annual guidance yet again. Like most consumer product companies, we face near-term challenges, but the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we are confident we are on the right path toward long-term sustainable revenue and underlying EBITDA growth., Financial guidance, fundamentals, challenges, long-term growth, sustainability, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, So with that, we look forward to taking your questions.

Good morning, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Nearly two years ago, we laid out the Molson Coors revitalization plan, a multiyear strategy to deliver the sustainable top line growth that has eluded our business for many years, while at the same time, delivering sustainable bottom line growth. Under the plan, we have streamlined the company on reinvesting those savings to build on the strength of our iconic core, aggressively grow our above premium portfolio, expand beyond the beer aisle, enhance our capabilities and support our people and communities. We had a few doubters then and we had some unexpected challenges since, from a global pandemic to severe Texas winter storms to a cyberattack in our company. But nearly two years later, we can say to those doubters with confidence that Molson Coors is on the path to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth. Our performance this quarter speaks for itself. I say that because for nearly two years, we\\'ve talked a lot about the outputs of our revitalization plan, new investments, new partnerships, new product launches and new campaigns. But today, we\\'re able to start talking meaningfully the outcomes from the revitalization plan, and that\\'s an important shift. In the second quarter, despite ongoing pandemic restrictions, we delivered the most top line growth of any quarter in over a decade, and we nearly achieved 2019 net sales revenue levels on a constant currency basis despite those pandemic restrictions during this quarter., Financial guidance, sustainable growth, iconic core, above premium portfolio, capabilities, people and communities, outputs, outcomes, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President And Chief Executive Officer, I\\'m incredibly pleased with this progress, but it\\'s a strong indicator of what is yet to come through our revitalization plan. Our progress was primarily driven by three things. First, it was driven by the fact that we delivered the best brand mix in the United States since the inception of the MillerCoors joint venture in 2008. This significant premiumization of our portfolio was led by the strong growth of our U.S. hard seltzers, where we doubled our share of the U.S. hard seltzer segment in the second quarter. We took over as the global brewer with the fastest-growing U.S. seltzer portfolio. And we recently passed another major brewer and are fourth in total U.S. seltzer shares, we continue to move toward our goal of achieving a 10 share in the U.S. by year-end. Those are outcomes. We\\'re also continuing to see strong traction with our Vizzy innovation. Vizzy\\'s fast-turning new lemonade variety pack helped the Vizzy brand gain almost a full point of U.S. share in the second quarter. And we just added another new package to that family with Vizzy Watermelon, which has been a hit with retailers thus far. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer continues to exceed our expectations in the 16 markets in which it\\'s sold in the U.S. The demand has far outpaced our original plans for the brand, and with supply improving, we are now positioned to be more aggressive in marketing this brand. That is an outcome. Outside of the U.S., our Canadian hard seltzer portfolio continues to perform very well. The combination of Vizzy and Coors Hard Seltzer has earned more than a 50 share of the hard seltzer category with the largest beer retailer in the country., Financial guidance, brand mix, premiumization, U.S. hard seltzers, Vizzy innovation, Topo\\nChico Hard Seltzer, Canadian hard seltzer portfolio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, And with that, we look forward to taking your questions.

And thank you all for joining us today. Let me start by stating the obvious, the first quarter was not the quarter we expected to have, that reality was driven by 3 events, cyber security incident that caused the global system outage, a freak winter storm in Texas, that forced utility companies to shutoff power to major businesses, including our Fort Worth brewery and government pandemic restrictions that shut down the entire on-premise channel in the UK and severely restricted much of the on-premise in Canada., 1. Cyber security incident, 2. Freak winter storm, 3. Government pandemic restrictions, 4. On-\\npremise channel, 5. Brewery, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, To say that all of these events happened in a single quarter is unprecedented, would be an understatement. So while we can\\'t control the weather, across the business, we executed well on what was in our control. That\\'s true, how we responded to each event. Our team quickly implemented contingency plans to boost production and get our core brands back to a stable inventory before Memorial Day. Right now, we are shipping, over 1 million barrels a week in the United States for the first time in nearly a year. But most importantly, it\\'s true of how we are executing on our revitalization plan., 1. Events, 2. Contingency plans, 3. Production, 4. Inventory, 5. Revitalization plan, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, During the first quarter, Coors Light and Miller Lite outperformed the combination of Bud Light and Michelob Ultra in U.S. industry share performance versus the prior year according to IRR. Our U.S. above premium portfolio grew brand volumes versus the prior year and continue to gain industry share according to IRR, and we took substantial steps toward our hard seltzer ambition. Our Truss joint venture\\'s non-alcoholic cannabis beverages are holding strong as the number 1 dollar share spots in the entire Canadian cannabis beverage market. As expected, the availability of our 12-ounce standard cans returned to normal levels. And we continued working to protect the environment through significant initiatives in the United Kingdom. So let\\'s look deeper in each area., 1. Coors Light, 2. Miller Lite, 3. Bud Light, 4. Michelob Ultra, 5. Hard seltzer, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let\\'s start with our Coor. We will continue to see improving brand volume trends for Coors Light and Miller Lite in North America over the past quarter, dovetailing off strong performance in 2020. But the performance is even more impressive when you look at our biggest brand and our biggest family of brand. Coors Light finished the quarter with its strongest category share performance since Q1 of 2017. And Coors Banquet posted its best quarterly volume performance in over 4 years in the United States. We\\'re building on that strong performance in the Coors family of brands with the launch of Coors Pure in March, our first USDA certified organic beer brand. And we had a strong Q1 in Panama, with over a 50% increase in brand volumes with Coors Light\\'s explosive triple-digit growth leading the way., Coors Light, Miller Lite, Coors Banquet, USDA certified organic beer, Panama, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now, when it comes to our plans to aggressively grow our above-premium portfolio, as you know, we have big ambitions for hard seltzers is this year and the first quarter was a big one. And as we sit here today, our share of U.S. hard seltzer segment is over 50% higher than it was at the beginning of the year. In a single week, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer jumped to 3.2 share U.S. hard seltzer category, despite only launching in 16 markets. And it achieved a 20 share in Texas. Now I know it\\'s early days, but there is a stunning effect, which speaks to the opportunity with this brand. And it\\'s not alone in our portfolio, Vizzy was IRR top 10 U.S. industry growth brand in Q1. We are building on that with the brand\\'s second variety pack, which launched in March and the new Vizzy Lemonade which launched several weeks later. They are both performing well. And in fact, Vizzy Lemonade is the second fastest turning hard lemonade seltzer in the market., Hard seltzer, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, Vizzy, Texas, U.S. industry growth brand, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, We made significant headway with our hard seltzers in Canada and in Europe as well. Of just over a month in market, Vizzy and Coors seltzers are top hard seltzer brands with some of the leading Canadian retailers. In the UK, our new Three Fold hard seltzer brand is launched. While our new brand Wai in Central and Eastern Europe is launching in the coming weeks., Hard seltzers, Vizzy, Coors seltzers, Three Fold, Wai, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, In above premium beers, Blue Moon Light Sky, the number 1 new item in U.S. beer last year is currently the number 1 share gainer in U.S. craft beer in 2021. And Hop Valley has made its official national debut in the U.S. and Canada. So our first national light here in the U.S., we believe it will be another driver of growth for our above premium portfolio., Blue Moon Light Sky, Hop Valley, U.S. craft beer, national debut, above premium portfolio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, When it comes to our plans to expand beyond beer, last year we made a lot of news as we took on a number of partnerships to build a competitive portfolio. This year, it\\'s all about executing on those plans. Though it gives us a strong entry into the $16 billion U.S. energy and performance space and is positioned to take a meaningful share of the category within a matter of months, it\\'s just now beginning to hit shelf. For Bar Memorial Day we expect we will have over 80,000 points of distribution. And by the end of summer, that number is expected to climb to nearly 150,000.,  beer,  energy and performance space,  partnerships,  distribution,  Bar Memorial\\nDay, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, La Colombe gives us the number 1 above premium player in the RTD coffee space and I\\'m excited to report that we are ahead of plan on all of our distribution targets. Truss Canada, a Canadian cannabis joint venture with HEXO is holding strong as the number 1 dollar share position with 6 of the top 10 cannabis beverage skews in Canada. And our Truss U.S.A joint venture is building on that through their first lineup of hemp-derived CBD beverages in Colorado. And we have entered the fast-growing RTD cocktails space through an exclusive equity and distribution agreement with Superbird in above premium tequila-based Paloma. This entire lineup represents tremendous growth for our business and is helping us drive our emerging growth division toward a $1 billion revenue business by 2023., La Colombe, RTD coffee space, Truss Canada, cannabis beverage skews, Truss U.S.A, hemp-derived CBD\\nbeverages, Superbird, RTD cocktails space, emerging growth division, revenue business, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, Last but certainly not least, is how we are investing in our capabilities, our people and our communities. We have long been recognized as a leader for our environmental efforts, and several weeks ago, we became the first major UK brewer to operate entirely by renewable energy. Soon, everyone of the 1 billion pints of beer we produced annually in the UK will be made with 100% renewable energy. And we didn\\'t stop there. We are removing plastic rings from all of our major cracks across the UK., Environmental efforts, renewable energy, plastic rings, community investment, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the U.S. this month, we announced our investment in TRU Colors, a North Carolina-based brewery that was founded on the premise that aligning rival gang members under the same roof with a common goal to both mitigate street violence and create economic opportunity. We\\'re excited to share our knowledge on growing brand positioning and supplier relationships. And we are excited to be part of the business that is driving positive change and creating economic opportunity., Investment, TRU Colors, brewery, street violence, economic opportunity, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Gavin Hattersely, President and Chief Executive Officer, I can assure you the events of this quarter are not lost on any of us, but as the quarter came to a close, there is land on the horizon. The on-prem gradually begin to open back up in the UK. Our industry standard can inventory normalized and our weekly shipments in the U.S., topped 1 million barrels for the first time in nearly a year. We are making progress on the things that are within our control and we are delivering against our revitalization plan. And that is what gives me the confidence to reaffirm our guidance for the full year. That is what gives me confidence in the current expectation that the Board will be in a position to reinstate the dividend in the second half of this year. That is what gives me confidence that we\\'ll achieve long-term top line growth. And that is what tells me the future of Molson Coors is bright.,  on-prem,  industry standard,  inventory,  shipments,  dividend, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you. Gavin, and hello everyone. Despite the challenges Gavin mentioned, we are proud of our operational agility and resilience as we are deeply managed through these challenges, while still continuing to execute our revitalization plan. Now let me take you through our quarterly results and provide an update on our outlook.,  operational agility,  resilience,  revitalization plan,  quarterly results, \\noutlook, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Consolidated net sales revenue decreased 11.1% in constant currency, principally due to lower financial volumes, which declined 12% while brand volumes declined 9.1%. We delivered net pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand mix in the U.S. as we continue to premiumize our portfolio. However, this was more than offset by the on-premise restrictions due to the Coronavirus pandemic and a corresponding negative channel mix as well as the unfavorable shipment timing in the U.S. related to the cyber security incident and the Texas winter storms.,  net sales revenue,  financial volumes,  brand volumes,  net pricing growth, \\nchannel mix, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, 20.53 Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 1.8% in constant currency as the net pricing growth more than offset the negative mix effects in Canada and Europe. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 5.6% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation and volume deleverage partially offset by cost savings. Driving cost inflation was higher transportation costs due to the continued tightening of the freight market in North America as well as higher can sourcing costs as we continue to source additional aluminum cans from all over the world to address the significant off-premise demand for our core brands.,  Net sales per hectoliter,  brand volume,  COGS per hectoliter,  cost inflation, \\ntransportation costs, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, MG&A in the quarter decreased 15.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by lower marketing spend and discretionary expenses as well as cost savings. While the timing of our marketing investments was adjusted in areas impacted by the pandemic, we continue to invest as planned beyond our core brands and key innovation. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 20.2% on a constant currency basis.,  MG&A,  marketing spend,  discretionary expenses,  cost savings,  underlying EBITDA, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Underlying free cash flow was a use of $271 million for the quarter, an increase in cash use of $54 million from the prior year period driven by lower underlying EBITDA and unfavorable working capital, driven by the timing of payments related to lower volumes, higher non-income tax deferrals due to governmental programs related to the Coronavirus pandemic and incentive payments partially offset by lower capex spend. Capital expenditures paid were $103 million for the quarter, which were largely focused on our previously announced Golden brewery modernization project. Capital expenditures were lower in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to project timing.,  underlying free cash flow,  cash use,  working capital,  capital expenditures, \\nGolden brewery modernization project, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Now let\\'s look at our results by business units. In North America, our markets experienced varying degrees of on-premise restrictions. In the U.S., our largest market, we saw progressive reopenings, and while we have seen sequential improvement in the on-premise channel, we are still not back to pre-pandemic level. In Canada, we saw significant restrictions and closures, while in Latin America, we saw restrictions easing. North America net sales revenue was down 6.3% in constant currency, due to financial volume declines of 9.4% reflecting the lower brand volume due to the on-premise restrictions and impacting the March pantry loading in the prior year, as well as unfavorable shipment timing in the U.S.,  North America,  on-premise restrictions,  financial volume declines,  brand volume,\\n March pantry loading, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In the U.S. brand volumes decreased 7.3% compared to domestic shipment declines of 9.5%, driven by the economy and premium segments. However, our U.S. above premium brand volumes grew versus the prior year and the segment reached a record high portion of our portfolio, relative to any prior year this quarter since the creation of the MillerCoors joint venture. Canada brand volumes declined 10.8% primarily due to the on-premise closures, while Latin America brand volumes grew 10.8%.,  U.S.,  brand volumes,  domestic shipment declines,  economy,  premium segments, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 2.4% in constant currency. In the U.S., net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 4.1% driven by positive brand mix made by innovation brand, Vizzy, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and ZOA. In Canada, negative channel mix more than offset the net pricing increases, while Latin America net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased due to positive sales mix.,  Net sales per hectoliter,  brand volume,  U.S.,  Canada,  Latin America, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, North America, underlying EBITDA decreased 13.3% in constant currency, due to the lower net sales revenue and higher COGS per hectoliter partially offset by a 14.4% decrease in MG&A in constant currency. The increase in COGS per hectoliter was driven primarily by inflation, including higher transportation and packaging material cost, volume deleverage and mix impacts from premiumization, partially offset by cost savings. The MG&A decline was mainly due to lower marketing spend and discretionary expenses as well as cost savings. We increased marketing investment behind core innovation brands such as Coors Seltzer, Vizzy and Blue Moon LightSky, and we increased media spending behind our iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite. These increases were more than offset by lower spend in areas impacted by the pandemic such as sports and live entertainment events.,  North America,  underlying EBITDA,  COGS per hectoliter,  MG&A,  marketing\\ninvestment, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Europe net sales revenue was down 39.5% in constant currency driven by volume declines and negative geographic and channel mix due to on-premise restrictions most meaningfully in the UK, given the on-premise lockdown for the full quarter. Europe financial volumes decreased 22% and brand volumes decreased 17% driven by a significant decline in brand volumes in the UK. However, our Central and Eastern European business has performed fairly well and was able to deliver comparable volumes basis the prior year period.,  Europe,  on-premise restrictions,  financial volume declines,  brand volume declines,\\n Central and Eastern European business, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis declined 10.4% driven by unfavorable geographic channel and brand mix, particularly from our higher margin on-premise focused UK business, partially offset by positive pricing. Underlying EBITDA was a loss of $38 million compared to a loss of $4.1 million in the prior year driven by gross margin impact of lower volume and unfavorable geographic and channel mix as a result of the pandemic, partially offset by lower MG&A expenses driven by cost mitigation actions.,  Net sales per hectoliter,  brand volume,  UK business,  gross margin,  MG&A\\nexpenses, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to the balance sheet. Net debt was $7.7 billion, down $1.1 billion from March 31, 2020 and we ended the first quarter with a strong borrowing capacity with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion U.S. credit facility as of March 31, 2021. As for our UK COVID corporate financing facility, it was closed on March 23, 2021, and we had no outstanding borrowings at that time.,  Net debt,  U.S. credit facility,  UK COVID corporate financing facility, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to our financial outlook. We are reaffirming our 2021 annual guidance provided on February 11, 2021. We expect to deliver mid-single digit net sales revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We are working aggressively to build inventories and expect domestic shipment trends in the U.S. to begin to exceed brand volume in the second half of the year. For the year, we maintain our current year goal of shipping to consumption in the U.S. In the U.S., we expect improving on-premise trends in the second quarter as we left essentially full closures in the prior year. While in Canada, we have seen increasing on-premise restrictions continuing to pressure the on-premise channel. In Europe, we\\'ve seen a gradual opening of the UK on-premise beginning in mid-April to after consumption only and we expect through the phase on-premise reopening later in the second quarter resulting in year-on-year improvement versus the prior period.,  Financial outlook,  Net sales revenue growth,  Domestic shipment trends,  On-premise\\ntrends,  Europe, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We anticipate underlying EBITDA will be flat compared to 2020 as growth is expected to be offset by COGS inflationary headwinds, but more significantly from increased investment to deliver against our revitalization plan. We intend to increase marketing spend to build on the strength of our core brands and support our successful 2020 launches including Blue Moon LightSky, Vizzy and Coors Seltzer and new innovations like Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and ZOA. With this in mind, we expect significant year-on-year increases in marketing spend over the balance of the year, and most notably in the second quarter. We expect second quarter marketing spend to be higher than the second quarter 2020 level and to approach second quarter 2019 level.,  Underlying EBITDA,  COGS inflationary headwinds,  Marketing spend,  Core brands, \\nNew innovations, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We also continue to anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $800 million, net interest expense of $270 million plus or minus 5% and an effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%. It also best reminding that in our 2020 -- that in 2020 our working capital benefited from the deferral of approximately $150 million in tax payment from various government-sponsored payment deferral programs related to the Coronavirus pandemic. And we currently anticipate the majority to be paid this year as they become due. As 2020 positioned us with greatly improved financial flexibility, better in aiming us to execute our capital allocation priorities, to invest in our business to grow our top line growth and efficiencies, pay down debt and return cash to shareholders in 2021.,  Underlying depreciation and amortization,  Net interest expense,  Effective tax rate, \\nWorking capital,  Capital allocation priorities, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We plan to continue to prudently invest in brewery modernization and production capacity and capability to support new innovations and growth initiatives, improving efficiencies and advance toward our sustainability goals. Driven by our commitment to maintaining any time upgrading our investment grade rating, we expect to continue to pay down debt and reaffirm our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.25 times by the end of 2021, and below 3 times by the end of 2022. And in line with our fourth quarter 2020 earnings comments, we currently anticipate that our Board of Directors will be in a position to reinstate a dividend in the second half of this year.,  Brewery modernization,  Production capacity,  Sustainability goals,  Debt paydown, \\nDividend reinstatement, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Now, we are pleased with our ability to adapt and overcome the past incredible challenges we faced in the first quarter. Our continued progress against our revitalization plan, the agility of our organization in the face of challenges and the commitment and resilience of our people give us the confidence, we can continue to successfully execute our revitalization plan, driving long-term sustainable revenue and underlying EBITDA growth, and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress.,  Revitalization plan,  Agility of organization,  Confidence,  Long-term sustainable\\nrevenue,  Underlying EBITDA growth, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2021, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, So with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Sadie?, Questions, Forward, Look, Take, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Greg Tierney, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations, Thank you, operator and hello, everyone. Following prepared remarks from Gavin and Tracey, we\\'ll take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and if you have more than one question, please ask your most pressing question first and then reenter the queue to follow up. If you have technical questions on the quarter, please pick them up with our IR team in the days and the weeks to follow., Questions, Prepared Remarks, Limit, Technical Questions, Follow Up, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Greg Tierney, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations, Today\\'s discussions include forward-looking statements and actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements. GAAP reconciliations for any non-US GAAP measures are included in our news release or otherwise available on our website. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the Company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period and in US dollars., Questions, Forward Looking Statements, Risk Factors, GAAP Reconciliations, Financial Results, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, Greg and thank you all for joining us today. 2020 was an incredibly challenging year for everyone, Molson Coors included. But in many respects that consider us lacking. The revitalization plan we put in place in October of 2019 positioned our Company well to weather the storms of 2020. Our business was leaner and more nimble, which put us in a better position to conserve resources as the circumstances dictated. And we deployed them effectively at the circumstances a lot, and the results bear that out., Thank You, Incredibly Challenging Year, Revitalization Plan, Business Leaner, Nimble, Resource\\nConservation, Results Bear Out, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, When you consider what we set out to do on our revitalization plan, we accomplished an incredible amount in 2020 and that has given us a tremendous springboard for 2021. Our two largest brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, our iconic core grew 6.1% and 8.6% in the US off-premise respectively. Our above premium brands in the US reached a record high percentage of the portfolio in the second half of 2020. Beyond beer, our first foray into non-alcoholic cannabis beverages through the Truss joint venture has netted the number 1 dollar share spot in the entire Canadian cannabis beverage market., Revitalization Plan, Accomplished, Incredible Amount, Iconic Core, Record High Percentage, Non-\\nAlcoholic Cannabis Beverages, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We increased our production capacity for our fast growing seltzers by approximately 400%. And we approximately doubled our annual investments in our hometown communities. That is the story of Molson Coors in 2020. Now you may be wondering why I have such confidence, especially if you only look at our consolidated top line results in the fourth quarter. But that number alone does not tell the full story. And if you only look at that piece of data, you\\'ve missed it. Our top line results in the fourth quarter were overwhelmingly due to losses resulting from government restrictions in the European on-premise channel., Production Capacity, Fast Growing Seltzers, Investments, Hometown Communities, Full Story,\\nGovernment Restrictions, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, To put it more bluntly, Europe alone accounts for 92% of our fourth quarter top line plants. So those results are not reflected of the performance we\\'ve seen across the rest of the business. And the story is very different in our largest market. How different? In the fourth quarter, Molson Coors grew net sales revenue in the United States. We grew the top line in the United States. Our plan is working. So let\\'s look deeper in our results in 2020, and what we have in store for 2021. Our first pillar under the revitalization plan was to build on the strength of our iconic core. In the US, our largest beers, Coors Light and Miller Lite delivered 6.1% and 8.6% expected growth in the off-premise. Again grew share in the premium light beer segments and they finished 2020 with stronger brand health., Revitalization Plan, Iconic Core, US Growth, European Results, Brand Health, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re pleased, but not satisfied with those results. So in 2021, we\\'re going to put even more marketing behind these two iconic brands. And we\\'re thinking big as you may have noticed around the big game of last weekend. And again, I want to point something out here. We are demonstrating our ability to grow in seltzers and expand beyond beer while strengthening our core brands. We are demonstrating, we can do both. The revitalization plan was specifically designed to free up resources, so we can meaningfully invest behind our core. Our growth in above premium and our expansion beyond beer. In the second half of 2020, above premium products hit a record high portion of our US portfolio relative to any prior-year comparable period., Marketing, Iconic Brands, Seltzers, Core Brands, Resource Freedom, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We doubled our share itself in the US moving toward our double-digit share goal by the end of this year. Vizzy is going to top 10 growth plan for nearly six straight months. And this incredible growth has been accomplished with basically just one pick. In a few weeks, we plan to add more firepower to that brand with a second variety pack. And a few weeks later, we plan to launch Vizzy Lemonade, a lineup, we believe is tailor-made for Vizzy given its unique antioxidant Vitamin C attributes. And we are excited about the opportunity for Coors Seltzer which launched at the end of September. We are seeing promising signs including the peak rates that are stronger than Bud Light Seltzer and Corona Seltzer at same point during their launch., Doubled Share, Vizzy Growth, Second Variety Pack, Vizzy Lemonade, Coors Seltzer, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, In 2021, we have strong plans to accelerate marketing support behind Coors Seltzer as well as its commitment to help save Americas\\' rivers. And that\\'s just the beginning. We are about to launch Topo Chico Hard Seltzer which is getting a lot of attention from retailers and distributors alike. Topo Chico mineral water is beloved in the biggest markets throughout the United States, especially in Texas, high potential market. Quickly on its heels, we plan to bring Topo Chico ranch water to market. And again, we see, this brand is best positioned to take advantage of the ranch water craze that has been inspired by Topo Chico mineral water enthusiast, mixing our branch water at home. And still to come is Proof Point, our first voted spirited seltzer. When all four seltzers are in market later this spring, we believe we will post the strongest most differentiated Seltzer line up in the United States. And while we started behind others in the United States, in Canada and Europe, we are early entrants in the Hard Seltzer category., Coors Seltzer, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, Marketing Support, Proof Point, Seltzer Lineup, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the next couple of weeks, we are taking both Vizzy and Coors Seltzer into Canada. In Europe, building on an existing brand partnership already in markets, the launch of our own threefold brand seltzer is planned for March and we will be leading the development of the category across Central and Eastern Europe with an own brand in the second quarter. In above premium beers, we have high expectations for Blue Moon LightSky, which ended 2020 as the number 1 new beer in the United States per Nielsen. We\\'ve expanded its production capacity by approximately 400%. We\\'re putting more marketing muscle behind it and we believe, this is a brand and its going to continue to rise for quite some time., Vizzy, Coors Seltzer, Canada, Europe, Blue Moon LightSky, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our regional craft portfolio in the United States grew 17% as per Nielsen in 2020. Outpacing, the crafts segment once again. In next month, we will be taking Hop Valley national in the US and Canada. It\\'s our first national IPA. We believe, it will be another driver of growth for our above premium portfolio. And do not forget about Yuengling this form -- the newly formed joint venture plans to bring Yuengling to one of America\\'s biggest beer drinking states, Texas. The reception has already been incredible. And there is significant upside potential with Yuengling as the joint venture begins its Westwood expansion., Regional Craft Portfolio, Hop Valley, National Expansion, Yuengling Joint Venture, Texas Expansion, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, At the beginning of last year, we changed our name to the Molson Coors Beverage Company, and it wasn\\'t just words. By the end of the year, our non-alc strategy came into focus, repiloting our own brands with our partner, L.A. Libations, we\\'ve taken equity investments in other opportunities, including two with legendary non-alc innovator, Lance Collins, we signed distribution agreements to enter the fast-growing space like RTD coffee with La Colombe and energy drinks with ZOA through our new energy drink partnership with the leadership team led by Dwayne Rock Johnson. ZOA is getting very positive reaction from retailers and distributors. The Rock isn\\'t just putting his name on this. He is personally making close to retailers. We\\'re bringing that to market this spring. We think that ZOA could be a game-changing in the energy drink space., Non-Alc Strategy, Partnership, Investments, Distribution Agreements, ZOA Energy Drink, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Truss Canada, our Canadian cannabis joint venture with -- launched the beverage portfolio in August. And by December, they jumped to the number 1 dollar share position with four of the top five cannabis beverage SKUs in Canada. And Truss USA is building on that. Actually a first line up was throughout CBD beverages in Colorado, which entered the market in December. We are learning a lot about the exciting category following the launch. This entire line-up is a tremendous growth opportunity for our business. It will be a driving force behind our goal to build our emerging growth division into a $1 billion revenue business by 2023. And as a reminder that ambition does not include hard seltzers., Truss Canada, Truss USA, CBD Beverages, Emerging Growth Division, Hard Seltzers, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, And we recently announced our first entry into the fast-growing RTD cocktail space through an exclusive equity and distribution agreement with super, an above premium tequila-based Paloma. Last year, we also made major investments to help our business grow the top line we invested in our e-commerce capabilities, all around the globe with more staff and more robust digital capabilities and it paid off last year. With 230% growth in e-commerce in the US alone. We expanded our Seltzer production capacity by approximately 400%. And we also expanded our Light Sky production capacity by approximately 400%. We completed a sleek can production line capable of manufacturing approximately 750 million sleek cans annually., Truss Canada, Truss USA, CBD Beverages, Emerging Growth Division, RTD Coctail Space, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Any on the topic of kent, I\\'m really pleased to say that our packaging material suppliers vastly improved with glass bottles, paperboard and toll cans with all returning to more material. In fact. our Coors Light can inventory is higher than it was at this point last year. And our industry standard can supply is improving. We have sourced cans from four continents and worked closely with our supplier to keep up very high rate of consumer demand and we expect to return to normal material availability by the end of this quarter., Kent, Packaging Material, Glass Bottles, Paperboard, Toll Cans, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We will continue investing in our capabilities throughout the year as we work to grow our ability to produce higher margin above premium products. Last but certainly not least, is how we are supporting our people and our communities. This one is particularly important to me. When I took over as CEO, I made it clear that I want Molson Coors at a people first culture. Net approach guided our decision making throughout the last year. The work in this space is never done, but we are making important progress. Last time, we set a goal of increasing the representation of people of color in United States by 25% by the end of 2023. Across the country, among salaried employees and in leadership positions, each market availability shows we have room for improvement., Investing, Margin, People First Culture, Representation of Color, Goal Setting, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We have made progress toward that goal and we expect to continue to do so. We also increased our support for organizations dedicated to quality, common, racial justice, community building and provided nearly 3 million meals to families in our hometown communities struggling with food and security. But we must do more. So today I\\'m proud to announce that not only will we recommit to matching last year\\'s investments in our communities, we have also committed to spend a total of $1 billion with diverse suppliers over the next three years. This is a commitment that benefits all of us. A wider base of talented suppliers, with different backgrounds and life experiences will be a benefit to our Company, and a diverse supply to earn our business will be able to turn in -- in turn hire more talented employees into their businesses., Investments, Community Building, Diverse Suppliers, Food Security, Goal Setting, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Last time we said that Molson Coors\\' response to addressing racial injustice would not just be a moment in time. Passing thing satisfied and forgotten other priorities took over. That would be unacceptable. Our commitment to investing in our communities and striving for equal opportunity for all people will not fade. Even with the unforeseeable challenges of last year, we built on the strength of our iconic core. The second half of 2020, we achieved a record high portion of our US portfolio in above premium products. We expanded beyond the beer aisle. We invested in our capabilities, we supported our people and our communities. And we are not about to stop now., Investing, Communities, Equal Opportunity, Iconic Core, Record High, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, When I took over this role, I told you that we would plan and invest to grow our top line. We\\'re going to follow through on that and we\\'re on the pathway there. This is our revitalization plan and action. I know there have been questions about whether or not we can execute all of this, but no one has to wonder any longer. We\\'ll be doing it, right now today. And now, I\\'ll turn it over to Tracey, who can provide you with more detail on our financial performance and our outlook for 2021. Tracey?, Investing, Growth, Top Line, Revitalization Plan, Financial Performance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Gavin and hello, everyone. The coronavirus pandemic had a significant impact on our 2020 financial performance primarily due to the on-premise restrictions and lockdown. Our Europe business was the most impacted, particularly in the UK. There are business skews heavily toward the on-premise and drove revenue and EBITDA declines in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. In fact, Europe which accounted for only 16% of our revenue in 2020 contributed to 61% of revenue decline, and 83% of our EBITDA decline for the year, and 92% of the revenue decline and 56% of our EBITDA decline for the fourth quarter., Coronavirus Pandemic, Financial Performance, On-Premise Restrictions, Lockdown, Europe Business, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Despite these incredible challenges in 2020, we are proud of our resilience and the financial performance as we have navigated through this unprecedented times. Now, let me take you through our full year performance and then I\\'ll touch on our quarterly results, before moving on to our outlook. Recapping the year, consolidated net sales revenue decreased 8.7% in constant currency of which North America was down 4.3% while Europe was down 28.4% on a constant currency basis. While we delivered net pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand and packaged mix in the US. This is more than offset by volume declines and unfavorable channel mix principally driven by varying degrees of on-premise restrictions throughout much of the year due to the coronavirus pandemic, which also drove packaging material constraints due to the unprecedented can demand., Resilience, Financial Performance, Net Sales Revenue, On-Premise Restrictions, Packaging Material\\nConstraints, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Brand volumes declined 7.8% and financial volumes declined 8.9%. North American shipment trends improved in the second half of the year as certain packaging material constraints ease and we both distributed inventory. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis grew 1.1% in constant currency due to pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand and package mix in the US. The success of our both premium innovations including Vizzy, Blue Moon LightSky and Coors Seltzer, help drive US net sales per hectoliter up 2.3% for the year. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 2.8% on a constant currency basis driven by cost inflation including higher transportation costs, volume deleverage and mix impacts from premiumization in North America, partially offset by cost savings. Higher can sourcing cost in North America contributed to the higher cost inflation. After the onset of the coronavirus pandemic we aggressively begin sourcing additional aluminum cans from all over the world to support our core brands to address unprecedented off-premise demand., Brand Volumes, Financial Volumes, Net Sales Per Hectoliter, COGS Per Hectoliter, Aluminum Can\\nSourcing Costs, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Also we saw tightening of the freight market throughout the year which has led to higher transportation costs. Underlying MG&A decreased 9.9% on a constant currency basis as we quickly took action, pivoting spend away from the areas impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly live in the payments events and sporting events due to shortened or delayed seasons such as the delayed start of the NH-alc season into 2021. In the second half of the year, we began to progressively increase marketing spend, particularly in social and TV media stepping up support behind our new innovations, such as Vizzy, Blue Moon LightSky and Coors Seltzer in alignment with additional supply coming online as well as continuing to support our core Coors Light, Miller Lite and other -- our chronic core brands., Freight Market, Transportation Costs, MG&A, Marketing Spend, New Innovations, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, MG&A declines were also driven by targeted cost mitigation actions and significant cost savings in the fifth year of our revitalization cost savings program. In aggregate, we delivered approximately $270 million across MG&A and cost of goods sold, chasing us on track to meet our $600 million target in total gross savings. These reductions were offset by innovations, in fact in lower incentive compensation and a non-recurring vendor benefit in the prior year which we referenced last quarter. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 10% on a constant currency basis. Underlying free cash flow was $1.3 billion for the year, a decrease of $104 million from the prior year driven by lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash taxes partially offset by favorable working capital., MG&A, Cost Savings, EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Working Capital, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, The working capital benefit was driven by the deferral of approximately $150 million in tax payments on various government bonds with payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic of which, we currently anticipate the majority to be paid in 2021 as they become due. Capital expenditures incurred were $530 million for the year. With improved liquidity and strong cash management, we were able to accelerate certain investments in expanding our production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives. In addition to the strong free cash flow performance, we made tremendous stride in improving our financial flexibility, including continuing to pay down debt favorably amending our US revolving credit facilities and suspending our dividend in May for the remainder of 2020., Working Capital, Tax Payments, Capital Expenditures, Financial Flexibility, Debt, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We reduced our net debt position by $1.1 billion in 2020 and reduce our trailing 12 month net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to 3.5 times as we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. Now let\\'s discuss the fourth quarter. We\\'re again Europe due to the on-premise lockdown had a significant and disproportionately negative impact on our results. Consolidated net sales revenue declined 8.3% in constant currency principally due to financial volume declines as a result of the on-premise restrictions along with corresponding negative channel mix, partially offset by net pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand and package mix in the US., Net Debt Position, Net Sales Revenue, On-Premise Lockdown, Financial Volume Declines, Channel Mix, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, North America net sales revenue was down 1% in constant currency. However, in the US, despite increased on-premise restrictions and aluminum can supply constraints, we delivered net sales revenue growth of 1.9% in the quarter. And we continue to build this distributor inventory in the US with brand volumes down 6.2% compared to domestic shipment declines of 2.3%. Growth in the US business was more than offset by lower volumes and negative mix in Canada, and to a lesser Latin America as a result of the on-premise restrictions., Net Sales Revenue, On-Premise Restrictions, Aluminum Can Supply Constraints, Brand Volumes,\\nDistributor Inventory, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In Europe, net sales revenue was down 59.4% in constant currency driven by volume declines and negative mix due to increased on premise restriction with the most meaningful in the UK, which experienced a return to almost total on-premise locked down for November and the historically strong month of December and with the subdued nature of many festive celebrations during the fourth quarter, we did not see a big shift of volume into the off-premise., Net Sales Revenue, On-Premise Restrictions, Volume Declines, Negative Mix, Festive Celebrations, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.7% in constant currency reflecting net pricing growth in North America and Europe more than offsetting the negative mix effect of the various market dynamics and consumer shift caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In the US net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 4.2% driven by favorable sales mix from new innovations and strong net parking growth. While in Europe, net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis decreased 8.2% due to unfavorable mix, particularly driven by the higher margin UK business which more than offset pricing increases. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 6.4% on a constant currency basis, as we saw a greater impact on price inflation and US mix premiumization in Q4 compared to the full year., Net Sales Per Hectoliter, Brand Volume, Pricing Growth, Mix Effect, COGS Per Hectoliter, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, MG&A in the quarter increased 5.8% on a constant currency basis due to higher planned marketing spend to support our core brands and key innovation as well as backing lower incentive compensation and a non-recurring vendor benefit in the fourth quarter of 2019. This was partially offset by cost savings and lower discretionary spend. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 33.6% on a constant currency basis disproportionately driven by Europe. Given the length and severity of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our Europe business as well as the projected recovery currently expected in certain on-premise markets, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $1.5 billion in our Europe segment. We also recognized $39.6 million of asset impairment charges in our North American segment. These charges are non-cash and are not included in underlying results., MG&A, Constant Currency, EBITDA, Goodwill Impairment Charge, Asset Impairment Charges, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, So this takes me to our financial outlook. As you may recall, on March the 27 of last year, we withdrew our guidance due to the uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic. While uncertainty remains in an effort to help enhanced visibility, we have determined to reinstate our practice of providing guidance. We have also determined to adjust the matrix provided which includes adding garden for net sales revenue, a metric which aligns with our revitalization can goals for driving top line growth as well as net debt to underlying EBITDA leverage ratios, given our commitment to remaining investment grade., Financial Outlook, Guidance, Net Sales Revenue, Uncertainty, Investment Grade, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We are very proud of our performance and agility navigating the coronavirus pandemic and executing against our revitalization plan, but recognize that headwinds remain. The pandemic continues to impact our business due to on-premise losses across all our geographies and disproportionately starting in Europe as well as Canada. We expect big domestic shipment trends in the US to continue to be higher than brand volume trends in the third quarter as we continue to build inventories hitting into the peak season. For the year, we maintain our annual goal of shipping to consumption in the US. In Europe, we continue to experience significant lockdowns and expect third quarter volumes will be materially impacted due to the prior year period similar to what was experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020., Pandemic, On-Premise Losses, Revitalization Plan, Domestic Shipments, Brand Volume Trends,\\nLockdowns, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, For 2021, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth. 2021 is intended to be a Europe investment as we continue to de-lever our revitalization plan and drive toward long-term growth. This entails increasing year-over-year marketing spend to build on the strength of our core brands and support our successful 2020 launches including Blue Moon LightSky, Vizzy and Coors Seltzer and new innovations to come as well as investing in further expanding our capabilities to drive productivity and efficiency. We expect significant increases in Spain, beginning in the second quarter, which is the prior comparable quarter. While we continue to expect revitalization plan savings as I discussed, given this increase in along with cost headwinds related to higher inflation including transportation costs and continued premiumization of our portfolio, we anticipate 2021 underlying EBITDA to be approximately flat compared to the prior year., Net Sales Revenue Growth, Europe Investment, Marketing Spend, Core Brands, New Innovations,\\nUnderlying EBITDA, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $800 million, net interest expense of $270 million plus or minus passed the same. And an effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%. We entered 2021 with greatly improved financial flexibility. Later enabling us to not only continue to invest in our business to continue to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders in 2021. As I mentioned we significantly reduced our net debt position by $1.1 billion in 2020 and reduce our leverage ratio to 3.5 times as of December 31, 2020. We are proud of this progress and are establishing a target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.25 times by the end of 2021 and below 3 times by the end of 2022. And we currently anticipate that our Board of Directors will be in a position to reinstate a dividend in the second half of this year. We are doing all of this while continuing our commitment to maintaining anytime upgrading our investment grade rating., Depreciation, Net Interest Expense, Effective Tax Rate, Financial Flexibility, Net Debt Ratio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Given the operating environment, we are pleased with our financial performance, which underscores our strong progress against our revitalization spend and the resilience of our Company and our people to successfully navigate and overcome challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. While these challenges have created some near term fluctuations in financial and operating results, we are confident on the right cause of driving toward long-term revenue and underlying EBITDA growth. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress. So with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?, Financial Performance, Revitalization Spend, Resilience, Long-Term Growth, Operating Results, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 3, Greg Tierney, Vice President of Financial planning and analysis and Investor Relations, All right. Thank you, Danielle, and hello, everyone. Following prepared remarks from Gavin and Tracey, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] If you have technical questions on the quarter, please take them up with me or Traci Mangini on the IR team in the days and weeks to follow. Today\\'s discussion includes forward-looking statements and actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.

And GAAP reconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our news release or otherwise available on our website. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars., Financial Results, Forward-Looking Statements, Risk Factors, GAAP Reconciliations, Comparable Prior\\nYear Period, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 3, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, Greg, and thank you all for joining us today. Well, what a year it\\'s been so far. If you\\'re like most people, there are probably a lot of words that come to mind when you think of 2020. But for Molson Coors, this year, can be summarized in three words: persistence, perseverance and progress. That is how 2020 has been defined by the Molson Coors Beverage Company as we drive for top line growth. We\\'re very pleased with our performance in the third quarter as we beat top and bottom line expectations and made tangible progress on our revitalization plans. We had bold plans at the beginning of 2020, to build on the strength of our iconic core brands, aggressively grow our Above Premium portfolio, expand beyond the beer aisle, invest in our capabilities and support our people and our communities. Yet 2020 has presented new obstacles for everyone, for which we\\'ve had to adjust. Like all other beverage companies, one of the biggest challenges this year has been packaging supply. To put into perspective the scope of the challenges, we sold 300 million more cans of beer in the first nine months of 2020 than we did in the same period in 2019 in the United States alone. And there have been times over the past few months when demand for tall cans was four times what it was in 2019. I\\'m pleased to report that while work remains, inventory is steadily improving in the U.S. We are approaching historical levels of paperboard supply. We are confirming most orders for bottled beer and seeing steady improvement in supply. Our 12-ounce industry standard can supply is stabilizing, and we anticipate it will continue to increase through the year as we return to full inventory, and we are starting to more fully cover demand for tall cans and expect steady improvement in inventory through the balance of the year. When 2020 has shown as challenges like this, we\\'ve, met each challenge head on, and we have never lost sight of our plan., Persistence, Perseverance, Progress, Revitalization Plans, Packaging Supply, Inventory Improvement, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We will continue to be nimble, adapting to the environment to ensure we are achieving the highest possible return on our marketing investments, while supporting strong brand equity. Therefore, as of the third quarter, some of our anticipated fourth quarter spend will be dependent on factors, including the occurrence of live sports and events. And finally, as discussed on our second quarter call, in the fourth quarter, we will stifle lower incentive compensation and a nonrecurring vendor benefit, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019 and totaled approximately $27 million. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, we have shifted our focus to ensure adequate liquidity for the near term while positioning the business for medium and long-term success. This included a desire to maintain our investment-grade rating, which is important for all of our stakeholders. Being investment-grade rated reduces our cost of debt, improved our access to capital markets, including commercial paper and gives us more operational flexibility to execute against our strategy. As previously discussed, we have significantly improved our liquidity position by favorably amending the covenant terms of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, adding a GBP300 million commercial paper facility for our U.K. business, which is incremental to the borrowing capacity under the $1.5 billion facility, suspending the dividend in May for the remainder of 2020, reducing previously planned capital expenditures by around $200 million for 2020 and generally reducing discretionary spend where possible. And in the third quarter, we continued to reduce our debt position with a payment of CAD500 million that is due, using a combination of cash and commercial paper. As of quarter end, we had reduced our net debt position by just over $1.2 billion since we began the revitalization program. And we have maintained strong borrowing capacities on both our facilities., Marketing investments, brand equity, liquidity, stakeholders, covenant terms, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As of October 29, 2020, we had $1.4 billion under our U.S. facility and the full GBP300 million under the U.K. facility in available capacity. So we invested in our business to support medium- and long-term growth objectives. In addition to necessary safety and maintenance projects, we are making capital investments that deliver cost savings and high-return growth initiatives such as our significant investment behind hard seltzer and innovations in our Fort Worth and Milwaukee brewery. And over the next few years, we plan to prioritize capital investment to include hundreds of millions of dollars to add significant capacity for our innovation, including seltzers and slim can capacity. Given the operating environment, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial performance, making another quarter of progress on our revitalization plan to drive long-term value creation. We achieved solid financial and operating results and again, exceeded top and bottom line expectations. And we did so while navigating the continued changes posed by the coronavirus pandemic, further improving our liquidity and investing in efforts to advance our long-term goals. We are mindful of the challenges and continued uncertainty ahead and remain focus on doing what is best not only in the near term but positioning the business for medium and long-term success, and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress.,  investment,  growth,  capacity,  liquidity,  goals, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, And with that, we look forward to taking your questions.

Good morning, and thank you everybody for joining us today. We had a strong second quarter, as is evidenced by the results we released this morning, executing well against our two main objectives as the world continues to adjust to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. But before we talk about our second quarter performance, I would like to address the challenge of systemic racism. Racism is not a new issue, and I\\'m not naive enough to believe that our business alone can solve the problem that has plagued the United States and many parts of the world for so long. But I do believe we have the opportunity and the responsibility to try and be part of the solution and that is why we\\'ve been unequivocal that we believe Black Lives Matter and that\\'s why we are backing up our words with action.,  execution,  results,  racism,  challenge,  action, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We developed a new action plan designed to build a more inclusive culture and increased diversity within Molson Coors. Our intent is to conduct a culture assessment of our practices and policies to guide further -- future improvement across all of our business units. Increase the representation of people of color in our U.S. operation by 25% by the end of 2023, across the country, among salaried employees and also in leadership positions. Improve our hiring practices and leadership development programs to bring in highly skilled diverse talent to develop our future leaders and much more. We\\'ve already committed to donate $1.5 million to 23 local and national organizations, dedicated to equality, empowerment justice and community building, engaging our own employee resource groups in the process of selecting which groups to support.,  inclusive culture,  diversity,  representation,  hiring practices,  donations, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, This is only a start. It cannot be a moment in time that passes by, soon to be forgotten. We are committed to meaningful long-term change inside and outside our business. Our efforts to lead -- leave a positive imprint done [Phonetic] in there.,  commitment,  long-term change,  positive imprint,  leadership,  impact, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Two weeks ago, we released our annual sustainability report in which we announced progress against our 2025 sustainability goals. Highlights from the report include further reductions in emissions, the fact that more than 99% of our packaging is now considered reusable, recyclable or compostable and an increase in the number of our zero waste to landfill facilities. Addressing racism and protecting the environment are not societal issues to be addressed by someone else, it\\'s on us to help build a better future. And doing so is good for our business and the communities in which we operate.,  sustainability report,  emissions,  packaging,  zero waste,  societal issues, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, The day is very clear. Fostering a more diverse and inclusive environment and exhibiting social responsibility increases employee engagement, which leads to more discretionary effort and stronger performance, which leads to better business outcomes. The actions we are taking will help our business compete and win in the future and build in the progress we are making today, as is evidence by our strong second quarter results.,  diversity,  inclusive environment,  social responsibility,  employee engagement, \\nbusiness outcomes, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Last quarter we told you that our overarching focus as the whole world deals with the coronavirus pandemic were centered on two objectives. Navigating the short-term to protect our employees and to mitigate the short-term business challenges of the coronavirus and secondly, positioning our business for long-term success. And that\\'s just what we\\'ve done. Through strong management and incredible work by our teams, we had a strong second quarter executing well against these two objectives and beating expectations for both top and bottom-line performance in Q2. We did it while delivering an improved cash position and preserving the biggest firepower in our marketing budgets so they can be ramped up in the back half of the year when we expect they will be most effective.,  coronavirus pandemic,  short-term focus,  long-term success,  strong management, \\nmarketing budgets, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'ve also benefited from the fact that our business is not as exposed to challenging markets as many of our competitors, such as the continued problems facing suppliers with much more sizable operations in places like South Africa and Mexico. At the end of Q2, the benefits of our work to navigate the short-term impacts of the coronavirus are clear. Coors Light achieved its highest segment share ever in the United States. Let me repeat that. Coors Light achieved its highest segment share ever in the U.S. Blue Moon LightSky became the top selling new beer of 2020 per Nielsen and it now ranks among the top three growth brands in the entire craft segment also, per Nielsen, behind Blue Moon Belgian White. Vizzy has already made a name for itself in the increasingly crowded U.S. hard seltzer market. Despite not launching nationally until April, it is already the number three seltzer in a number of markets and is beating Bud Light seltzer in repeat purchase rates.,  challenging markets,  Coors Light,  segment share,  Nielsen,  hard seltzer, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our Truss Canada joint venture shipped its first products and we are very encouraged by the consumer reception. And in the U.S., our new joint venture Truss USA is already piloting opportunities for non-alcohol hemp derived CBD beverages in Colorado. We have driven progress in Canada through growth in craft in the off-premise, leveraging the North American innovation Belgian Moon LightSky, as well as growth in local craft brands in Canada, such as Creemore and BDM.,  Truss Canada,  consumer reception,  non-alcohol hemp derived CBD beverages,  growth in\\ncraft,  local craft brands, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our Canadian innovation portfolio is also off to a strong start with Aquarelle, a line of vodka-based can drinks. Arizona Hard Green Tea & Vine and non-alcoholic hot water. We became an early entrant in the European hard seltzer space by signing an exclusive agreement with British hard seltzer maker, Bodega Bay and we\\'re extending beyond our beer portfolio after signing with Miami cocktail companies to distribute the growing brands in the United Kingdom and Ireland.,  Aquarelle,  Arizona Hard Green Tea & Vine,  non-alcoholic hot water,  Bodega Bay, \\nMiami cocktail companies, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, And last certainly but not least, we strengthened our financial position. We renegotiated our bank governance to help ease potential short-term liquidity constraints and we suspended our dividend payable for the balance of the 2020 fiscal year, decision that we believe will put us in a stronger cash and leverage position during the pandemic. In light of these steps, we were pleased that Moody\\'s affirmed our credit rating and kept our outlook stable.,  financial position,  bank governance,  liquidity constraints,  dividend payable, \\ncredit rating, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, So, I could be wrong. It wasn\\'t easy but we were able to deliver the strong quarter despite the challenges facing our world and our industry today. Tourism in Europe has dropped dramatically and pubs in the U.K. were closed through the end of Q2,as a result of the pandemic. Some of our Latin American markets were shut down completely or partially for much of the quarter. And while a number of establishments are larger reopen typically in phases, some of these were quickly closed down again in the United States. Consumer demand has shifted in ways no one could have foreseen six months ago. When bars and restaurants are shuttered in the early parts of Q2, demand for kegs in the U.S. went to zero and conversely, demand for cans went through the roof.,  challenges,  tourism,  pubs,  consumer demand,  kegs, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Every company that makes anything in the 12-ounce can has been challenged to some degree by the global can shortage. For example, Coke and Pepsi have acknowledge challenges and Ball Corporation announced new plans to increase production capacity on cans. At Molson Coors, we have been producing and shipping canned beer at significantly higher rates than in recent years, though it hasn\\'t been enough to meet the historically high orders we\\'re seeing.,  global can shortage,  Coke,  Pepsi,  Ball Corporation,  Molson Coors, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, To put a finer point in the level of demand we are seeing, we eclipsed July fourth week shipment days in the United States four times already this year. That\\'s unheard off. You\\'ll remember on our Q1 call, I said constraints on cans and paperboard will be a challenge in the summer in North America. All along we\\'ve been working with our distributors in North America to try to manage it. We\\'ve been getting as many cans as possible from our suppliers, who have been tremendous partners for us and we\\'ve worked to source more cans from countries around the world.,  demand,  shipment days,  constraints,  cans,  paperboard, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, At this point, we remain tight on the Coors Light token but are seeing the situation begin to improve with respect to 12-ounce industry standard cans. We are also making progress in securing more paperboard as our supplier has recently added to their production capacity, but they are still catching up on some SKUs. Despite all of these obstacles, we continue to navigate the coronavirus effectively today, while simultaneously working to position our business to succeed in the long-term. There is no better example than our new investment, which is intended to quintuple our U.S. seltzer production capacity.,  Coors Light token,  12-ounce industry standard cans,  paperboard,  coronavirus, \\nnew investment, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Building on the strength of Vizzy\\'s launch and the upcoming launch of Coors Seltzer, we announced a multi-million dollar project at our Fort Worth, Texas brewery, which includes the installation of a new canning line completed earlier this year and a state-of-the-art filtration system expected to be finished later this fall. As I mentioned before, our brands will have additional marketing support in the months ahead. We preserved our marketing firepower for comp [Phonetic] when we expect it would have the most impact. Bars and restaurants are starting to come back, admittedly in fits and starts and we expect to increase investment.,  Vizzy\\'s launch,  Coors Seltzer,  multi-million dollar project,  new canning line, \\nstate-of-the-art filtration system, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We completed our acquisition of Atwater brewing, a craft brewer that gives us a foothold in the Eastern parts of the Midwest and one that produces craft seltzer and beverages that extend beyond the beer aisle and we\\'re excited about our new partner and their offerings. And speaking of partnerships, we recently announced, we will be an official partner of the new Las Vegas Raiders football team with the official domestic beer, the official craft beer and the official hard seltzer. One way that we continue to invest behind our brands even in some challenging times. And for those of you that are excited that baseball season is under way, I\\'d remind you that we entered the 2020 with partnerships with 50% of all MLB teams, and we have manage the short-term and are confident in our plans to position the business for the long-term.,  acquisition,  partnership,  Las Vegas Raiders,  baseball season,  MLB teams, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Even in the midst of such uncertainty brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, based on what we have seen and what we have done, we intend to maintain the strength of our iconic brands, grow our above premium business and expand beyond the beer aisle.,  coronavirus pandemic,  iconic brands,  above premium business,  expansion beyond the\\nbeer aisle, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, And now, I\\'ll pass it over to Tracey for the financial highlights.,  Tracey,  financial highlights, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. I will first cover the quarter on a consolidated and regional basis, then move to our outlook. With the continued uncertainty in the current environment, we have determined not to reinstate guidance at this time, but we will be giving additional forward visibility on trends and offering a perspective on how we believe we will be impacted by the coronavirus in the future. We do not we expect to continue to give this visibility once conditions have stabilized or we resume guidance.,  quarter,  environment,  coronavirus,  guidance,  trends, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, So to recap the quarter, net sales revenue decreased 14.3% in constant currency, largely due to brand volume declines, principally in on-premise channel during the quarter, along with the resulting negative mix implications across all major markets. Additionally, our under shipment position in the U.S. continue during Q2, mostly due to the constrained supplies of 12-ounce cans, as well as paperboard that Gavin just mentioned. These impacts were partially offset by higher net pricing in the U.S. and Canada.,  brand volume declines,  on-premise channel,  under shipment position,  constrained\\nsupplies,  higher net pricing, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 0.3% in constant currency, reflecting positive net pricing in U.S. and Canada, more than offsetting negative mix effects globally due to the various market dynamics and consumer shift caused by the coronavirus. Specifically, the shutdown of the on-premise locations as well as the timing of the gradual reopening of on-premise locations had an adverse impact on geographic mix in Europe. And notably, as many of our higher-end products are skewed toward the on-premise, the closure of these establishments had an unfavorable impact on our brand and channel mix. Worldwide brand volume decreased 11.6%, while financial volume decreased 12.5%, reflecting unfavorable shipment timing in the U.S. and lower contract brewing volumes.,  net sales per hectoliter,  brand volume,  on-premise locations,  geographic mix, \\nfinancial volume, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased in currency basis driven by volume deleverage, partially offset by cost savings and a favorable resolution of our property tax appeal for our Golden Colorado brewery, and then a 30.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by the suspension of on-premise activations and elimination and reduction of spend in areas that have been significantly impacted by the coronavirus, for example, sports and lobby entertainment events.,  underlying COGS per hectoliter,  volume deleverage,  cost savings,  property tax\\nappeal,  on-premise activations, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We also adjusted the timing of marketing investments behind brands and packs where we experienced the plant constraints. In addition, our G&A spend was lower as we delivered against our cost savings and revitalization plans. As a result, underlying EBITDA increased 2.2% on a constant currency basis. Underlying free cash flow of $796.4 million for the six months end of June 30, 2020 was $235.7 million favorable to prior year. Driven by favorable working capital and lower cash paid for taxes as well as lower cash paid for interest, partially offset by lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash paid for capital expenditures.,  marketing investments,  plant constraints,  G&A spend,  cost savings plans,  free\\ncash flow, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Working capital and cash tax favorability was driven by the deferral of more than $500 million in tax payments from various government relief programs into some of our geographies in response to the coronavirus pandemic, of which, a significant portion is expected to be paid in the second half of the year with the remaining amount to be paid in 2021. In North America, net sales revenue decreased 7.9% in constant currency. This decline was driven by brand volume declines, unfavorable shipment timing in the U.S. and lower contract brewing volumes. North America brand volumes decreased 7.8% as the on-premise closures during the quarter more than offset the continued strains, particularly, the -- in the U.S. in the off-premise.,  working capital,  cash tax favorability,  government relief programs,  brand volume\\ndeclines,  on-premise closures, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In the U.S., brand volumes decreased 5.2% compared to domestic shipment declines of 6.5% in the quarter. Net sales hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 0.9% in constant currency, driven by favorable geographic mix, favorable package mix and net pricing increases in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by negative brand and channel mix attributed to the shift of volume from the on-premise to the off-premise. In the U.S., net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 1%, driven by positive mix, with favorable package mix more than offsetting negative brand mix in addition to the net pricing increases. In Canada, negative mix more than offset the net pricing increases while in Latin America, net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis also declined.,  brand volumes,  domestic shipment declines,  geographic mix,  package mix,  net\\npricing, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Underlying EBITDA increased 13.8% in constant currency as MG&A reductions more than offset the unfavorable impact to gross profit from lower volume. The MG&A reduction was driven by cost mitigation actions taken, the shifting of certain marketing spend and reduced discretionary spendings, limited new hiring and travel restrictions. In addition, we continued to deliver cost savings related to the revitalization plans.,  MG&A reductions,  unfavorable impact to gross profit,  cost mitigation actions, \\nshifting of certain marketing spend,  reduced discretionary spendings, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Europe, which is more heavily skewed toward the on-premise, net sales on a reported basis decreased 42.4% in constant currency, due to lower volumes and lower net sales per hectoliter reflecting the impacts from the coronavirus. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis declined 12.7% in constant currency, driven by unfavorable channel and geographic mix particularly, the bigger impact to the high margin U.K. business as well as slightly unfavorable net pricing.,  Europe,  on-premise,  coronavirus,  net sales per hectoliter,  geographic mix, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Financial volume decreased 24.8% and brand volumes decreased 21.4% with only partial on-premise opening seen during Q2 in some of our smaller European markets. Europe\\'s underlying EBITDA of $31 million decreased 66.9% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year, driven by gross margin impacts of volume declines and cost inflation, partially offset by lower MG&A expenses as a result of cost mitigation action as in -- following the coronavirus pandemic, as well as lower incentive compensation.,  financial volume,  brand volumes,  on-premise opening,  gross margin impacts,  MG&A\\nexpenses, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In Europe, brand volumes were down 21.4% in Q2, driven by closures of on-premise accounts, which were in full force at the beginning of the quarter and began to lift only in certain smaller markets in Central and Western Europe toward the end of the quarter. The U.K., did not reopen until July, the 4th. Our relative share position in Europe is significantly higher in the on-premise channel than in the off-premise, so we expect to be disproportionately impacted by the closures in this channel and expect to share losses during the closure period. In the off-premise, we were initially not able to meet the full demand following the abrupt channel shift due to our level of capacity and actions to protect the safety of our people, but this situation has improved significantly during the quarter as we have taken measures to increase capacity, while not compromising on the safety of our people.,  brand volumes,  on-premise accounts,  off-premise channel,  relative share position,\\n capacity, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Based on 2019 results, our on-premise business in Europe comprised approximately 50% to 55% of NSR and a higher portion of our gross margin. While in the second quarter, nearly all of our sales in Europe were from off-premise. We are taking significant steps in reducing spending for both capital investments and expense and have taken steps around cash collections to minimize collection risk. And despite these actions, prolong closures or limited reopening of the on-premise business will continue to have a meaningful impact on our European and total company gross margin and profitability.,  on-premise business,  off-premise sales,  capital investments,  expense,  cash\\ncollections, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Which takes me to our financial outlook. On March the 27th, we withdrew our guidance due to uncertainty, driven by the coronavirus pandemic. With the continued spread of the virus and the reversal of certain on-premise reopening, that uncertainty remains. As a result, we have determined not to reinstate guidance at this time. The pandemic continues to impact our business due to on-premise losses across all our geographies and disproportionately in Europe, and we expect negative trends in volume, NSR, mix and unfavorable fixed cost absorption in COGS will continue for the foreseeable future. The strength of demand in the off-premise has been unprecedented, but it does not fully offset the on-premise losses and while the current on-premise trends continue, we don\\'t expect that any increase in total off-premise volumes due to channel shifting will be sufficient to offset the on-premise losses.,  financial outlook,  coronavirus pandemic,  on-premise losses,  geographies,  COGS, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Also, we expect the industry wide supply constraints on 12-ounce cans will remain an issue for us in Q3. However, due to our proactive assets [Phonetic] decreases, we expect domestic shipment trends in the U.S. to be higher than brand volume trends as we build inventories for the balance of the year. As it pertains to MG&A, we expect our marketing investment to increase in the second half of the year in North America to support our core brands as well as innovations like Blue Moon NightSky, Vizzy and the August launch of Coors Seltzer. Some of the spend will be dependent on a number of factors including the anticipated return of last fall.,  industry wide supply constraints,  proactive assets decreases,  domestic shipment trends,\\n MG&A investment,  marketing investment, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Finally, we also want to call out some unfavorable G&A expense comparison. As we will be cycling lower incentive compensation particularly long-term incentive compensation from the prior year, in both the third and fourth quarters, as well as a non-recurring vendor benefit in the U.S. in quarter four of last year. Notwithstanding the current environment, our continued desire to maintain our investment grade rating and we have taken a number of steps to ensure we protect our balance sheet and put ourselves in the best position to best navigate the coronavirus pandemic.,  unfavorable G&A expense comparison,  incentive compensation,  vendor benefit,  balance\\nsheet,  coronavirus pandemic, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As it pertains to our borrowing capability, during the second quarter, we repaid the full $1 billion that was outstanding on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility or RCF. As a result, we had no borrowings on outstanding on our RCF at the end of the second quarter. We had approximately $200 million of commercial paper outstanding as of June the 30, 2020, resulting in available capacity under our RCF at the 30th of June, of $1.3 billion. In addition, in May 2020, we established a GBP300 million commercial paper facility for our U.K. business. We did not issue commercial paper under this facility in the second quarter and therefore had no balance outstanding at quarter end. Unlike the U.S. commercial paper facility, this U.K. facility does not impact the capacity of the RCF. So, it adds an incremental GBP300 million borrowing capacity for our business. In June 2020, we entered in the amendment to our RCF which favorably revises the leverage ratio under the financial maintenance covenants for the next fiscal quarters starting with June 30, 2020.,  borrowing capability,  revolving credit facility,  commercial paper,  available\\ncapacity,  leverage ratio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Our near-term liquidity position was further improved by our Board\\'s decision in May to suspend our quarterly dividend for the remainder of the 2020 fiscal year, as well as the benefits of the capex and cost reductions discussed on our first quarter call. During the first quarter, we announced the reduction in 2020 planned capital expenditures by approximately $200 million and this reduction remains on target without sacrificing our ability to invest in necessary safety and maintenance projects, as well as capital investments that deliver cost savings and high return growth in these initiatives such as significant investments behind hard seltzer is in our Fort Worth brewery.,  near-term liquidity position,  quarterly dividend,  capex reductions,  cost savings,\\n safety and maintenance projects, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Amidst the backdrop of this global pandemic, we are pleased with our Q3 financial performance. Our progress in improving liquidity and efforts to advance our long-term goal for the business. While we are confident in our ability to achieve long-term success, we are mindful of the challenges and continued uncertainty that lie ahead. During this time of great uncertainty, our management and Board will continue to take prudent and proactive actions which are in the best interest of the company, our employees, consumers, customers and our stockholders. Our decisions will be guided by and consistent with the company\\'s overall financial discipline, ensuring adequate liquidity for our continued desire to maintain our investment grade rating. Our actions remain focused on doing what is [Technical Issues] by positioning the business for medium and long-term success.,  financial performance,  liquidity,  long-term goal,  prudent and proactive actions,\\n investment grade rating, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Greg Tierney, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations, Thank you Eric, and hello everybody.

And thanks to everybody for joining us this morning. It\\'s safe to say that the first quarter of 2020 was unlike any other in our company\\'s long history. We came out of a significant restructuring in Q4 of 2019 that was designed to free up resources to invest back in our business. In the early parts of Q1, we saw mounting confidence and enthusiasm for our plans and for our brands, internally and externally. But in late February that was interrupted by tragic shooting at our Milwaukee brewery and for the past few months, the entire global economy has been disrupted by the continued spread of coronavirus and the efforts to contain it.,  first quarter,  restructuring,  resources,  confidence,  brands, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, In a few short months, the landscape for all businesses has changed, not only for our industry, but for all of industry. And so necessarily the metrics by which we measure our business have also changed. What you will see today is that in the short term, we are making adjustments and no longer measuring ourselves against the five components of revitalization plan that we outlined for the past two quarters, which was a demonstration of how we were reapplying savings generated by the restructure. Rather we are looking at two overarching yet simple metrics. Firstly, taking the necessary steps to protect our employees and to mitigate the immediate business challenges of the coronavirus. And secondly, positioning our business to succeed in the medium and long-term as we enter a new normal. That\\'s the context we will discuss today.,  landscape,  industry,  metrics,  adjustments,  coronavirus, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, I do think it\\'s important to discuss what we are accomplishing before the pandemic hit in full force. Before the impact of coronavirus became widespread throughout North America and Europe, we were making progress against the revitalization plan. We continue to invest and maintain momentum with our iconic core brands, including continued positive share of segment trends for Miller Lite and Coors Light in January and February. This provides further evidence that our marketing campaign, It\\'s Miller Time and Made to Chill are resonating with new legal age drinkers. And in Europe, we ended February showing total volume growth and growth in our national champion brands including Carling.,  progress,  revitalization plan,  iconic core brands,  marketing campaign,  European\\nperformance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We were also seeing early positive signs around our big innovation bets in the above premium segment. In the US, Blue Moon LightSky and Saint Archer Gold both started the Europe strong. Per Nielsen for the four weeks ended April 11, they are both Top 10 brands in case share for new products launched nationally this year. And we recently launched Vizzy hard seltzer and Movo canned wine spritzers nationally, both of which are generating significant excitement from distributors and retailers. In Europe, we were grow above premium brands in February, with double-digit growth in our craft portfolio. And in Latin America, in February we were growing volume 18% versus the prior year.,  Blue Moon LightSky,  Saint Archer Gold,  Vizzy hard seltzer,  Movo canned wine\\nspritzers,  craft portfolio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also made progress on our organizational restructure. We recently finalized our European organization, which means our entire organizational structure is now set. We\\'re now focused on transitioning all work to the in state organization and we have been very successful in starting to generate the expected revitalization planned savings. Though in the short term, we are using these dollars to protect our cash and liquidity position, given the uncertainty in the economy.,  organizational restructure,  European organization,  work transition,  revitalization\\nplanned savings,  cash and liquidity position, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Despite the early progress in our revitalization plan, our Q1 results were disproportionately affected by two events. The first was coronavirus, which I\\'ll talk more about shortly. And the second was the horrific shooting at our Milwaukee brewery. While this may have been a passing tragedy for those outside the company, it impacted every employee in different ways. It changed the employee experience in our company forever and it materially impacted sales to wholesalers in late February and early March. The brewery was shutdown for an entire week and when it reopened it took a few days to get back to full capacity. This downtime effected shipment levels in March and together with the pantry load that took place during the last half of March, resulted in lower than planned distributor inventory at the end of the quarter. This was a major moment in the history of our company. We lost friends and colleagues, people lost the sense of security and the cultural issues that were raised following the shooting must be addressed, and they will be addressed. We\\'ve already conducted listening sessions with brewery and corporate employees and hired a new Director of Diversity Inclusion to ensure we have a robust D&I strategy that\\'s anchored in all areas of our business. And we will continue taking meaningful long-term actions to help build our culture and ensure we have a more diverse and inclusive workplace.,  coronavirus,  shooting at Milwaukee brewery,  employee experience,  sales to\\nwholesalers,  cultural issues, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, The second event that materially affected our Q1 results was coronavirus, a pandemic that has changed the world not just for our business and our industry, but for the entire global economy. Like everyone else. The full impact and what our new normal looks like going forward is still uncertain. The coronavirus has had and will have a material impact on our business. The financial impacts of coronavirus still very uncertain, we recently announced that we have withdrawn our financial outlook for 2020 and beyond. This remains true today, as we will not be providing financial guidance on this call. We will however provide additional data to help you better understand our business and how it could be impacted by coronavirus., Coronavirus, Q1 results, Financial outlook, Business impact, Uncertainty, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, As I mentioned earlier, the savings we continue to generate from our revitalization plan are being used to protect our cash and liquidity position. We expect a significant negative impact to revenue and profit, due to the closing of on-premise account around the world. In many instances the on-premise has been reduced to zero. To help give you a sense of how we\\'ve been impacted, based on 2019 numbers, approximately 17% of our North American NSR comes from the on-premise. Pantry loading did create a significant surge in off-premise sales in North America during the latter part of March across a number of our brands, benefiting our STR performance at the end of March. However, this pantry load is not continued into April, and while off-premise sales continue to perform well. We do not expect them to fully offset the loss of the on-premise volume., Revenue, Profit, On-premise, Off-premise, Cash and Liquidity Position, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, In Europe, based on 2019 numbers, the on-premise channel accounts for approximately 50% to 55% of NSR and it\\'s even higher in the United Kingdom, our most profitable European market where approximately 70% to 75% of NSR comes from the on-premise channel. While we are benefiting from some pantry loading and the shift of consumption to the off-premise, we expect the continued closure of the on-premise trade will have major implications for the performance of our European business in the second quarter in particular., On-premise, NSR, Europe, United Kingdom, Second Quarter, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, As I outlined earlier in the call, we are looking at two overarching yet simple metrics as we manage the impact from coronavirus. Firstly, taking the necessary steps to protect our employees and mitigate the immediate business challenges of the coronavirus and secondly, positioning our business to succeed in the medium and long-term as we enter a new normal. That is how we have approached decision making during the pandemic, and these two metrics will continue to guide our decision-making moving forward., Coronavirus, Metrics, Decision Making, Employees, Business Challenges, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, So when the crisis started, we took immediate steps to protect our employees, support our communities and ensure the continuity of our business. We implemented our crisis management and business continuity plans to guide decision making and our teams have led us through the series of steps we have already taken. We\\'ve implemented additional health and safety measures in our breweries and distribution centers, ensuring these federally and provincially designated essential operations can continue operating and we can protect our employees. We have stepped up cleaning and sanitization and hygiene and changed business practices to encourage social distancing. We instituted temperature screenings, provided cloth face masks and made hand sanitizer widely available for all employees who are continuing to work on the site., Coronavirus, Employees, Business Continuity Plans, Health and Safety Measures, Social Distancing, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, In North America, we created a new paid leave policy, adding up to 80 hours of paid leave to anyone who contracts the coronavirus or is forced to self quarantine can do so without losing pay or being forced to use their normally allotted sick leave. We are thanking our essential North American brewery employees with a pay incentive of $5 per hour for hourly employees and $200 per week for salaried employees who are continuing to work on site. And we created a voluntary paid leave program in North America, so any employee deemed by federal health authorities to be at high risk can receive paid leave of 60% of their regular wages. And we instituted an unpaid leave program for any employee who doesn\\'t feel safe coming to work., Coronavirus, Paid Leave Policy, Essential Employees, Pay Incentive, Voluntary Paid Leave Program,\\nUnpaid Leave Program, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We are also supporting our communities most impacted by coronavirus across North America and Europe. We are using marketing plans, charitable efforts and industry trade associations to support service professionals in on-premise locations. We are helping truck drivers across North America and homeless shelters in our communities, we\\'re providing them with fresh water. We\\'re also producing hand sanitizer to provide to our frontline employees and first responders in our local communities., Coronavirus, Communities, Marketing Plans, Charitable Efforts, Industry Trade Associations,\\nFrontline Employees, First Responders, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Consumer buying habits have changed significantly during the pandemic. And so, we\\'ve also taken steps across North America and Europe to shift how we are marketing our brands. We have prioritized and shifted media to platforms where we expect higher viewership like gaming, online video, and social media, while suspending on-premise activation and reducing or eliminating other platforms that have been impacted. We have also focused investments against our best-known brands to stay top of mind., Consumer Buying Habits, Marketing Strategies, Media Platforms, Brand Investments, On-Premise\\nActivation, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, With significant economic uncertainty, consumers are turning to big brands they trust. In fact since pantry loading began in mid-March in the United States, we are seeing industry share trends improved for both Coors Light and Miller Lite per Nielsen. Both brands are seeing better share trends in mid-March and both are growing segment share at an increasing rate. We will continue to meaningfully support these brands and look for ways to make them culturally relevant like we did with Miller Lite Virtual Tip Jar to support hospitality workers and Coors Light social activation with Olive, the 93-year-old Pennsylvania grandmother which generated over 2 billion pure impressions., Trust, Economic Uncertainty, Industry Share Trends, Brand Support, Cultural Relevance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We also have a diverse portfolio of products, including a strong economy segment. In the US, our economy segment, STRs and in particular the Keystone family of brands are performing well. We\\'ve always said that all segments matter and that has never been truer than today, as consumers see value in these difficult times., Economy Segment, Strong Economy Segment, Keystone Family of Brands, Consumer Value, Difficult\\nTimes, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clearly, this is a less than ideal time to launch new products and that is why we have delayed some of our new innovations and test and learn launches for the time being to ensure they are best positioned to succeed when they do hit shelves. However, we remain very optimistic about the brands that have launched recently in Vizzy hard seltzer, Blue Moon Light Sky, Saint Archer Gold and Movo canned wine spritzers. All of these brands have clear points of differentiation and are generating excitement from distributors and consumers., New Product Launches, Delayed Launches, Innovations, Test and Learn Launches, Brand\\nDifferentiation, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Beyond the products we have in the market, we are also adapting the way we get them to consumers by accelerating our e-commerce, if it\\'s subject to government regulations. We are partnering with a number of alcohol delivery platforms and other click and mortar retail sites to merchandise and make it easier to find our beers online. We are launching new e-commerce tools like a product locator for online purchases., E-commerce, Government Regulations, Alcohol Delivery Platforms, Click and Mortar Retail Sites,\\nProduct Locator, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We have also taken a number of financial actions to protect our balance sheet and put ourselves in the best position to weather the storm. We are reducing 2020 capital expenditures by approximately $200 million. We\\'re substantially reducing discretionary spending, limiting new hiring and have furloughed certain employees within Europe and our North American hospitality businesses. And we\\'re taking a hard look at all of our marketing investments and eliminating anything that will not deliver value in the current environment. We will continue to take additional financial actions if necessary and our desire is to maintain our investment grade rating., Financial Actions, Capital Expenditures, Discretionary Spending, Marketing Investments, Investment\\nGrade Rating, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, It may be cliche, but these are uncertain times for all industries. We will continue to navigate this challenging time by mitigating the short term risks and ensuring that we position the business to compete and win in the medium and long-term. So while we will continue to evaluate the situation and take all prudent and proactive actions that are in the best interest of the company in the medium and long term, we will not take actions that could have unintended consequences to our future success., Uncertain Times, Industries, Short-term Risks, Medium-term Positioning, Long-term Success, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now I\\'ll turn it over to Tracey for our Q1 financial results. Trace?, Financial Results, Q1, Tracey, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Gavin and hello everyone. I will first cover the quarter on a consolidated and regional basis, then move to our outlook., Consolidated Basis, Regional Basis, Outlook, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, With the uncertainty in the current environment, we will be giving additional forward visibility, including some April volume results and offering a perspective on how we believe we will be impacted by the coronavirus as we move forward. The April results are just one data points and represent only a portion of the second quarter, but do give some visibility to the impact that we\\'re seeing on our business now. We do not expect to continue to give this visibility on future calls., Uncertainty, Current Environment, Forward Visibility, April Volume Results, Coronavirus Impact, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, So to recap the quarter. Net sales revenue decreased 8.2% in constant currency. This decline was largely driven by our undershipment position in North America, coupled with the impact of the coronavirus across the entire business. These impacts include volume declines, estimated net sales returns and reimbursements of $31.5 million resulting mainly from the return of kegs related to the on-premise channel as well as unfavorable mix. These impacts were partially offset by higher global net pricing., Net Sales Revenue, Constant Currency, Undershipment Position, Coronavirus Impact, Volume Declines,\\nEstimated Net Sales Returns and Reimbursements, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis decreased 1.6% in constant currency, reflecting the impact of estimated net sales returns and reimbursements related to the on-premise impacts of the coronavirus as well as unfavorable mix, partially offset by positive pricing. While we continue to deliver positive pricing in the quarter, our mix was unfavorably impacted by the various market dynamics and consumer shift caused by the coronavirus. Specifically, the shutdown of on-premise locations as well as timing of when stay at home orders went into place across our various markets, had an adverse impact on geographic mix. And notably as many of our higher end products are skewed toward the on-premise, the closure of these establishments had an unfavorable impact on our brand mix., Net Sales Per Hectoliter, Brand Volume, Constant Currency, Estimated Net Sales Returns and\\nReimbursements, Unfavorable Mix, Positive Pricing, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Worldwide brand volume decreased 1.8%, driven by declines in Europe, while financial volume decreased 8.3% reflecting unfavorable shipment timing in the US and lower contract brewing volumes. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 3.3%, on a constant currency basis, driven by volume deleverage and inflation, partially offset by cost savings. Underlying MG&A decreased 2.2% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost savings and targeted spend reductions, partially offset by slight increase in marketing spend., Brand Volume, Financial Volume, COGS Per Hectoliter, Underlying MG&A, Marketing Spend, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 15.8% on constant currency basis. Underlying free cash flow, reflects the cash use of $216.6 million, which is $53.5 million favorable to prior year. Driven by favorable changes in working capital and lower interest payments, partially offset by lower underlying EBITDA and higher capital expenditures., Underlying EBITDA, Constant Currency Basis, Free Cash Flow, Working Capital, Interest Payments, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In North America, net sales revenue decreased 7.2% in constant currency. This decline was driven by unfavorable shipment timing in the US, including brewery downtime associated with the Milwaukee tragedy and lower contract brewing volume coupled with estimated net sales returns and reimbursement of $19 million, driven by our keg return program. We anticipate that the US undershipment position will largely reverse over the full year and expect the US shipment to outperform US brand volume trends in the second quarter., Unfavorable Shipment Timing, Milwaukee Tragedy, Unfavorable Mix, Keg Return Program, Undershipment\\nPosition, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, North American brand volume increased 0.4% benefiting from the timing of trading days this year as well as the March pantry loading in the US. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis decreased 1.3% in constant currency, driven by the on-premise sales returns and reimbursement as well as unfavorable geographic mix driven by increased license volume in Mexico, partially offset by net pricing growth. Underlying EBITDA decreased 11.9% in constant currency, due to lower financial volume and favorable mix and COGS inflation, partially offset by lower MG&A, cost savings in COGS and net pricing growth. The MG&A reduction was driven by cost savings related to the revitalization plan as well as cycling higher project costs in the prior year related to brewery systems implementations, partly offset by a slight increase in marketing spend around our new innovations that occurred early in the quarter, such as Blue Moon LightSky and Saint Archer Gold. This trend was in line with our initial plans for 2020 prior to actions taken to mitigate the impacts associated with the coronavirus., Net Sales Per Hectoliter, Brand Volume, Constant Currency, Unfavorable Mix, MG&A Reduction,\\nMarketing Spend, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In North America and particularly in the US, we benefited from pantry loading at the end of March that positively impacted our brand volume as sales to retailers in the US finished the quarter, reflecting improved trends from earlier in the quarter. In the four weeks ended April 24, 2020 in the US, STRs were down 14.1% driven by lower premium and above premium brand trends with the economy brand performance down 4.1% in the four weeks. We continue to see strong STR trends in off-premise, but these trends are not fully offsetting the virtual elimination of the on-premise sales. We expect the negative on-premise trends to continue, while social isolation continues to be practiced and expect that any increase in total off-premise volumes due to channel shifting will not be sufficient to offset the losses experienced in the on-premise. We estimate that this will result in negative trends in volume. NSR and mix versus our prior estimates and expect those trends to continue at least through the end of the year and in particular in the second quarter., Brand Volume, Net Sales Per Hectoliter, Off-Premise, On-Premise, STRs, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Turning to Europe, net sales on a reported basis decreased 13.4% in constant currency, due to lower volume, lower net sales per hectoliter, and sales returns related to the on-premise impacts resulting from the coronavirus. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis declined 5.2% in constant currency, driven by unfavorable geographic mix particularly due to the impact of the higher margin UK business, partially offset by net positive pricing. Financial volume decreased 10% and brand volumes decreased 8.5% as a result of the pandemic. Europe\\'s underlying EBITDA reflects a loss of $4.1 million compared to income of $13.5 million in the prior year, driven by gross margin impacts of volume declines and cost inflation, partially offset by lower MG&A expenses as a result of cost mitigation actions taken in response to the coronavirus pandemic., Europe, Net Sales Per Hectoliter, Brand Volume, Financial Volume, Underlying EBITDA, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In Europe, brand volumes were down more than 20% in March, driven by closures of on-premise accounts which began roughly a third of the way through the month. In the most recent four weeks, brand volumes are down approximately 40%. Our relative share position in Europe is significantly higher in the on-premise channel than in the off-premise. So we expect to be disproportionately impacted by the virtual shutdown of this channel and expect share losses during the shutdown period. In the off-premise, our capacity and staffing constraints will result in us not being able to meet the full demand of short-term channel shift. Based on 2019 results, on-premise business comprised approximately 50% to 55% of NSR. We are taking significant steps in reducing spending for both capital and expense and have taken steps around cash collections to minimize collection risks. Despite these actions a prolonged shutdown of the on-premise business, due to the coronavirus will have a meaningful impact on European and total company gross margin and profitability., Brand Volumes, On-Premise Channel, Off-Premise Channel, Gross Margin, Cash Collections, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, This takes me to our financial outlook. On March 27, we withdrew our guidance due to uncertainty, driven by the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic is impacting our business due to on-premise losses across the entire business and disproportionately in Europe. We expect an outcome of lower volume, negative mix and unfavorable fixed cost absorption in COGS, while the on-premise channel remain shutdown and slowly reopen, but the magnitude and duration of these impacts are still uncertain., Uncertainty, Coronavirus Pandemic, On-Premise Losses, Disproportionate Impact, Lower Volume, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Despite this risk, our continued desire is to maintain our investment grade rating and as Gavin mentioned, we are taking steps to ensure we protect our balance sheet and put ourselves in the best position to weather the storm. Given the uncertainty volatility and likely continued impact of the coronavirus, we continue to monitor and take proactive steps to ensure proper business continuity and adequate liquidity for our company. Therefore, we borrowed $750 million effective March 13 and another $250 million effective March 25 on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility for an aggregate draw of $1 billion as of the end of March 2020. As of April 30, we had paid back $400 million on the RCF, leading us with -- leaving us with an aggregate draw of $600 million and therefore an additional $900 million of capacity to draw. As we discussed earlier, we already have implemented a number of steps, including reducing our 2020 capital expenditures by approximately $200 million, substantially reducing discretionary spend, limiting new hiring, furloughing certain employees and significantly reducing marketing investments., Balance Sheet, Investment Grade Rating, Business Continuity, Liquidity, Capital Expenditures,\\nDiscretionary Spend, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In addition, we and our Board are actively evaluating various capital allocation options, including a suspension, reduction, or temporary elimination of our dividend. Obviously this is a very fluid situation as governments and companies evaluate the impacts of coronavirus and prepare for the reopening of the economy. Our management and our Board will continue to take prudent and proactive actions, which are in the best interest of the company, our employees, consumers, customers, and our stockholders as things become clearer in the rapidly evolving situation. Our decision will be guided by and consistent with the company\\'s overall financial discipline, ensuring adequate liquidity and our desire to maintain our investment grade rating., Capital Allocation Options, Dividend Suspension, Fluid Situation, Prudent Actions, Investment Grade\\nRating, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As we contemplate taking additional actions to navigate this unprecedented environment, we remain mindful of not taking any actions that would have unintended negative ramifications to our business or that would jeopardize our medium or long-term success., Unprecedented Environment, Additional Actions, Medium-Term Success, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2020, 1, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, So with that, thank you for your time and attention. And I\\'ll turn it back to Greg for Q&A. Eric?, Time, Attention, Q&A, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Greg Tierney, Investor Relations, All right, thank you, Andrea and hello everybody. So following prepared remarks from Gavin and Tracey, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and if you have more than one question, please ask your most pressing question first and then reenter the queue for a follow-up. To the extent that you have technical questions on the quarter, we ask that you pick them up with me in the days and weeks to follow., Thank You, Prepared Remarks, Questions, Technical Questions, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Greg Tierney, Investor Relations, Today\\'s discussion includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

And with that, over to you, Gavin., Forward-Looking Statements, Material Differences, GAAP Reconciliations, Financial Results,\\nComparable Prior Year Period, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Greg. Look 2019 was a challenging year for Molson Coors Beverage Company. However, despite significant headwinds and continued volume declines, we grew net sales revenue per hectoliter and improved our mix, we delivered strong free cash flow and cost savings, reduced our debt, sort of making progress toward premiumizing and modernizing our portfolio. We know we still got a lot of work to do, and that\\'s why, last quarter we announced a plan to get Molson Coors back to consistent top-line growth. Plan is designed to streamline the company, allow us to move faster and to free up resources to invest in our brands and capabilities. And as promised in October, we\\'ve wasted no time implementing the plan., Challenging Year, Net Sales Revenue, Mix, Free Cash Flow, Cost Savings, Debt Reduction, Top-Line\\nGrowth, Plan Implementation, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, To remind you, there are five components to the revitalization plan; investing in our iconic brands, aggressively growing our above-premium business in beer and in flavored beverages, growing beyond beer, strengthening our capabilities, and streamlining our company. So, let me update you on some of the progress that we\\'re making., Revitalization Plan, Iconic Brands, Above-Premium Business, Growing Beyond Beer, Capabilities,\\nCompany Streamlining, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We believe in the future of our core brands, that is they have the power to recruit new legal age drinkers which is why investing in our core is a key part of our revitalization plan. In the fourth quarter of 2019 in the United States, we released new creative pieces in the Coors Light Made to Chill campaign and the Miller Lite It\\'s Miller Time campaign, and we have already unveiled more spots in 2020 as well. The early results are positive., Investing in Core Brands, Revitalization Plan, Creative Pieces, Coors Light Campaign, Miller Lite\\nCampaign, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Additionally, global Coors Light performance was flat reflecting its best quarter in over three years and showing improvement in each of our segments. Miller Lite grew in all segments, delivering high double-digit growth in Canada and had its best quarter in the United States since 2014., Revitalization Plan, Core Brands, Global Coors Light Performance, Miller Lite Growth, Segments, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, As we work to aggressively grow our above premium business, we see progress in our above premium beer and in above premium flavored beverages. Volume in NSR improved for the full year 2019 in above premium with an acceleration in Q4. We will support this acceleration by providing more fuel to our fastest growing brands and new innovations in the above premium space., Above Premium Business, Volume Improvement, NSR, Acceleration, New Innovations, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Last month we launched new creative for Peroni in the United States, which grew strong double-digits in 2019 and presents a real opportunity for us in 2020. Belgian Moon continues to be one of our biggest success stories in Canada, growing strong double-digits in both the quarter and the year, and delivering its third consecutive year of growth. And Staropramen our Czech logo celebrated its 150th anniversary with volumes up high single-digits on the year with strong momentum heading into 2020 as Q4 volume and revenue grew double-digits., Peroni, Belgian Moon, Staropramen, Creative Launch, Volume Growth, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We have launched two big bid innovations in the United States already with Blue Moon LightSky and Saint Archer Gold. LightSky is a low-calorie, low-carb beer brewed with Tangerine pill. It\\'s a great product that pushes the Blue Moon brand into incremental occasions and consumers. Saint Archer Gold is a premium light logo that offers a better tasting alternative to Michelob Ultra as proven by independent expert beer panel. We introduced consumers to Saint Archer Gold with a broad media campaign that kicked off during the Professional Football Championship Game and showcases how the brand is the better tasting light beer., Innovations, Blue Moon LightSky, Saint Archer Gold, Media Campaign, Michelob Ultra, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our Black portfolio again outperformed the U.S. craft market in 2019 growing 16% per AC Nielsen versus a flat craft market. In January, we agreed to acquire Edgewater Brewery, a regional craft brewery in Michigan. It fills a geographic void, gives us distilled spirits capability and will help position our craft portfolio to continue outperforming the board across market., Black Portfolio, U.S. Craft Market, AC Nielsen, Edgewater Brewery, Geographical Void, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We are investing more in flavored malt beverage in large spaces that differentiate us and allow us to reach more consumers. Building on our 2019 successes in the United States, we will continue to invest behind Cape Line Sparkling Cocktails, which were Nielsen top-10 growth brand for 14 consecutive weeks in 2019. And we are expanding La Colombe Hard Coffee to additional markets., Investment, Flavored Malt Beverage, Cape Line Sparkling Cocktails, La Colombe Hard Coffee, Markets\\nExpansion, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, In Canada, we will continue to invest in Mad Jack, a popular F&B that was up double-digits on the year and next month we will launch Vizzy in the United States, a hard seltzer that offers differentiated ingredients, which would help it carve out a meaningful space in the seltzer category. And lastly, we\\'re expanding beyond the beer out all altogether. This is a big shift but it presents real growth opportunities., Mad Jack, Vizzy, Hard Seltzer, Beer Expansion, Growth Opportunities, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, In November, we announced an equity deal and long term partnership with L.A. Libations, an incubator of better-for-you non-alcoholic beverages. This investment essentially creates a new non-alcoholic innovation team for the Molson Coors Beverage. Something that we simply did not have before. Now I want to be clear, we are not looking to compete in the soda area with Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. Instead, we will be selective about where we compete, always looking to leverage our unique strengths. And of course, next month, we\\'re taking a definitive step into the wine category with the national launch of Movo Wine Spritzers in the United States., Non-Alcoholic Innovation Team, Equity Deal, Long Term Partnership, L.A. Libations, Better-For-You\\nBeverages, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, The organizational restructuring is well under way and we are making progress toward our goal of improving efficiency and unlocking an additional $150 million in annual savings bringing our total expected cost savings to $600 million over the 2020 through 2022 program. We have simplified our structure from four business units and a corporate center to two streamlined units, North America and Europe. In North America, our new organizational design is now set, all teams have been selected and people are transitioning to new office locations. In Europe, we have announced all senior leadership changes and anticipate completing the reorganization by the end of March. As part of our updated structure, we have a new data and analytics team and are expanding and developing new commercial and operational capabilities that will make us smarter and more efficient., Organizational Restructuring, Efficiency Improvement, Cost Savings, North America, Europe, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We continue to estimate the cost of all these changes will result in total one-time charges in the range of approximately $120 million to $180 million, spread over Q4 of last year, 2020 and 2021. Next quarter we will report our financials under our new operating structure.,  One-Time Charges,  Cost Estimation,  Operating Structure,  Financial Reporting,  Q4\\nand 2021, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, And as you can see, we are moving quickly to implement our plans and we\\'re starting to see glimpses of transformation within our portfolio. Also the new structure is really providing greater clarity and accountability. Teamwork has improved and the speed of decision making is substantially quicker. None of this is easy and it won\\'t happen overnight. But the tough decisions we\\'ve made and the quick actions and investments we are making will ensure the Molson Coors Beverage Company is bode to succeed in today\\'s marketplace., Moving Quickly, Implementing Plans, Transformation, New Structure, Clarity and Accountability, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, And now, I\\'m going to hand over to Tracey for a review of the fourth quarter and full-year, as well as our outlook. Tracey?,  Fourth Quarter,  Full Year,  Outlook,  Review,  Tracey, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Well, thank you, Gavin and hello everyone. I will first cover the quarter and full-year on a consolidated and regional basis and then move on to our outlook. So to recap the quarter, net sales revenue increased 3% in constant currency. We delivered positive global pricing and mix as well as a 1% increase in financial volume including a planned benefit in the U.S. from shipments exceeding brand volume as full year shipment volume and retail volumes converged.,  Net Sales Revenue,  Constant Currency,  Positive Global Pricing and Mix,  Financial\\nVolume,  U.S. Shipments, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 1.1% in constant currency, reflecting continued favorable global pricing and mix. Our Europe business continues to deliver strong NSR per hectoliter increases, driven by both pricing and mix. In North America, we saw a sequentially lower increase in our U.S. business and slightly lower rate in Canada. Remember, general price increases have largely shifted from the fall to the spring in the U.S. with the most recent increase last spring. Our U.S. mixed benefit was neutral in the quarter. Worldwide brand volume decreased 1% and financial volume increased 1% reflecting a planned benefit in the U.S., as we shipped largely to consumption for the full year.,  Net Sales Per Hectoliter,  Brand Volume,  Constant Currency,  Europe Business, \\nNorth America Business, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Global priority brand volume increased 1.6%. In the U.S. brand volumes benefited from improving industry volumes. October 2018 was soft following a general price increase and improving premium light segment trends as you heard in Gavin\\'s remarks. Canadian volumes remain challenged in the fourth quarter, driven in part by continued industry softness. In Europe, our brand volume benefited from a broad-based improvement in industry trends and continued premiumization., Brand Volume, Industry Volumes, Price Increase, Premium Light Segment, Canadian Volumes, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Our international business brand volumes grew double-digits, driven by strong performance in Latin America. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 1.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by inflation and mix and partially offset by cost savings. The trend was significantly improved versus prior quarters, primarily reflecting fixed cost absorption in our U.S. business resulting from shipment timing between quarters and the starting of one-time costs in our Canadian business from 2018., Brand Volume, International Business, Latin America, COGS Per Hectoliter, Cost Savings, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Underlying MG&A decreased 6.3% on a constant currency basis due to non-recurring vendor benefit in the U.S., and lower one-time incentive compensation expenses, driven by the anticipated departures as a result of the revitalization plan. These items together account for approximately 50% of the reduction in MG&A. Additionally, our marketing spend was lower in the fourth quarter, reflecting a planned shift of spending to support brand launches earlier in the year and align our marketing pressure with the key selling seasons, particularly within Europe and the U.S., MG&A, Vendor Benefit, One-Time Incentive Compensation Expenses, Marketing Spend, Brand Launches, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As a result, underlying EBITDA increased 15.8% on a constant currency basis. Recapping the year, net sales revenue decreased 0.6% in constant currency. We delivered positive global pricing and mix, but this was offset by a decline in global volume. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 2.9% in constant currency, driven by favorable pricing and mix as we continue to focus on premiumizing our portfolio. Worldwide brand volume decreased 3.5% and financial volume decreased 4%. Global priority brand volume decreased 2.2%. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased mid single-digits at 4.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by inflation, mix and volume deleverage, partially offset by cost savings. Underlying MG&A decreased 0.9% on a constant currency basis, corporate underlying MG&A was $158 million coming in below prior year and below our prior estimate, driven largely by lower incentive compensation expense and other targeted spending reductions., Brand Volume, Net Sales Revenue, Pricing And Mix, COGS Per Hectoliter, MG&A, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Marketing spend per hectoliter was up for the year in each of our segments. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 2.6% on a constant currency basis. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $827 million, in line with prior results but below our prior estimates, driven by later and lower than planned capital expenditures. Net interest expense of $273 million was in line with our third quarter estimate. We delivered underlying free cash flow of $1.370 million in line with our estimates and 3.7% below the prior year driven by lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash tax payments, partially offset by lower capital expenditures, favorable changes in working capital and lower cash interest payment., Marketing Spend Per Hectoliter, Underlying EBITDA, Depreciation And Amortization Expenses, Net\\nInterest Expense, Underlying Free Cash Flow, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Capital expenditures of $593 million were lower than our prior estimate driven by savings and the timing of capital spending as we evaluated and made capital decisions to drive stronger returns. In 2019, we completed our three-year savings program associated with the MillerCoors acquisition and integration delivering $230 million during 2019 and bringing our three-year total savings to $725 million. Cost to capture the savings over the three years were $208 million coming in at the low end of our most recent estimate of $230 million, driven by the addition and delivery of high-value low-cost project. This takes me to our financial outlook., Capital Expenditures, MillerCoors Acquisition And Integration, Savings Program, Cost To Capture\\nSavings, Financial Outlook, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We expect 2020 to be a transition year and anticipate net sales revenue to be flat to down low-single digits on a constant currency basis. We expect underlying EBITDA to be down high single-digits on a constant currency basis from fiscal year 2019 underlying EBITDA of $2.364 billion. Our estimated underlying effective tax rate is 20% to 24%. We expect interest expense of $280 million plus or minus 5% and we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $850 million. We estimate capital spending of $700 million plus or minus 10% and underlying free cash flow of $1.1 billion plus or minus 10%, reflecting lower expected EBITDA performance as well as higher cash taxes than in 2019., Net Sales Revenue, Underlying EBITDA, Effective Tax Rate, Interest Expense, Depreciation And\\nAmortization Expense, Capital Spending, Underlying Free Cash Flow, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, And as mentioned on our Q3 earnings call, we increased our total cost savings program for the period 2020 to 2022 to $600 million as a result of the revitalization plan to be spread more or less evenly over that period. As a reminder, we are planning to reinvest these additional cost savings behind our brands, and as a capability building. With the exception of costs that would qualify for special items treatment, all other costs to achieve the $600 million in savings are included within our underlying EBITDA guidance. Examples of special items included in the $120 million to $180 million of cost to achieve are severance, retention and relocation costs associated with the revitalization plan. Accelerated depreciation and other direct costs associated with the Irwindale Brewery closure will also be reported as special items. We expect 2021 and thereafter to deliver net sales revenue and underlying EBITDA growth versus 2020. We intend to maintain our investment grade credit rating and as our full year 2019 trailing annual underlying EBITDA has our current annualized dividend within our target range of 20% to 25%, we do not anticipate the Board of Directors will change our dividend rate at this time. The change in structure to two business units went into effect at the start of the year. Therefore, the resulting financial reporting changes will be reflected in our first quarter 2020 results, including allocation of corporate MG&A expense to our two business segments. And also please consider the following related items. Our estimate of 2020 EBITDA is unchanged versus our estimates on October 30, 2019 in spite of a strong fourth quarter benefiting from one-time items, shipment timing and deferred spending as we refined our revitalization plan. Our business continues to face a number of headwinds, including inflation and we are committed to investing to improve our top-line performance. While we expect the full year\\'s underlying EBITDA to be down high single-digits on a constant currency basis, we expect the second half EBITDA to be better than the first half for two main reasons. Our full-year increase in marketing investments will begin in half one as we launch new products and add support to our premium brands and the cost savings that we expect to realize in 2020 will be skewed to the back half of that year., Cost Savings Program, Revitalization Plan, Investment Grade Credit Rating, Dividend Rate, Financial\\nReporting Changes, EBITDA Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 4, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In January, we announced the decision to close our Irwindale brewery. The associated cost savings are not considered part of the revitalization plan but are included in the previously announced $600 million cost savings program for 2020 to 2022. Now with that, thank you for your time and attention and I\\'ll turn it back to Andrea for Q&A., Brand Volume, Net Sales Revenue, Pricing And Mix, COGS Per Hectoliter, MG&A, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Mark David Swartzberg, Vice President of Investor Relations, Thank you Steve and hello everyone. Following prepared remarks from Gavin and Tracey we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We expect you will have various questions on the revitalization plan we announced this morning. To the extent that you have technical questions on the quarter we ask that you take them up with me in the days and weeks that follow.

K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thank you Mark and hello and welcome everybody. I\\'d like to first frame the revitalization plan we included in the slides we filed with the SEC and announced to our employees early this morning and which I will review in more depth after Tracey\\'s remarks. We are one of the world\\'s leading brewers and own a tremendous portfolio of brands but we\\'re over-indexed in declining segments. Our core brands have seen years of volume losses and our marketing spend and innovation capabilities haven\\'t kept up with the competition. Our business is at an inflection point. We can continue down the path we\\'ve been on for several years or we can make the significant and difficult changes necessary to get back on track., Revitalization Plan, Brands, Volume Losses, Marketing Spend, Innovation Capabilities, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our revitalization plan is designed to streamline the company to move faster and to free up resources to invest in our brands and our capabilities. And through it we will create a brighter future for Molson Coors. The plan aims to revitalize Molson Coors achieving consistent top line growth by enabling us to invest in iconic brands as well as opportunities to grow in the above-premium space; expand beyond beer without having to sacrifice support for larger brands in the company\\'s portfolio; and to create new digital competencies for commercial functions systems capabilities for the supply chain and new capabilities for employees. To make this possible we plan to unlock resources by eliminating duplication shedding what\\'s not working and restructuring the organization to better succeed in today\\'s competitive fast-paced environment., Revitalization Plan, Streamlining, Resource Unlocking, Brands, Digital Competence, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now I\\'ll review this plan with you shortly. But first over to you Tracey for Q3 results., Brand Volume, Net Sales Revenue, Pricing And Mix, COGS Per Hectoliter, MG&A, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks Tracy. I look forward to speaking with you quarterly to discuss our financial results. But today I want to focus on our revitalization plan and deliver better results than we have in recent years. Our company makes some of the world\\'s greatest beers and our iconic brands have withstood the test of time. But as the world around us rapidly changes and the nature of competition intensifies our business performance is lagging. I\\'m sure all of you are well aware of that. That is why we\\'re implementing a revitalization plan that includes meaningful change for Molson Coors to unlock significant resources that we can invest back into the company putting more resources behind our brands premiumizing and modernizing our portfolio and building new capabilities. The good news is that as a major brewer with a rich portfolio of iconic brands across key categories we have the scale and the cash flow to improve top line growth., Revitalization Plan, Brands, Performance, Resources, Growth, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We have the capabilities to succeed. And while the market joins us in our attention to the top line our financial performance demonstrates our commitment to strong financial discipline through robust cash flow balance sheet strength and returning cash to shareholders. So why do we need a revitalization plan? All of you know the dynamics we face and we recognize where we have the opportunity to improve to increase our exposure to growth segments bigger and faster innovations and a more simplified and streamlined organization. And what\\'s more in the past few years our competitors have significantly stepped up their marketing spend and innovation capabilities relative to ours keep pace with the changing marketplace. And as such we must invest more if we expect to drive long-term sustainable success. There are 5 components in our plan to revitalize Molson Coors. We\\'re going to invest in our iconic brands. We\\'re going to aggressively grow our above-premium business. We are going to expand in adjacencies and beyond beer. We will increase our investment in marketing and commercial capabilities and all of that will be enabled by streamlining our company resulting in a more effective organization with additional fuel to fund our investments., Revitalization Plan, Financial Performance, Competition, Investment, Organization, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, As I walk through the plan I will also highlight how things will be different than before. We have shown we can improve the performance of our iconic brands and can stabilize brand performance and position for sustainable growth by accelerating investments behind our largest brands; by focusing on recruitment especially of new legal-age drinking consumers; by driving relevance with breakthrough marketing; and by innovating on core brands to attract new legal-age drinkers. We\\'re seeing what\\'s possible right now with Coors Light in the United States. Now I understand it\\'s still very early but the highly acclaimed Coors Light Made to Chill campaign that launched in the U.S. is already showing positive results. Brand is suddenly part of pop culture again with new partnerships as a topic on late night TV shows and even as a favorite of the Jonas Brothers. So much so that in the past few months brand has generated more than 2 billion PR impressions. And today after struggling for years in the U.S. Coors Light is finally gaining segment share and seeing volume improvement under the new campaign. And our plan is to put more resources behind breakthrough marketing like this., Revitalization Plan, Brands, Performance, Marketing, Innovation, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, It\\'s a model for breaking through the noise of your usual big beer ads that we hope to replicate with the new Miller ad campaign in the U.S. that just launched during the World Series last week. The brand is redefining the iconic Miller Time slogan for a new generation of legal-age drinkers connecting them to Miller Lite in a fresh way that we haven\\'t done before. These are very different new campaigns for 2 of our biggest brands. And under our revitalization plan we can execute big campaigns for our iconic brands without having to sacrifice our efforts to premiumize and modernize our portfolio. Now you know we\\'re not happy with our above-premium performance but we\\'re not without our successes. In Europe we have successfully transformed our portfolio over the last few years and are now sourcing more than 30% of our volume from above-premium brands including increasing strength for start-up Pravha. In the U.S. this quarter represented Blue Moon\\'s best quarter since 2017 and Peroni is growing strongly on the strength of the brand and its first national media campaign of the year. And in Canada Belgian Moon is continuing its great run up 40% year-to-date., Revitalization Plan, Brands, Performance, Marketing, Portfolio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our revitalization plan is intended to give us the resources we need to aggressively build on those above-premium success stories with our existing brands with new innovations and potentially through new bolt-on acquisitions and investments for our portfolio. This means more money to market big ideas like Saint Archer Gold Blue Moon Light Sky and Coors Peak in the U.S. and Coors/Molson Ultra in Canada. It also means enhancing our ability to bring new beverages to the market more quickly and with more precision. We will expand the model that has reduced the time it takes to bring our innovations to market to as little as 4 months in the U.S. We will also expand the test-and-learn approach that lets us determine market potential for products and then quickly scale up like we are with Movo and Saint Archer Gold in the United States. Going forward we plan to innovate test and scale products faster than we ever have before. We also expect to be able to invest more in whitespace and beyond beer opportunities., Revitalization Plan, Resources, Brands, Innovation, Portfolio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, This will give us the ability to invest in the continued growth of recent successes like Carling Black Fruits Draft in Europe. We\\'re taking Movo white wine spritzers our first-ever canned wine national in the U.S. We also expect it will allow us to fuel an even stronger second year of Cape Line and a stronger third year of Arnold Palmer Spiked in the U.S. which we plan to rapidly scale. And we need to do more. Our pipeline includes the recent introductions of La Colombe Hard Coffee in the U.S. Pip & Wild Premium ciders in the U.K. Vizzy Hard Seltzer in the U.S. which we plan to launch early next year. And Truss\\'s new line of cannabis-infused nonalcoholic beverages in Canada including the recently announced Flow Glow\\'s CBD-infused spring water. You will see us push into these whitespaces faster than we ever have in the past. Our revitalization plan depends upon our competing and winning on the foundation of our great beers. It also means we must extend beyond the beer aisle. And so beginning January 1 2020 our corporate name will be Molson Coors Beverage Company., Revitalization Plan, Brands, Performance, Resources, Growth, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, While this is a simple change the name speaks volumes about who we are and what is possible for our business. We will also invest in expanding in key capabilities. That will mean improving our digital competencies expanding our data resources and building out our innovation systems. It will also mean investing in tangible plans to build a more diverse and inclusive organization and to support growth opportunities for our people. We also plan to invest several hundred million dollars to modernize our brewery in Golden Colorado. This previously planned investment will modernize the brewery to allow for more flexibility enabling us to move with pace and deliver new products to meet changing consumer preferences., Revitalization Plan, Investment, Organization, Digital Competence, Data Resources,\\nModernization, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, The company is not using the cost savings generated from this revitalization plan to make this brewery investment possible. Those of you keeping models you see we are upping our 3-year cost savings plan to $600 million from $450 million but the reorganization driving that is much more than a new cost savings program. It comes with a difficult decision to consolidate and reorganize office locations and eliminate a number of positions. It means a streamlined organization as we are moving from a corporate center and 4 business units to 2 business units: North America and Europe. Our North American business unit will combine the United States Canada and our corporate center giving us consolidated leadership teams and enabling us to move much more quickly with an integrated portfolio strategy. The Europe business unit will be structured to allow for stand-alone operations developed and supported by a European-based team including a regional leadership team in commercial and support functions., Revitalization Plan, Cost Savings, Organization, Consolidation, Reorganization, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our International business provides important growth opportunities but the existing Molson Coors International team will be reconstituted to more effectively grow our global brands. The International business in the Americas will become part of the North American business unit while the International business in Africa and Asia will become part of the Europe business unit. It also means a revised leadership team including Tracey as CFO; Simon Cox as President and CEO of Molson Coors Europe; and Michelle St. Jacques as Chief Marketing Officer. We won\\'t have a president of the U.S. business; rather a significant portion of my job will be dedicated to ensuring our success in our North American business unit. We currently estimate the cost of all these changes will result in total onetime costs in the range of approximately $120 million to $180 million of the balance of this year 2020 and 2021. Once the transition is complete our organization will look and act dramatically different than it has in the past., Revitalization Plan, Cost Savings, Organization, Leadership, Change, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, And we fully expect to be better positioned to compete in today\\'s fast-paced competitive market which takes us to our financial outlook. We expect 2020 to be a transition year and anticipate net sales revenue to be flat to down low single digits on a constant currency basis. We expect EBITDA to be down mid-single digits off the base of the last 12 months trailing underlying EBITDA of $2.289 billion on a constant currency basis. We estimate underlying free cash flow of $1.1 billion plus or minus 10% including higher cash taxes than in 2019 and an additional capital spending to support growth. And we are upsizing our expected cost savings from $450 million to $600 million for the period 2020 through 2022 to be spread more or less evenly over that period., Revitalization Plan, Financial Outlook, Cost Savings, EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, We expect 2021 and thereafter to deliver net sales revenue and EBITDA growth versus 2020 while delivering the remainder of the $150 million in added cost savings. We intend to maintain our investment-grade rating and there is no change to our dividend payout objective. Change in structure to 2 business units will not be effective until January 2020 and therefore the resulting financial reporting changes will not be reflected until our first quarter 2020 results. This is a lot of change but we will execute it efficiently because we cannot wait and risk allowing the competition to continue passing us by to outspend us to out-innovate us and to out-maneuver us. We will move faster and free up resources. We will invest in our brands and our capabilities. We will regain the success of our past and we will create a brighter future for the Molson Coors Beverage Company. So thank you for your time and attention., Revitalization Plan, Financial Outlook, Cost Savings, Investment Grade Rating, Dividend\\nPayout Objective, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Gavin D. K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, And with that I\\'ll turn it back to Steven for Q&A., Revitalization Plan, Financial Outlook, Cost Savings, Investment Grade Rating, Dividend\\nPayout Objective, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, So thank you Gavin and hello everyone. I will speak first to the quarter on a consolidated and regional basis and then to our 2019 outlook. So to recap the quarter our net sales revenue decreased 2% in constant currency. We delivered strong pricing in each business unit and positive global mix but this was more than offset by volume declines. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3% in constant currency. And worldwide brand volume decreased 2.4% and financial volume decreased 5.5%. Global priority brand volume decreased 2.2%. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 5.9% on a constant currency basis driven by inflation and volume deleverage partially offset by cost savings. Underlying SG&A decreased 2.2% on a constant currency basis driven by slightly lower marketing spend and lower incentive compensation partially offset by cycling a net benefit from the amicable resolution of a vendor dispute. However marketing spend per hectoliter was up in the quarter and year-to-date. As a result underlying EBITDA decreased 5.6% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date underlying free cash flow was $884.8 million 13.7% below the prior year driven by lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash tax payments partially offset by lower capital expenditures and lower cash interest payments. Moving to our business units. In the U.S. net sales revenue decreased 2.3% driven by a 6.2% decline in shipments to wholesalers excluding contract brewing. This was partially offset by positive net pricing and mix. The shipment decrease was driven by 2 factors., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, First we cycled last year\\'s networkwide inventory bolt to support our Trenton and Fort Worth Brewery go-lives which resulted in very strong STWs in the third quarter of prior year. Second brand volumes declined 3.9% on a trading day-adjusted basis in the quarter. COGS per hectoliter increased 6.6% driven by inflation volume deleverage and other factors including a substantial and anticipated increase in property tax at our Golden brewery partially offset by cost savings. MG&A increased 3.3% driven by cycling a net benefit from the amicable resolution of a vendor dispute in a prior year partially offset by the incremental cost reductions related to the restructuring program initiated in the third quarter of 2018. Marketing investment per hectoliter remains higher year-to-date compared to prior year. As a result underlying EBITDA decreased 8.6%. In Europe net sales revenue increased 1.7% on a constant currency basis driven by positive pricing and mix offsetting a slight decline in brand volume. COGS per hectoliter increased 3.5% in constant currency due to inflation. MG&A decreased 1.7% in constant currency driven by lower incentive compensation expense offsetting higher marketing investment focused on our national champion brands and premiumization initiatives., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, EBITDA, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Marketing spend per hectoliter was up in the quarter and year-to-date. As a result underlying EBITDA increased 0.6% in constant currency. In Canada net sales revenue decreased 4.9% on a constant currency basis driven by a 5.1% decline in brand volume partly due to industry softness partially offset by positive pricing. COGS per hectoliter increased 9.7% in constant currency primarily driven by volume deleverage cycling prior year distribution gains brewery start-up costs and inflation with a partial offset from cost savings. MG&A decreased 7.7% in constant currency driven by timing shifts of higher marketing investment in Q2 as well as lower incentive compensation partially offset by Truss joint venture start-up costs. As a result underlying EBITDA decreased 12.3% in constant currency. In addition during the quarter we identified a goodwill impairment triggering event due to prolonged weakness in industry performance impacting our long-range expected cash flows. Consequently a charge of $668.3 million was recorded to specials in the Canada-U.S. GAAP results., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, EBITDA, Goodwill Impairment, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Also note we estimate Truss-related start-up costs of CAD 10 million to CAD 15 million in 2019. In our International business net sales revenue decreased 15.5% on a constant currency basis driven by an 8.6% decline in brand volume and negative geographic mix partially offset by price increases. COGS per hectoliter increased 6.1% in constant currency driven by geographic mix and inflation. MG&A decreased 29% in constant currency driven by lower marketing spend and incentive compensation expense. As a result we delivered $7.7 million of underlying EBITDA resulting in a 190% increase on a constant currency basis. Moving to our 2019 outlook. Our earnings release details our guidance. In terms of cost savings we continue to expect a total of $700 million of savings for the three years ending 2019. And Gavin will speak to upsizing of our previously communicated $450 million to $600 million for the period 2020 through 2022 to be spread evenly over that period. The additional $150 million of savings is before onetime cost to achieve and will help fund additional investments. We continue to expect 2019 consolidated underlying COGS per hectoliter to increase at a mid-single-digit rate on a constant currency basis. We now expect 2019 consolidated interest expense of $275 million plus or minus 5%., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, EBITDA, Goodwill Impairment, Guidance, Investments, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 3, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We expect 2019 capital spending of $700 million plus or minus 10%. We expect 2019 underlying G&A of approximately $850 million. We continue to estimate underlying free cash flow of $1.4 billion plus or minus 10% this year. And finally before I hand the call back to Gavin a comment regarding the remainder of the year. We continue to expect a ship to consumption in the U.S. on a full year basis and therefore expect fourth quarter year-on-year change in shipments to exceed fourth quarter year-on-year change in brand volume., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark Swartzberg, Vice President of Investor Relations, Thank you, Gary, and hello everyone.

With me on the call this morning are Tracey Joubert, the CEOs of our business units; Lee Reichert our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer ; and Brian Tabolt our Global Controller., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, Now, before we begin, I\\'m sure you all saw the press release earlier this morning announcing my retirement on September 27th. Privileged to serve as the Molson Coors CEO for the past five years and I thoroughly enjoyed engaging with our investors and analysts throughout our journey. This leadership change has been worked through with our Board as part of our ongoing succession planning at the executive level., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, I\\'m genuinely excited about the future for Molson Coors and proud of what we\\'ve accomplished over the past five years. Our goal with the acquisition of MillerCoors and the Miller international business was to create a bigger and better Company. In 2015 and 2016 we plan for an executed on the step change and transformed our scale. From 2017 till today we\\'ve delivered on the integration and the short[Phonetic] deleverage and synergy commitments made at the time of acquisition. Despite higher inflation and softer industry demand than anticipated. Along the way we\\'ve also strengthened our culture with introduction of our first choice ambition and both the leadership and capabilities of our people through our commercial excellence and world class supply chain programs., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, As we now shift the emphasis to greater focus on top line growth while remaining financially disciplined. It\\'s an appropriate time for me to pass the baton onto Gavin to lead the Company through our next chapter of continuing to energize, premiumizing and modernize our portfolio and to move beyond beer with disruptive thinking. And you\\'re already seeing some of the fruits of this work., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, And while I\\'m happy to be able to move on to my next phase after a 36-year career and spend more time with my family in the UK, along with the rest of the Board, I\\'m also very excited to see Gavin take over the reins and help successfully drive the Company forward in its next chapter., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, Gavin has been on the Executive team for the past seven years and is well known to many of you as a former Molson Coors Global CFO and as the leader of our U.S. business unit for the past four years, he knows our business, he know you, and he shares my absolute passion for our people, our brands and our success. And our time today is focused on earnings. So for the balance of the call today, Tracey and I will take you through highlights of our second quarter 2019 results for our Company, along with some perspective on the second half of 2019, and the related slides can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, After a solid start in the first four months of the year May and June were challenging reflecting unfavorable weather and weak industry demand across our major geographies, resulting in a disappointing volume performance in the quarter. Despite this backdrop, we executed our plans for incremental brand investment to drive accelerated portfolio premiumization and innovation impact across our business., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, Encouragingly we delivered strong constant currency net sales per hectoliter growth of 3.7% and our share trends improved in the U.S. and were stable in Europe. We also saw a strong Premium Light share growth in the U.S. as Miller Lite and Coors Light each gained segment share. And this was ahead of the newly launched Coors Light made to chill advertising, which is focused on new drinker recruitment by traumatizing Coors Light purpose to refresh the spirit with Mountain cold refreshment credentials., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, We believe this creative platform is distinctive, disruptive and breakthrough. We also, through the quarter maintained our focus on cash flow through ongoing cost savings, productivity improvements and improving our working capital., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, We remain resolute on the ambition to improve our top line through increased investments in our brands, portfolio premiumization and innovation initiatives, including the launch of our Truss cannabis, infused non-alcoholic beverage portfolio in Canada later this year. We\\'re committed to doing this while maintaining our investment grade credit rating and strengthening our quarterly dividend, which increased by 39% to $0.57 per share in line with our target of 20% to 25% of prior fiscal year, underlying EBITDA and is payable for the first time in September., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, As you know, our first choice strategy has three major components focused on top-line, bottom-line and use of cash, allowing us to improve shareholder returns. And more is focused on improving top-line growth, I mean, all top-line performance can improve. Encouragingly the quarter showed a disciplined pricing across our brands and regions, positive global mix improved share trends in the U.S., maintenance of share in Europe are focused on reshaping and premiumizing our portfolio and a readiness to spend against this focus., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, Our use last discipline is demonstrated by enterprise productivity and cost savings initiatives, all of which remain on track. This includes our work in Canada where we have begun Brewing trials in our new British Columbia brewery and recently completed the sale of our Montreal property, and they are in the early stages of building a state of the art brewery in Longueuil Quebec., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, I\\'m pleased with our progress monetizing and modernizing our brewery footprint in Canada and expect significant benefits from the upgrades we are making to our network, including more flexible capacity to meet demand, lower unit operating costs and increased supply chain efficiency. Please remember that the one-off start-up costs for the new brewery in British Columbia impacted the Q2 results in Canada. The more broadly in relation to using less and as former Coors Brewing Chairman Bill Coors once said, waste is a resource that\\'s out of place, Molson Coors help pioneer the recyclable aluminum camera revolution 60 years ago. And this year, we\\'re stepping up our efforts to tackle the global plastic waste crisis., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, Over the next two weeks, we will launch our beer print report 2019 outlining the progress made against the 2025 sustainability goals . With the release of the report, we will also launch a set of additional ambitious commitments to minimize the impact of our packaging alongside the great work that\\'s already under way across our responsibility, sustainability and inclusiveness agenda., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, And finally alongside earning more and using less we continue to invest wisely. As you saw in the quarter, we are investing more behind our commercial agenda, increasing marketing and sales spend on a per hectoliter basis and in absolute dollars in the quarter in first half., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, You should look for us to increase spending against attractive consumer segments and brands without sacrificing our deleverage and cash return objectives. Another words, we intend to use multiple tools to deliver improving top line performance, namely higher return commercial spend, targeted increases in brand investment and innovation and a more effective supply chain and minimizing out of stocks. In terms of deleverage, we recently completed the sale of our Montreal brewery for CAD126 million providing us with additional funds for debt pay down. And on July 15th, we repaid $500 million of senior notes through a combination of cash, and new commercial paper. And we expect to continue to deleverage thereby maintaining and strengthening our investment grade credit rating., Revenue, Pricing, Volume, Cost Savings, Guidance, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, Thanks, Tracey. Now as you know, our focus depends upon extraordinary brands, customer excellence and disruptive growth. So looking at our brands. We continue to realize strong pricing across our business units, giving us more fuel for brand investment, which is increasing to energize our core brands premiumized and modernize our portfolio. In terms of our core brands, as I mentioned within the U.S. we saw strong Premium Light share growth and we expect this to accelerate where our new Coors Light advertising has just launched, and more on that in a second. In terms of premiumization, global mix became positive as a result of our performance in Europe and through package mix -- unbilled package mix in the U.S. trended unfavorably, this was partially offset by brand mix which was positive for the first time in the U.S. since early 2018. Drivers of our premiumization progress included Staropramen and Pravha in Europe, Belgian Moon in Canada and Cape Line, Blue Moon Belgian White, Peroni, Henry\\'s Heart Sparkling, Arnold Palmer Spiked half and half and the Sol trademark in the U.S., Brand growth, pricing, core brands, premiumization, advertising, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, We also expect bolt-on M&A to continue to hit premiumization. And in Europe, we recently completed the purchases of Pardubicky Pivovar in the Czech Republic and Hop Stuff Brewery in London. Our global brands benefited from yet more strong performance from Blue Moon and Belgium Moon in Canada, Europe and International. The Staropramen in Europe and Miller Lite in our international and Canada business is growing strongly., Brand growth, M&A, premiumization, global brands, Blue Moon, Staropramen, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, And in terms of reshaping our portfolio, we\\'re demanding more from innovation and Hard Seltzer, we\\'re committed to building on the performance Tracey mentioned, I think offerings in the segment, reflecting our confidence in the Henry\\'s brand and the Hard Seltzer segment., Innovation, Hard Seltzer, portfolio reshaping, Henry\\'s brand, segment confidence, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, Now of course Coors Light is our largest brand and though we are pleased to see it\\'s Premium Light segment share improve in our largest market that\\'s simply not enough., Brand growth, premiumization, core brands, advertising, M&A, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors, Our new creative started running this week, and Gavin, Michelle, our US distributors and I are excited about made to chill, which is focused on new drink recruitment by dramatizing Coors Light\\'s purpose to refresh the spirit through its mountain cold refreshment credentials.

I will speak first to the quarter on a consolidated and regional basis, then to our 2019 outlook and finally to our capital allocation plan. So to recap the quarter, our net sales revenue decreased 2.9% in constant currency, although we delivered strong passing in each business units as well as improving global mix, this is more than offset by volume declines. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.7% in constant currency. Our worldwide brand volume decreased 5.6% and financial volume decreased 7%. Our global priority brand volume decreased 4.6%. Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by inflation, volume deleverage and increased packaging costs associated with our U.S. bottle furnace rebuild, partially offset by cost savings., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Underlying MG&A increased 5.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by increased brand investment and starting of G&A benefits from the prior year. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 12.8% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date underlying free cash flow was $560.7 million, 15% below the prior year driven by lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash tax payments, partially offset by lower capital expenditures and lower cash interest payments., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Now moving to our business units. In the U.S. overall industry demand was softer year-on-year, and net sales revenue decreased 2.9% driven by 6.7% decline in sales to wholesalers excluding contract brewing, partially offset by net price increases., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Cost per hectoliter increased 4.7% driven by inflation, volume deleverage and increased packaging costs associated with our bottle furnace rebuild, partially offset by cost savings. MG&A increased 4.5% reflecting higher marketing investment focused on our above premium and innovation brands as well as cycling lower employee incentive expense in the prior year, partially offset by the incremental cost reductions related to the restructuring program initiated in the third quarter of 2018., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 8.2%. In the second quarter, we took share in premium lights with Coors Light returning to segment fee growth and Miller Lite gaining segment share for the 19th consecutive quarter and also holding industry share. Our above premium portfolio has a number of fast-growing brands, including Peroni, Sol, Arnold Palmer Spiked half and half, and Henry\\'s Heart Sparkling, which grew strongly and gained share of FMBs, according to Nielsen. This growth was more than offset by declines from Leinenkugel Shandy family and Redd\\'s franchise. Blue Moon Belgian White had a big quarterly volume performance since the fourth quarter of 2017 holding industry shares and Cape Line, our new Sparkling Cocktail offering has been a top 10 growth brand to Nielsen since early June., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In Europe, net sales revenue decreased 2.4% on a constant currency basis, due to 6.5% decline in brand volume, partially offset by strong price increases, and favorable mix. COGS per hectoliter increased 7.5% in constant currency, primarily driven by station and volume deleverage. MG&A increased 8.7% in constant currency, reflecting higher overall marketing investment focused on our national champion brand and premiumization initiatives as well as starting last year\\'s partial reversal of bad debt provisions., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 18.4% in constant currency. And we knew we were facing challenging comparisons due to the 2018 World Cup and exceptional summer with the last year and yet the quarter is still disappointing driven by unfavorable weather and softer market demand. We remain confident in our ability to drive balance net sales revenue growth through our strategy of investing behind our national champion brands and accelerating our premium portfolio. Despite soft demand, this strategy is resulting in net sales per hectoliter growth of 4.3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter and protection of our market share., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In Canada, net sales revenue decreased 2.9% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by 5.1% decline in brand volume primarily due to softness in industry volume, partially offset by positive pricing., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, COGS per hectoliter increased 7.6% in constant currency driven by inflation and increased distribution costs and favorable sales mix, volume deleverage and brewing start-up costs in British Columbia, partially offset by cost savings., Inflation, distribution costs, sales mix, volume deleverage, brewing start-up costs, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, MG&A increased 9.5% in constant currency driven by higher overall marketing investments focused on Coors Light and Molson Canadian programing, our premiumization efforts and modernization of our portfolio through innovation as well as Truss start-up costs., Truss, MG&A, marketing investments, premiumization, modernization, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 25.4% in constant currency.

Also note we continue to estimate Truss related start-up costs of CAD10 million to CAD15 million in 2019., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In our international business, net sales revenue decreased 12.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by an 11.9% decline in brand volume along with the shift to local production in Mexico. This was partially offset by price increases and a positive geography shift. COGS per hectoliter increased 7.8% in constant currency, driven by inflation and sales mix changes. MG&A decreased 5.3% in constant currency, driven by lower overhead costs, partially offset by higher marketing investments behind our focus brand. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 10.8% on a constant currency basis to $5.8 million., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Brand volume decline due to higher net pricing on Coors Light in Mexico and supply chain constraints, related to the general election in India, partially offset by double-digit growth in several of our focus markets, including Argentina, Panama and Puerto Rico. Coors Light volume was down principally because of Mexico, while Miller Lite volume increased mid-single digits across all of our international markets., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, And moving to outlook, our earnings release details our guidance. We continue to expect 2019 consolidated underlying COGS per hectoliter to increase at a mid-single digit rates on a constant currency basis. In terms of cost savings, we continue to expect a total of $700 million of savings for the three years ending 2019 and planned and added $450 million for the period 2020 through 2022 to be spread evenly over the period., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, These savings will help fund our investment plans. The cost of achieving the savings and offset input inflation. We continue to expect our international business to deliver underlying EBITDA growth of strong double-digits in constant currency for 2019 versus 2018. And we continue to estimate underlying free cash flow of $1.4 billion plus or minus 10% this year., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, And finally, before I hand the call back to Mark. A few comments regarding our recently announced dividend increase modeling and our approach to brand support., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Our next quarterly dividend declared at $0.57 per share is payable September 13 and brings out dividend in line with our target of 20% to 25% of prior fiscal year, underlying EBITDA. We ended the second quarter with normal levels of inventory and shift to consumption on a year-to-date basis., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Recall that claims [Indecipherable] last year lead to very strong STWs in the third quarter contributing to very soft STWs in the fourth quarter. We have two remaining system go live in Albany, Georgia and Irwindale, California. And these remain on track to complete them by year-end. The inventory both will be limited within these brewery orbit. So for the balance of the year, we expect to shift to consumption and anticipate prior-year comparisons will lead to high STW trained in the fourth quarter and the third quarter., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Our third quarter will also reflect the letting of the favorable resolution of U.S. being the dispute, which was more than half of the MGA favorability in the third quarter of last year. And we will also be letting Canada distribution gains within COGS in the third quarter of last year., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 2, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Finally, North American industry conditions remain challenging and will continue to spend our dollars efficiency, while also increasing spending against the tractor consumer statements and brand.

With me on the call this morning are Tracey Joubert, our CFO; the CEOs of our business units; Lee Reichert, our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; and Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller. Today, Tracey and I will take you through our plans to drive long-term total shareholder returns, discussing our first quarter results and outlook. And as usual, related slides can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Our first quarter was solid, delivering on our commitment to improving top line performance while also protecting the bottom line., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Even with industry volume pressure in North America and the shift of Easter from Q1 to Q2, revenue was up on a constant currency basis driven by strong and disciplined net sales revenue per hectoliter growth across our business, ongoing portfolio of premiumization and improving share trends in our largest market. While only the first and the smallest of our quarters, I am encouraged by the meaningful growth of net sales revenue in the U.S., led by the increasingly strong performance of Miller Lite, which held total beer industry share and an improved performance of Coors Light in our largest and most profitable market as well as strong U.S. retailer placements for our up-weighted innovation program. We also saw a continuing strong net sales revenue growth in Europe, our second largest business unit., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Across Molson Coors, I\\'m pleased with the continuing acceleration of our portfolio of premiumization efforts alongside our intensified innovation program and the growth in our underlying EBITDA, which despite higher inflation, grew on a constant currency basis. Now as you know, our First Choice strategy has 3 major components: focus on top line, bottom line and the use of cash, allowing us to improve our long and short-term shareholder returns. And more is focused on improving top line growth and we\\'re advancing in multiple fronts. We\\'re realizing strong pricing across brands and regions, giving us more fuel to invest for growth. Our 2 largest brands improved their volume trends in our largest market, resulting in better STRs for our U.S. business. Global priority brands were a key driver of our consolidated net revenue increase, a strong net sales per hectoliter gains more than offset volume softness., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our above premium mix continue to improve with Peroni, Sol, Henry\\'s Hard Sparkling and Arnold Palmer Spiked growing very rapidly in the U.S.; Blue Moon growing rapidly outside of the U.S.; and Staropramen continuing its strong growth across Europe. We continue to win in retail with additional placements flowing through in Q1 and more significantly in Q2. And we\\'re advancing an up-weighted innovation program from accelerating the development of Clearly Kombucha and the full national launch of Cape Line and Sol Chelada in the U.S., the Coors Slice, Aquarelle and Bella Amari in Canada and the Pravha in the U.K., plus multiple rapid incubation initiatives such as in Archer Gold, La Colombe hard coffee and Hydra, and the readiness for launch of more disruptive initiatives such as Truss, our Canada-focused cannabis beverage JV less discipline is demonstrated by more than $200 million of expected cost savings in 2019 and our expectation of another $450 million of cost savings over the period 2020 to 2022., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Underlying these commitments are several enterprise productivity and capability driving initiatives, namely World Class Supply Chain 2.0; global business services, which is now scaled to over 500 people in Romania; IT consolidation and procurement savings from multiple sources. All remain on track and include development of our 2 greenfield breweries in Canada, including our British Columbia brewery, which is on plan to begin brewing in the third quarter. And we\\'re investing wisely. We reduced our debt by more than $2 billion since closing the MillerCoors transaction and our Board\\'s intention remains to reinstitute a dividend payout ratio in the range of 20% to 25% of annual trailing underlying EBITDA for the second half of 2019 and ongoing thereafter. And we\\'re taking advantage of opportunities to invest more, buying their commercial agenda to drive our revenue performance while also increasing our commitment to attractive returns on every marketing dollar., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tracey. Our revenue focus, or earn more, is one of the 3 platforms by which we drive total shareholder returns, and this depends upon extraordinary brands, customer excellence and disruptive growth. Looking at our brands, our commitment to energizing our core brands is paying off. As I mentioned, in our largest market, Coors Light trends improved with our brands regaining positive segment share momentum. And Miller Lite continues taking segment share while also holding share of the total U.S. beer market. We\\'re also further intensifying our focus on premiumization. Highlights of the quarter include strong double-digit or even stronger brand volume growth for Arnold Palmer Spiked, Sol, Henry\\'s Hard Sparkling and Peroni in the U.S. and upper single-digit growth for Coors Light in the U.K. while we drive the national rollout of Pravha Staropramen. And our global brands remain a priority., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller Lite, Coors Light, Coors Banquet, Blue Moon and Staropramen, each of the household name in its own market and each can become bigger, thanks to our multinational reach. Miller Lite\\'s Staropramen and Blue Moon are great examples. Brand volume of Miller Lite grew strong double digits in our international business in the quarter. Staropramen brand volume grew 15.8%, including growth in the Czech Republic, and Blue Moon and Belgium Moon brand volume grew strong double digits in each of international, Europe and Canada in the quarter. Continuous development of our customer excellence capability also remains a focus and is evident across our business. We continue to be a leader in category management in the U.S. as evidenced by a first place result overall in the most recent annual Advantage survey and the first place on-premise result in the most recent annual CM Profit Group survey., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Retailers trust those to grow the size and value of their beer category and we consistently outperform our competition in this area. In Europe, customers rate us with a leading Net Promoter Score of 60-plus in a majority of the countries in which we operate. And our U.K. business was again ranked #1 by on-premise GN accounts. In Canada, we continue to help customers drive category growth. For example, a major retailer has seen improving beer category growth in stores where we reset beer shelves and joint brewer retailer teams are applying our success to other major chains., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, We\\'re also improving our intensity buying innovation and disruptive growth. Our stepped up innovation approach is demonstrated by the introduction of Cape Line and Archer Gold and Sol Chelada in the U.S., contributing to more than 180,000 expected placements for our new and year 2 products in 2019. In Canada, Coors Slice, Aquarelle, hard seltzer and Bella Amari are rolling out, and Truss remains on track to be a first mover when cannabis-infused beverages are planned to be legalized in October of this year. In international, our portfolio is benefiting not only from Miller Lite\\'s strength, but also from continued expansion of Blue Moon, which is now available in 20 international markets., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, And finally, we\\'re delivering new services and revenue streams through upgrading our digital and e-commerce capabilities in Europe and beyond. Concluding on pack and driving shareholder value, we plan to increase cash returns through an increased dividend later this year. We remain committed to our investment-grade status and our balanced approach to capital allocation. I look forward to intensifying our top line revenue opportunities in front of us through our first choice for consumer and customer agenda. Thanks for your time and attention., Truss, portfolio, occasions, CEO, team, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. I will speak first to the quarter on a consolidated and regional basis, then to our cost savings and 2019 outlook and finally, to our capital allocation plan.

Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Underlying MG&A decreased on a constant currency basis driven by lower G&A. As a result, underlying EBITDA increased 0.2% on a constant currency basis. Underlying free cash flow was a use of $270.1 million, an increase in cash used of $75 million from the prior year\\'s first quarter primarily due to unfavorable timing of working capital partially offset by lower cash paid for interest and capital expenditures. Moving to our business units. In the U.S., net sales revenue increased 0.7%, driven by price increases partially offset by 2.7% decline in sales-to-wholesalers excluding contract brewing. Our COGS per hectoliter increased 5.9%, driven by higher commodity and transportation costs, increased packaging costs associated with our U.S. bottle furnace rebuild and volume deleverage, partially offset by cost savings., Underlying MG&A, underlying EBITDA, free cash flow, business units, COGS per hectoliter, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Tracey I.

Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As the company\\'s top priority, Coors Light continued its progress following its rollout of new creations late in Q4 with new on-premise content and partnerships. We posted significant growth in a number of brands within the above premium segment, including Henry\\'s Hard Sparkling, Peroni, Sol and Arnold Palmer Spiked.

In Europe, net sales revenue increased 4.4% on a constant currency basis, driven by price increases and favorable mix partially offset by 2.3% brand volume decline. COGS per hectoliter increased 3.7% in constant currency, driven by commodity inflation.

Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As a result, underlying EBITDA increased 2% in constant currency. Continued momentum in 2019 was evidenced by top line growth, driven by 8.2% increase in net sales per hectoliter on a constant currency basis, more than offsetting the volume, which was impacted by our planned declines in our low-margin value brand as we increase our focus on our national champion brands and above premium portfolio. In Canada, net sales revenue decreased 3.4% in constant currency driven by 6% decline in brand volume due to soft Canadian industry volume, which we estimate to be kind of approximately 5%, partially offset by cost increases. COGS per hectoliter increased 6.3% in constant currency driven by volume deleverage, increased distribution costs and cost inflation, partially offset by cost savings. MG&A decreased 1.1% in constant currency driven by timing of employee-related expenses partially offset by higher investment to support the rebranding of our Molson brands and Truss-related costs., EBITDA, top line growth, net sales per hectoliter, COGS per hectoliter, MG&A, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Tracey I.

In terms of brands, strong growth from Belgium Moon and Miller High Life partially offset softness in our core brand. for the Molson trademark also improved during the quarter following initiation of the brand relaunch. Also note, we estimate Truss-related start-up costs of CAD 10 million to CAD 15 million in 2019. In international, net sales revenue decreased 14.4% on a constant currency basis driven by 6.7% decline in brand volume and favorable geographic mix and the shift of local production in Mexico partially offset by price increases., EBITDA, underlying EBITDA, brands, core brand, Molson trademark, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Tracey I.

As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased to $2.7 million. Brand volume declined as a result of balancing higher pricing with lower volume in Mexico. The shift of Easter to Q2 and cycling a strong post-hurricane result in Puerto Rico, and this was partially offset by growth in several of our focus markets such as Chile, Paraguay and Honduras. Coors Light\\'s volume was down principally because of the ongoing focus on brand equity growth versus promotional volume growth in Mexico, partially offset by strong double-digit increase for Miller Lite. Now moving to outlook. Our earnings release details our guidance., COGS per hectoliter, MG&A, underlying EBITDA, brand volume, Coors Light, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Tracey I.

In terms of cost savings, we continue to expect a total of $700 million of savings for the 3 years ending 2019 and plan an added $450 million for the period 2020 through 2022. We expect procurements and supply chain, including brewery optimization, to constitute the majority of these new savings with RC and global business services also contributing to the $450 million. We expect these savings to be spread evenly over the period of 2020 through 2022 to help fund our internal investment plan, the cost of achieving the savings and offset input inflation., EBITDA margin expansion, consolidated underlying cost per hectoliter, cost savings, procurements\\nand supply chain, brewery optimization, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2019, 1, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We expect our international business to deliver underlying EBITDA growth of strong double digit in constant currency for the full year 2019 versus 2018. We estimate underlying free cash flow of $1.4 billion plus or minus 10% this year. Now as you contemplate full year 2019, keep in mind that we recently rescheduled our Albany brewery system implementation from Q1 to post this selling season, which will impact STW saving. We expect increased packaging cost associated with our U.S. bottle furnished reboot to moderate this fall and we intend to incrementally support our brand building initiatives for the rest of the year., EBITDA growth, underlying free cash flow, Albany brewery system implementation, STW saving,\\npackaging cost, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark Swartzberg, Vice President of Investor Relations, Thank you, Gary, and good morning everyone.

Just a bit of housekeeping, we look forward to meeting with many of you over the course of the year and various corporate access events are scheduled for the year. I also want you to know we plan to host an Investor event similar to the one held historically in June every two to three years. Between such meetings, we plan to continue our many other forms of corporate access, including headquarter visits, field trips, non-deal roadshows, and broker conferences. I wanted to take care of that housekeeping item. And I think Gary, if you\\'re ready, we\\'ll open the line to questions., 1. Housekeeping, 2. Meetings, 3. Investor event, 4. Corporate access, 5.

With me this morning are Tracey Joubert, the CEOs of each of our business units; Lee Reichert, our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer, and Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller. Today, Tracey and I will take you through our plans to drive long-term shareholder returns, highlighting our fourth quarter and full year results and discussing our outlook for the business. And you can also find related slides on Investor Relations page of our website., 1. Shareholder returns, 2. Results, 3. Outlook, 4. Business, 5. Website, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, We accomplished much in 2018. We delivered strong free cash flow, and we met our deleverage commitments. We restored underlying EBITDA growth in the quarter and the second half, and we continue to premiumize our portfolio across our regions, including launching Truss, our Canadian cannabis beverage JV, scaling volume and profitability in our fast-growing international business, and continuing to strengthen our European business., EBITDA growth, free cash flow, deleverage commitments, portfolio premiumization, Truss, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Through the year, we further scaled our cost saving program, which insulated us in part from the effects of weaker industry demand in North America, higher-than-anticipated inflationary pressures, and challenges associated with the implementation of our US brewery supply chain system., Cost saving program, industry demand, inflationary pressures, US brewery supply chain system, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, We entered 2019 with the US commercial plan focused on mix and share improvement that\\'s fully resourced and showing early signs of impact against Coors Light, a commercial strategy that\\'s working in Europe and International, and continually improving commercial trends in Canada. We are focused on further strong free cash flow delivery and deleverage supported by more than $200 million of cost savings in 2019 and a further $450 million of cost savings across 2020 to 2022., Mix and share improvement, commercial strategy, free cash flow delivery, deleverage, cost savings, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, We remain committed to our plan to reinstitute a dividend payout ratio in the range of 20% to 25% of annual trailing underlying EBITDA upon achieving around 3.75 leverage, which we expect to occur around the middle of 2019. Against this backdrop of progress and commitments, let me share more about what you can expect from our strategy of earning more, using less and investing wisely before handing the call to Tracey to elaborate on the quarter, the year and our outlook., 2. Dividend payout ratio, 3. Leverage, 4. Earnings, 5. Investment, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In terms of earning more, we will continue to build even stronger commercial excellence capability with a focus on portfolio premiumization and disruptive growth to drive mix improvements. Almost 20% of our volume is comprised of Above Premium brands, and this figure continues to grow, and we see considerable headroom for added growth in all of our markets., 1.

Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In International, we enter 2019 with an optimum cost structure, improved brand profitability, and a portfolio of Above Premium brands, gaining strength in our focus markets. In Europe, our strategy of strengthening our core national champion brands while premiumizing the portfolio is well developed and working. In Canada, industry trends have been challenging, but our total share trend has improved three quarters in a row, and pricing continued to show positive improvement. We will continue to improve Coors Light share trends while premiumizing the portfolio and preparing for the launch of our Truss portfolio., cost structure, brand profitability, Above Premium brands, focus markets, pricing, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the US, while we were dissatisfied with the 2018 top line and share performance, we also believe we have the strategy, people and commercial execution to drive improving performance in 2019 and the longer term. We anticipate further contraction of the US beer industry volumes, which we plan to offset by adding resources to accelerate our portfolio premiumization and improve our industry volume share trends.,  strategy,  people,  commercial execution,  portfolio premiumization,  industry\\nvolume share trends, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Using less is our second platform and is designed to fuel growth and protect our bottom line performance. We are over-delivering on our original cost savings plans for 2017 through 2019, allowing us to offset inflation and protect marketing investment, and as Tracey will cover, we expect to unlock another $450 million of savings over the period 2020 through 2022. These savings are driven by our sustainable productivity driving initiatives such as World Class Supply Chain 2.0, our greenfield breweries in Canada, Global Business Services, new IT programs and our ongoing procurement efforts and more rigorous ZBB across the entirety of our business., cost savings, sustainable productivity, World Class Supply Chain 2.0, greenfield breweries, Global\\nBusiness Services, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Investing wisely is our third platform, and you know our commitment to deleverage and increase cash returns. Similarly, we are committed to spending our marketing dollars more effectively than ever by scaling investment behind accelerated portfolio premiumization and through the full adoption of our ROMI approach and increasing sophistication of our investment planning. I also want to highlight that our spending is often understated by third-party aggregators, reflecting our shift of increasing amounts to digital and experiential platforms., investing wisely, deleverage, cash returns, ROMI approach, digital platforms, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tracey. Earning more is one of the three platforms by which we drive PACC, and this pillar is built on our First Choice commercial excellence approach. I\\'d like to give you some evidence of that by region, followed by a few comments on the increasing potential of our enterprise growth actions. In the US, Miller Lite continues its strong segment trend, while Coors Light\\'s relative performance improved with the brand holding share of segment in Q4.,  commercial excellence,  First Choice,  regional performance,  enterprise growth\\nactions,  Miller Lite and Coors Light, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In 2019, we have plans to accelerate our Above Premium portfolio through higher investment. We plan to double our media spend on Blue Moon, the Number 1 national craft brand, air national advertising for Peroni for the first time, build on a very successful year one for both Arnold Palmer Spiked and Sol. We\\'ll also increase Henry\\'s Sparkling presence in the fast-growing hard seltzer category, focusing on the brand\\'s clear product differentiators of zero sugar and only 88 calories, and introduce a number of innovations, including Cape Line, Saint Archer Gold, Crispin extensions and Sol Chelada, all before this summer., Blue Moon, Peroni, Arnold Palmer Spiked, Henry\\'s Sparkling, Cape Line, Saint Archer Gold, Crispin\\nextensions, Sol Chelada, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our US business enters 2019 having further strengthened its position as the trusted category captain across chain accounts in both the off and on premise. And more broadly, our customer excellence performance is market leading and improving further, as evidenced by the Advantage Survey results. And allied to this, we have ramped up our e-commerce approach within joint business plans and continue to build competitive advantage through our technology enabled field sales teams with tools such as BeerMate, which we are now rolling out globally. We are also thrilled to welcome Michelle St. Jacques as the new Chief Marketing Officer and Brian Erhardt, as our new Chief Integrated Supply Chain Officer for the US business.,  trusted category captain,  customer excellence performance,  e-commerce approach, \\ntechnology enabled field sales teams,  new CMO and CISCO, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our new Coors Light advertising is now on air, and we know we are moving in the right direction with the brand, allowing us to take even more share in Premium Lights. Coors Light will continue to emphasize its cold Rocky Mountain positioning as the World\\'s Most Refreshing Beer. It will also invest more than ever on digital and social channels to engage and recruit 21 to 34-year-old drinkers., Coors Light, Premium Lights, cold Rocky Mountain positioning, digital channels, social channels, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R.

Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In Europe, we continue to move in the right direction. Our brand volumes are growing and premiumizing. Our National Champion portfolio inflected to positive volume growth last year, our global brands continued to grow well in excess of the industry, and our Above Premium and craft portfolio also contributed to growth and mix.,  brand volumes,  premiumizing,  National Champion portfolio,  global brands,  Above\\nPremium and craft portfolio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R.

Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, We are delighted our National Champion brands in Europe had such a solid year, and we still aim for more. Our largest brand, Carling, has just begun a major new 360-degree campaign called Made Local, which started this month, and continue through 2019 and continue to strengthen the brand\\'s market-leading position.,  National Champion brands,  solid year,  360-degree campaign,  Made Local,  market-\\nleading position, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, in Europe, we are exporting and licensing our brands to multiple new markets. We are generating increasing profit from this business and are excited about its future because it\\'s low capital intensity and offers considerable room for growth.,  exporting,  licensing,  new markets,  profit,  low capital intensity, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our First Choice commercial excellence approach and capability is building in Canada too. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of commercial performance, there are multiple highlights. Our total share trend has improved three quarters in a row, and Coors Light\\'s segment share also improved three quarters in a row, improving to flat in the fourth quarter. Craft volume grew driven by Belgian Moon and Creemore, and our non-alcoholic portfolio of Coors Edge and Heineken 0.0 is delivering strong volume and segment share growth.,  commercial excellence,  total share trend,  segment share,  craft volume,  non-\\nalcoholic portfolio, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the value segment, we delivered strong share growth driven by our simplified portfolio strategy and the launch of Miller High Life. As we look at 2019 and beyond, we are excited by the potential we see from our innovation pipeline. Coors Slice, for example, is an innovation that strengthens the Coors trademark, and we are encouraged by the tests behind our pending introduction of Aquarelle, our hard sparkling water.,  simplified portfolio strategy,  Miller High Life,  innovation pipeline,  Coors Slice,\\n Aquarelle, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our commitment to customer excellence includes the adoption of BeerMate to strengthen field sales management and promising joint business plan pilots with key customers. For example, a pilot with Ontario\\'s LCBO is producing beer category growth well in excess of the total industry performance.,  customer excellence,  BeerMate,  field sales management,  joint business plan,  key\\ncustomers, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our two largest brands will benefit from new advertising, brand redesign, and innovation in 2019. For Coors Light, we launch our new The Mountains Are Calling campaign and introduce new packages, including a new chill pack in time for summer, and the Molson trademark enters 2019 with a new brand redesign and communication platform expected to unlock latent passion for the brand.,  new advertising,  brand redesign,  innovation,  The Mountains Are Calling campaign,\\n new packages, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, The Miller trademark returned to our portfolio in 2016, and we plan to build on a very successful 2018, building awareness and distribution of Miller High Life -- excuse me, since its launch early last year and adding to the success of MGD in other non-US markets by expanding the brand\\'s availability and above premium positioning.,  Miller trademark,  building awareness,  distribution,  Miller High Life,  MGD, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R. Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, As you know, the MillerCoors transaction also gave us the opportunity to get bigger internationally.

Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our Global Brands span many markets and still have enormous potential. Coors Light continues to show very strong volume growth in Europe and is contributing to an improvement in region profits in Mexico, where we reduced promotional intensity. Miller Lite is responding positively to the change to its original white packaging in over 20 markets, and MGD and Miller High Life are showing significant growth outside of their home markets from LatAm to Europe to India.,  Global Brands,  volume growth,  market expansion,  promotional intensity,  original\\nwhite packaging, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R.

We continue to reenergize our core brands expanding to new occasions, including low and no alcohol. We also continue to expand the footprint of our portfolio into new and emerging segments such as sparkling cocktails and hard sparkling water. Additionally, we have a range of initiatives such as Truss, which we expect to launch its non-alcoholic cannabis infused beverages portfolio in the fall of 2019 following legalization in Canada, the expansion of Blue Moon Tap Rooms and our entry into markets such as Kombucha. All of these initiatives are underpinned by continuous investment in our brewing capability and R&D.,  low and no alcohol,  sparkling cocktails,  hard sparkling water,  non-alcoholic\\ncannabis infused beverages,  brewing capability and R&D, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Mark R.

And with that, I\\'ll turn it back to Mark.,  time,  attention,  turn back,  Mark, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Mark, and hello everybody. Before I share consolidated and regional financial highlights, I would like to remind you of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, effective from the beginning of 2018, which we will refer to as revenue recognition for the remainder of the prepared remarks today. As outlined in our earnings release, revenue recognition had no significant impact to net income for the full year, but did cause some timing differences between quarters, positively impacting EPS by $0.04 this quarter and impacting some year-over-year comparability for net sales and MG&A, primarily in the US and Canada this quarter. Please refer to our SEC filings for more detail.,  revenue recognition accounting standard,  net income,  EPS,  year-over-year\\ncomparability,  SEC filings, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Separately, you may have noticed that we filed an 8-K this morning, indicating that we restated our 2016 and 2017 financial statements for a technical income tax accounting matter related to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of MillerCoors in 2016 and subsequent remeasurement of deferred taxes in 2017 resulting from the recent US Tax reform. These restatements did not have an impact on our reported underlying pre-tax income, underlying earnings per share or underlying free cash flows for 2016 and 2017 as these issues related to items that we previously excluded.,  technical income tax accounting matter,  acquisition of MillerCoors,  restatements, \\nUS Tax reform,  underlying pre-tax income, underlying earnings per share or underlying free cash\\nflows, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Further, such corrections do not impact our anticipated future cash tax benefits resulting from acquisition, future effective tax rates or are otherwise indicative of the underlying performance of the business. Please refer to our SEC filings for more detail.,  future cash tax benefits,  future effective tax rates,  underlying performance of the\\nbusiness,  SEC filings, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, I will speak to the quarter and year on a consolidated and regional basis and also our outlook. We continued to see some of the same pressures in the fourth quarter as we did during the first three quarters of the year, mainly industry declines in North America, as well as inflation in the US. Our fourth quarter results were also impacted by the timing of inventory levels in the US, which drove a further reduction in our financial volumes over brand volume. However, these metrics largely converged for the full year.,  industry declines,  inflation,  timing of inventory levels,  financial volumes, \\nbrand volume, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, While these negative factors had an unfavorable impact on our top line results for the quarter, we exercised flexibility and discipline in the P&L, and as a result, delivered underlying EBITDA growth of 3.9% on a constant currency basis. This was driven by positive global net pricing, brand volume growth and underlying business performance in Europe and International, cost savings and cost mitigations, as well as reductions in our MG&A expenses., EBITDA, P&L, top line, quarter, international, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, The full year results were impacted by the same factors, and were further adversely impacted by cycling the indirect tax reserve reversal in Europe, which drove the decrease in underlying EBITDA of 1.5% on a constant currency basis., EBITDA, full year, Europe, indirect tax reserve, cycling, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In the US, we grew underlying EBITDA 6.4% in the quarter driven by lower MG&A expenses, higher net pricing and favorable impact of the new revenue recognition standard, partially offset by lower volumes, cost inflation and negative sales mix. Lower MG&A expenses were due to spending optimization and efficiencies, as well as lower employee-related expenses including incremental cost reductions related to the restructuring initiated in the third quarter and lower employee incentive expenses. Overall, US brand volumes declined 5.1% on a trading-day-adjusted basis for the quarter and domestic sales to wholesalers declined 8.9%, in part due to quarterly timing of wholesaler inventories which ended 2018 at normal levels of inventory., EBITDA, MG&A expenses, net pricing, revenue recognition standard, brand volumes, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In the quarter, our brand volumes remained below industry trends. However, we made progress with our top priority, Coors Light, as the brand reversed its negative segment share trend and launched its new marketing campaign near the end of the quarter, reintroducing our cold-activated packaging to a whole new generation of legal-aged drinkers. Miller Lite increased share of Premium Lights for the 17th consecutive quarter, while holding total beer industry share, according to Nielsen. Above Premium performed below our expectations, but we are excited about our 2019 plans to accelerate premiumization of the portfolio., Brand volumes, Coors Light, marketing campaign, Miller Lite, Premium Lights, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Our full year US underlying EBITDA decreased 1.5%, driven by lower volumes, higher COGS as a result of higher transportation costs, aluminum inflation and volume deleverage, as well as negative sales mix, partially offset by lower MG&A expenses and higher net pricing. However, we delivered high-single-digit underlying EBITDA growth in the second half due to improved sales to wholesaler trends, our accelerated NSR per hectoliter growth in the fourth quarter, and the incremental cost reduction initiatives we executed. On a full-year basis, brand volume and STWs largely converged as brand volume declined 3.9% and STWs declined 4.4%., EBITDA, volumes, COGS, sales mix, MG&A expenses, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, For the year, we gained market share within the Premium Light segment, while our Economy brands gained segment share and held share of total beer industry, according to Nielsen. In Above Premium, we established a foundation for growth by successfully introducing Arnold Palmer Spiked, established Peroni as the fastest growing European import, and relaunched the Sol brand, while our Regional Craft brand growth continued to far outpace that of the craft segment., Premium Light, Economy brands, Above Premium, Arnold Palmer Spiked, Peroni, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In Europe, underlying EBITDA decreased 7.8% in local currency in the quarter. And this was due to lapping last year\\'s partial release of a bad debt provision and the adoption of revised industry guidelines for calculating excise tax in one of our major European markets. We also continued to invest in our First Choice Agenda during the quarter, aiding further growth in our volume and brand mix. Brand volume increased 3.3%, reflecting improved performance of our Global, Above Premium and National Champion Brand portfolios. We have also continued to expand the reach of our business geographically through our European Export and License team, improving PACC and increasing our absolute volume, royalty income and profit, although this does dilute our NSR per hectoliter. Our European export and license business now represents approximately 8% of our Europe brand volume, and we expect its strong growth to continue., EBITDA, bad debt provision, excise tax, First Choice Agenda, brand volume, PACC, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Full year underlying EBITDA in Europe decreased 8.2% in local currency primarily due to the reversal of the indirect tax provision in 2017, but was up 4.3% excluding the effect of this reversal. Our European business grew brand volume 2.2% as well as improved its brand mix. Global Brands, Above Premium and National Champion brand portfolios all grew and more than offset losses in the value category as we executed our strategy to premiumize our portfolio. We also expanded our portfolio through the acquisition of the Aspall Cyder brand portfolio and are currently performing ahead of our acquisition business case. We also continued our disciplined approach toward optimizing marketing investment and cost control., EBITDA, brand volume, brand mix, value category, acquisition, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In Q4, our Canada underlying EBITDA decreased 12% in local currency, driven by lower volumes, negative sales mix, one-time supply chain inventory write-offs, and inflation, partially offset by cost savings and a 2.7% increase in net sales per hectoliter in local currency before revenue recognition. MG&A, excluding the impact of revenue recognition, was flat in local currency., EBITDA, volumes, sales mix, supply chain inventory write-offs, cost savings, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Brand volume decreased 2% as a result of lower volumes in the West and Ontario, partially offset by growth in Quebec. The introduction of Miller High Life early in the year and growth from Coors Banquet and Belgian Moon was more than offset by declines from other brands, including Coors Light and Molson Canadian., Brand volume, volumes, West, Ontario, Quebec, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Full year underlying EBITDA in Canada decreased 4.1% in local currency, driven by lower volumes, negative sales mix, one-time supply chain inventory write-offs, and inflation partially offset by cost savings and a 0.9% increase in net sales per hectoliter in local currency before revenue recognition. MG&A, excluding the impact of our revenue recognition, was up 2.3% in local currency., EBITDA, volumes, sales mix, supply chain inventory write-offs, cost savings, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Brand volume decreased 2.2% driven by industry declines in the West. The introduction of Miller High Life and growth from Belgian Moon were more than offset by declines from other brands, including Coors Light and Molson Canadian. Our total share trend has improved three quarters in a row, and Coors Light share of segment also improved three quarters in a row improving to flat in the fourth quarter., Brand volume, industry declines, Miller High Life, Belgian Moon, Coors Light, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In International, underlying EBITDA on a constant currency basis improved by $3.1 million in the quarter driven by increased profitability through a shift to local production in Mexico, higher brand volume in our focus markets, and lower MG&A. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales mix., EBITDA, constant currency, profitability, brand volume, MG&A, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Brand volume increased 1.1% driven by organic growth in our focus markets, led by Miller Lite, Blue Moon, and Miller High Life. Net sales per hectoliter decreased 18% in constant currency driven by the shift to local production in Mexico in favor of a license model, resulting in higher margins., Brand volume, organic growth, focus markets, Miller Lite, Blue Moon, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Our International business has increased its profitability substantially over the past year as we improved underlying EBITDA by approximately $19 million on a constant currency basis to $22.5 million, driven by the same factors as in the fourth quarter as well as improved profitability of our International focus brands, Coors Light, MGD and Miller Lite., EBITDA, constant currency, profitability, International business, focus brands, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Brand volume increased 2.2% driven by organic growth in our focus markets, led by Miller High Life, Miller Lite, and Blue Moon.

Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Now, moving to outlook, our earnings release provides full details of our guidance. As Mark said, we remain committed to our plan for rating agency leverage of approximately 3.75 times EBITDA around the middle of 2019, and the dividend intentions and EBITDA margin expansion guidance we communicated in June are unchanged., EBITDA margin expansion, dividend intentions, rating agency leverage, earnings release, outlook, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In terms of cost savings, we remain confident in the $700 million of savings for the three years ending 2019 and now also plan an added $450 million for the period 2020 through 2022., cost savings, $700 million, $450 million, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Procurement and supply chain, including brewery optimization, constitute the majority of these new savings, with IT and Global Business Services also contributing to the $450 million. We expect these savings to help fund our internal investment plans and the costs of achieving the savings, as well as offset input inflation, spread evenly over the period 2020 through 2022., Procurement, supply chain, brewery optimization, IT, Global Business Services, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We expect our International business to deliver a strong double-digit percentage increase to underlying EBITDA in constant currency for full year 2019. We estimate our underlying free cash flow of $1.4 billion, plus or minus 10% this year. We believe the main components of the difference between the midpoint of our estimate and consensus are lower estimates of capital spending, remember, we are still optimizing our brewery footprint in Canada; and higher estimates of cash taxes paid as a result of one-time opportunities realized with tax reform in 2018., EBITDA, free cash flow, capital spending, brewery footprint, tax reform, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We are no longer communicating guidance on cost of goods sold per hectoliter by business unit in favor of estimated cost of goods sold trends on a total company basis. Now, of course, the US remains the biggest driver of our cost of goods sold, and in 2019, we expect US costs of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a similar rate to our estimated consolidated percentage increase of up mid-single-digits. This amount reflects hedges on aluminum and other key inputs, is per hectoliter, and is on a constant currency basis versus 2018., cost of goods sold, cost of goods sold trends, total company basis, US costs of goods sold,\\nestimated consolidated percentage increase, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 4, Tracey I. Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As shared earlier, our US distributors ended 2018 with typical levels of inventory. This was below what we expected on our last earnings call due to lower-than-anticipated inventories outside of the Milwaukee brewery orbit. Milwaukee did see the expected build in preparation for the February go-live. We expect to complete implementation of our new ordering system across our US brewery network over the course of this year and foresee shipments converging with STRs for the year. Keep this in mind as you consider quarterly phasing in 2019., t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Swartzberg, Vice President of Investor Relations, Now, I\\'d like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mark Hunter., CEO, Mark Hunter, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thank you, Mark, and hello, and welcome everybody to the Molson Coors earnings call. With me on the call this morning are Tracey Joubert, our CFO; the CEOs of each of our four business units, Lee Reichert, our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; and Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller., CFO, Tracey Joubert, CEO, Lee Reichert, CEO, Brian\\nTabolt, Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer, Global Controller, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Today, Tracey and I will take you through our plans to drive long-term total shareholder returns, highlighting our third quarter results, and also discuss our outlook for the business. As usual, we\\'re offering related slides on the Investor Relations page of our website., Tracey Joubert, Third quarter results, Outlook for the\\nbusiness, Investor Relations page, Related slides, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Before doing that, I would like to take a moment to recognize the passing of Bill Coors earlier this month. Our Company stands on the shoulders of giants like Bill, who was the Chairman of Coors for over 40 years, and we honor his memory by rededicating ourselves to continuing the work he loved so much, brewing the highest quality beer to share with family and friends, one of life\\'s simple pleasures., Bill Coors, Chairman, Coors, memory, work, beer, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Now, this quarter reflects progress on a number of fronts as we drive our consistent First Choice strategy of earning more, using less and investing wisely. Brand volume grew in developed and developing markets outside of North America, NSR per hectoliter grew globally. We announced incremental cost reductions in the US to protect investment and counter inflation. We grew underlying EBITDA in constant currency in each of our four business units. We further paid down debt, as our teams across the business reduced working capital and cash taxes. And in early October, we completed the formation of Truss, our Canadian cannabis joint venture, naming Brett Vye as CEO. Brett is a long-standing commercial leader who most recently served as the Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer for our fast-growing International division., First Choice strategy, Brand volume, NSR per hectoliter, Incremental cost reductions, Underlying EBITDA, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In relation to debt paydown, we have generated $2.5 billion of underlying free cash flow since the end of 2016, we\\'re committed to $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10% in free cash flow this year. Additionally, we remain committed to our plan for rating agency leverage of 3.75 times by mid-2019, our current dividend payment, and the dividend intentions we communicated in June of this year., Debt paydown, free cash flow, rating agency leverage,\\ndividend payment, dividend intentions, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Let me now turn to underlying business trends and our outlook. The volume growth we are seeing outside North America is driven by consistency of our First Choice strategy, the breadth and depth of our global brand portfolio and a positive industry. Europe, our second largest business unit by volume, is growing consistently and accelerating the pace of portfolio premiumization, while our International business unit, led by the Latin American markets, posted mid-teens growth due to the strong performance of our global brands, led by Coors Light and the Miller trademark brands of MGD, Miller Lite and Miller High Life., First Choice strategy, volume growth, brand portfolio,\\nindustry, International business unit, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to North America. In the US, brand volumes or STRs were below industry volumes. As we have indicated, improving our volume performance in the US is a priority and the first step is to improve our share performance through Coors Light and accelerated premiumization of the portfolio. In the quarter, Coors Light STRs declined at a moderating rate sequentially. Miller Lite continued to take share in premium lights and also declined at a moderating rate. Above premium trends improved sequentially, benefiting from Peroni and Sol, our regional craft brands, Arnold Palmer Spiked and Henry\\'s Hard Sparkling., Coors Light, Miller Lite, premiumization, share\\nperformance, above premium trends, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In Canada, brand volume trends improved sequentially, and the Miller trademark and Belgian Moon brand grew strongly in the quarter. We continue to make progress in relation to stabilizing and improving the volume and profitability of our Canadian business and returning this business to growth., brand volume trends, Miller trademark, Belgian Moon brand,\\nCanadian business, volume and profitability, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Turning to outlook. We remain committed to our performance guidance for 2018, and I\\'ll comment in more detail on each of our business units after passing the call to Tracey. Before I do that, let me offer a few comments about how our organization is focused on earning more, using less and investing wisely by utilizing our profit after capital charge or PACC model. We believe we have the right strategy to grow shareholder value over the medium- to long-term. That strategy has delivered consistent business performance improvements over the past three years and, as I mentioned, we remain committed to our 2018 guidance despite a more challenging inflationary environment., outlook, performance guidance, business units, PACC model,\\nshareholder value, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In terms of top line performance, characterized as earning more, we continue to drive our First Choice approach, strengthening and premiumizing our brand portfolio, building powerful customer relationships and driving disruptive growth. To this last point, our new Truss cannabis joint venture is just one example of this. The combination of Molson Coors Canada and HEXO, the cannabis market leader in Quebec, offers a tremendous opportunity to shape the non-alcoholic cannabis-infused beverages category upon its planned legalization in Canada in the fall of 2019, and we believe we will secure a meaningful share of this potentially high value category and prepare ourselves for potential further international expansion., First Choice approach, brand portfolio, customer\\nrelationships, disruptive growth, cannabis joint venture, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Using less is our second platform and is designed to fuel growth and protect our bottom line performance. We are over-delivering on our synergy plan and we continue to make great progress on improving productivity through shared services, which is scaling rapidly, and world-class supply chain improvements. We also decided to execute incremental cost reductions in the US to protect our marketing investment and counter inflation and, as Tracey will cover, we expect to over-deliver on our current three-year total cost savings guidance., Using less, synergy plan, productivity, shared services,\\nsupply chain improvements, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Investing wisely is our third platform and we remain resolute on our deleverage commitments, returning cash to shareholders, currently planned via our dividend increase in 2019, and strengthening our business through brand-led growth opportunities., investing wisely, deleverage commitments, cash return to\\nshareholders, brand-led growth opportunities, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, I want to highlight our eighth year of recognition on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, reflecting not only our performance to index standards but also a series of activities that are aiding revenue and margins and ensuring we leave a positive beer print wherever we operate., Dow Jones Sustainability Index, revenue, margins, positive\\nbeer print, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thanks, Tracey. Earning more is one of the three platforms by which we drive PACC, and this pillar is built on commercial excellence. I\\'d like to give you some evidence of commercial excellence, starting with our success premiumizing globally then touching on how we are doing so in our four business units., earning more, commercial excellence, premiumizing,\\nbusiness units, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Across all of our markets, premiumization of our portfolio remains an important element of our strategy, and our above premium brands grew 3.6% in the quarter, driven principally by Europe and International, bringing their share of our total volume up to 21% of our portfolio from 20% last year., premiumization, portfolio, growth, markets, share, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In the US, we believe we have the right strategy and commercial execution to drive improving performance in response to current top line challenges. Premium light trends improved sequentially versus the first half, driven especially by the strong performance from Miller Lite. Our plans are to continue gaining share of segment in the American Light Lager category, with the bold competitive position of Miller Lite and reenergizing Coors Light as the world\\'s most refreshing beer. The brand has just launched a new Blue Mountain, Cold Beer digital campaign in October as part of our push to capture the attention of 21- to 34-year-old drinkers. Ryan Reis, who led the Miller Lite turnaround has recently become the leader of the Coors trademark and family of brands., premium light trends, Miller Lite, share segment, brand campaign, brand leader, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In above premium and craft, Peroni and Sol are posting the strongest percentage growth rates in their respective import segments, delivering highly profitable incremental cases to distributors and retailers. We\\'ll build on the success from Sol with the introduction of the best-selling Mexican ready-to-drink chelada next year. Our regional craft brands continue to grow strongly and build their regional footprint. One of our regional craft brands, Saint Archer, will test a new lower calorie and lower carb craft lager, Saint Archer Gold, early next year in four markets., premium, craft, Peroni, Sol, Mexican chelada, Saint Archer Gold, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In FMBs, our Q3 performance was an improvement sequentially, reflecting growing contribution from Henry\\'s Hard Sparkling, the only sugar-free hard seltzer, and Arnold Palmer Spiked. And we are also excited about the introduction of Cape Line next year, a new line of low calorie FMBs to be supported by national advertising., Henry\\'s Hard Sparkling, Arnold Palmer Spiked, Cape Line,\\nlow calorie FMBs, national advertising, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Finally, in terms of customer excellence, our US sales teams were recognized as the number one chain team in the most recent Advantage Group survey among all branded beverages. And this is a real testament to driving our First Choice for customer agenda., customer excellence, sales teams, Advantage Group, First\\nChoice, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In Europe, core brands grew, and our above premium brands grew at high-single digit rates in the quarter. For example, global brands Coors Light, MGD, and Blue Moon collectively grew double-digits in the quarter, and Staropramen is nearing 2 million hectoliters in markets outside of its home Czech market. We believe we have the right strategy in Europe, defending our share of national champion brands, while premiumizing our portfolio and driving profitability through innovation, and added strength for our global brands, and our superior execution., core brands, above premium brands, global brands,\\nStaropramen, strategy, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, In Canada, our commercial performance improved sequentially. We simplified our value segment offerings with the Pilsner and Black Label brands and lifted and shifted the Miller High Life brand into Canada, gaining additional segment share. We saw sequentially improving segment share for Coors Light. And we are driving category development in the non-alcohol segment through Coors Edge, our newest non-alcoholic offering, along with our partner brand Heineken 0.0, which are both performing very strongly in their first year in market., commercial performance, value segment offerings, Miller\\nHigh Life, Coors Light, non-alcohol segment, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, And we are investing wisely, expecting future operating efficiencies through our new highly efficient brewery in British Columbia, which remains on track for brewing in 2019, and the new brewery in Quebec, which had its groundbreaking ceremony earlier this month., new brewery, operating efficiencies, British Columbia,\\nQuebec, groundbreaking ceremony, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Our International business is expected to continue to contribute meaningful volume and profitability to the Company, with our commercial efforts centered on focus brands in focus markets. Two of these high potential focus markets include Mexico, with our shift to local production reflecting increased profitability, and Paraguay, growing significantly this quarter with MGD now the top brand in the premium segment. We remain focused on delivering underlying constant currency EBITDA of $20 million to $25 million this year in our International business., International business, focus brands, focus markets, local\\nproduction, premium segment, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Across Molson Coors we are over-delivering on our synergy and cost savings program to counter higher than anticipated commodity inflation and maintain our deleverage commitment and dividend plan., synergy, cost savings, commodity inflation, deleverage,\\ndividend plan, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Coming back to PACC and our efforts to drive shareholder value, we are pleased to be deleveraging at the pace we are and look forward to upping our cash returns to shareholders next year, while taking a more balanced approach to capital allocation., deleveraging, cash returns, capital allocation,\\nshareholder value, pace, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, So with that summary, remember our prepared remarks and slides will be on our website for your reference later this afternoon, Mark and Kevin will be available via telephone or email to assist with any additional questions., summary, prepared remarks, slides, website, questions, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer, Well, Chad, at this stage, we\\'d like to open up for questions, please., new brewery, operating efficiencies, British Columbia, Quebec, groundbreaking ceremony, International business, focus brands, focus markets, local production, premium segment, synergy,\\ncost savings, commodity inflation, deleverage, dividend plan, deleveraging, cash returns, capital\\nallocation, shareholder value, pace, summary, prepared remarks, slides, website, questions, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Thank you, Mark, and hello everybody. Before I share consolidated and regional financial highlights, I\\'d like to remind you of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which we will refer to as the revenue recognition for the remainder of the prepared remarks today. As outlined in our earnings release, this is expected to have no significant impact to net income for the full year, but will cause some timing differences between quarters, impacting some year-over-year comparability for net sales and MG&A, primarily in the US and Canada this quarter. For example, revenue recognition positively impacted EPS by $0.02 this quarter and negatively impacted EPS by $0.04 on a year-to-date basis, but this timing difference is expected to partially reverse and result in a benefit of approximately $0.03 in the fourth quarter., new revenue recognition accounting standard, revenue recognition, net sales, MG&A, EPS, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, I will speak first to the quarter on a consolidated and regional basis, then to anticipated savings, and finally to our capital allocation plans. Turning to our performance for the quarter, as highlighted in our earnings release. Net sales increased 2.5% in constant currency. Net sales per hectoliter, on a brand volume basis, increased 0.4% in constant currency. Worldwide brand volume decreased 1% and financial volume increased 0.8%. Global priority brand volume decreased 1.4%., net sales, net sales per hectoliter, brand volume, worldwide brand volume, financial volume, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Underlying EBITDA increased 11.1% on a constant currency basis. And looking more closely at Q3, two specific positive performance drivers benefited EBITDA in the quarter. First, shipments to support ordering system implementations at our US breweries as indicated and forecast in both our Q1 and Q2 calls. These shipments increased distributor inventory levels -- sorry, inventory to levels at which they are expected to remain through the end of the year. This is in order to prepare for future implementations at our remaining breweries, which are expected to occur in 2019. And second, the amicable resolution of a dispute with a US vendor., EBITDA, constant currency, shipments, inventory, dispute, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Financial highlights for the regions include the following. In the US, underlying EBITDA increased 10.2% versus last year, driven by higher STWs from an increase in distributor inventories, higher net pricing and lower MG&A expenses, partially offset by higher COGS, particularly aluminum and freight. Our top line growth this quarter was driven by the planned increase in US distributor inventories and NSR per hectoliter growth., EBITDA, STWs, net pricing, MG&A expenses, COGS, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, In Europe, underlying EBITDA increased 5.8% on a constant currency basis driven by top line results, with both volume and NSR per hectoliter growth. Bottom line results also benefited from strong cost management and more efficient marketing investments. As discussed on our prior calls this year, when modeling the results of Europe, remember that Q4 historically represents a small quarter for Europe and also faces the headwind of a low-single digit negative impact this quarter to NSR per hectoliter related to the adoption of recently revised industry guidelines for calculating excise tax., EBITDA, constant currency, top line results, bottom line results, cost management, marketing\\ninvestments, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Our Canada underlying EBITDA increased 3.5% on a constant currency basis. The top line reflected a 1.4% decline in brand volume as a result of lower volumes in the West, partially offset by volume growth in Ontario and Quebec. When excluding the effect of revenue recognition, NSR per hectoliter would have increased 1.6%., EBITDA, constant currency, top line, brand volume, NSR per hectoliter, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Regarding International, underlying EBITDA grew as the top line benefited from an increase in brand volume as all three focus brands, Coors Light, MGD and Miller Lite, generated growth. The bottom line also reflected gross profit expansion, in addition to lower MG&A spending levels., EBITDA, top line, brand volume, gross profit expansion, MG&A spending levels, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, Our earnings release provides full details on our outlook for guidance, and I\\'ll comment on three of those items here. To counter the heightened inflationary environment, especially in the US as it relates to aluminum and freight costs, we will over-deliver on our cost savings targets and cost mitigation efforts in order to deliver on our cash flow commitments, both for 2018 and 2019. We will update our actual 2017 to 2019 cost savings targets and performance, as well as our next generation of cost savings for 2020 to 2022, in Q1 of 2019. However, as of now, with the additional cost savings initiatives in the US, as well as other cost savings initiatives, our 2017 to 2019 program will deliver approximately $700 million versus the $600 million to which we guided previously., EBITDA, cost savings targets, cost mitigation efforts, cash flow commitments, cost savings\\ninitiatives, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, We expect corporate net interest expense for 2018 to be near the low end of our $330 million, plus or minus 10% guidance range. And we have lowered our expected underlying effective tax rate for 2018 to 17% to 19% from 18% to 22%. We still expect free cash flow to be $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10% this year.,  corporate net interest expense,  expected underlying effective tax rate,  free cash flow,\\n guidance range,  expected underlying EBITDA, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As Mark said, we remain committed to our plan for rating agency leverage of 3.75 times by mid-2019, our current dividend payment, and our dividend intentions are unchanged versus what we communicated in June.,  rating agency leverage,  dividend payment,  dividend intentions,  mid-2019, \\ncurrent dividend, Molson Coors Beverage\\nTAP, 2018, 3, Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer, As for business investment, we continue to use PACC to inform and guide all of our decisions.

The pandemic led to a decline in consumer spending, particularly in the away-from-home segment, which includes restaurants, cafes, and other foodservice establishments. This resulted in a decline in sales for beverage companies, including The Coca-Cola Company. However, the company was able to adapt to the changing market conditions by implementing various strategies, such as real-time network collaboration, local market strategies, and dynamic resource allocation. Additionally, the company focused on brand building, innovation, and revenue growth management, which helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Overall, while the pandemic had a significant impact on the industry in 2020, The Coca-Cola Company was able to navigate the challenges and emerge stronger.\n"
